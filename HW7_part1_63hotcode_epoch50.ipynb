       "b'mysticism and logic and other essays\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\r\\nmysticism and logic\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmetaphysics, or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means\\r\\nof thought, has been developed, from the first, by the union and\\r\\nconflict of two very different human impulses, the one urging men\\r\\ntowards mysticism, the other urging them towards science. some men\\r\\nhave achieved greatness through one of these impulses alone, others\\r\\nthrough the other alone: in hume, for example, the scientific impulse\\r\\nreigns quite unchecked, while in blake a strong hostility to science\\r\\nco-exists with profound mystic insight. but the greatest men who have\\r\\nbeen philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism:\\r\\nthe attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what\\r\\nalways must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some\\r\\nminds, a greater thing than either science or religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore attempting an explicit characterisation of the scientific and\\r\\nthe mystical impulses, i will illustrate them by examples from two\\r\\nphilosophers whose greatness lies in the very intimate blending which\\r\\nthey achieved. the two philosophers i mean are heraclitus and plato.\\r\\n\\r\\nheraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in universal flux: time\\r\\nbuilds and destroys all things. from the few fragments that remain, it\\r\\nis not easy to discover how he arrived at his opinions, but there are\\r\\nsome sayings that strongly suggest scientific observation as the\\r\\nsource.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the things that can be seen, heard, and learned,\" he says, \"are what\\r\\ni prize the most.\" this is the language of the empiricist, to whom\\r\\nobservation is the sole guarantee of truth. \"the sun is new every\\r\\nday,\" is another fragment; and this opinion, in spite of its\\r\\nparadoxical character, is obviously inspired by scientific reflection,\\r\\nand no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding\\r\\nhow the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the\\r\\nnight. actual observation must also have suggested to him his central\\r\\ndoctrine, that fire is the one permanent substance, of which all\\r\\nvisible things are passing phases. in combustion we see things change\\r\\nutterly, while their flame and heat rise up into the air and vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"this world, which is the same for all,\" he says, \"no one of gods or\\r\\nmen has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be, an\\r\\never-living fire, with measures kindling, and measures going out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the transformations of fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the\\r\\nsea is earth, half whirlwind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis theory, though no longer one which science can accept, is\\r\\nnevertheless scientific in spirit. science, too, might have inspired\\r\\nthe famous saying to which plato alludes: \"you cannot step twice into\\r\\nthe same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\" but\\r\\nwe find also another statement among the extant fragments: \"we step\\r\\nand do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe comparison of this statement, which is mystical, with the one\\r\\nquoted by plato, which is scientific, shows how intimately the two\\r\\ntendencies are blended in the system of heraclitus. mysticism is, in\\r\\nessence, little more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in\\r\\nregard to what is believed about the universe; and this kind of\\r\\nfeeling leads heraclitus, on the basis of his science, to strangely\\r\\npoignant sayings concerning life and the world, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nit is poetic imagination, not science, which presents time as despotic\\r\\nlord of the world, with all the irresponsible frivolity of a child. it\\r\\nis mysticism, too, which leads heraclitus to assert the identity of\\r\\nopposites: \"good and ill are one,\" he says; and again: \"to god all\\r\\nthings are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and\\r\\nsome right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmuch of mysticism underlies the ethics of heraclitus. it is true that\\r\\na scientific determinism alone might have inspired the statement:\\r\\n\"man\\'s character is his fate\"; but only a mystic would have said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"every beast is driven to the pasture with blows\"; and again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"it is hard to fight with one\\'s heart\\'s desire. whatever it wishes to\\r\\nget, it purchases at the cost of soul\"; and again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"wisdom is one thing. it is to know the thought by which all things\\r\\nare steered through all things.\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nexamples might be multiplied, but those that have been given are\\r\\nenough to show the character of the man: the facts of science, as they\\r\\nappeared to him, fed the flame in his soul, and in its light he saw\\r\\ninto the depths of the world by the reflection of his own dancing\\r\\nswiftly penetrating fire. in such a nature we see the true union of\\r\\nthe mystic and the man of science--the highest eminence, as i think,\\r\\nthat it is possible to achieve in the world of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nin plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the mystic impulse\\r\\nis distinctly the stronger of the two, and secures ultimate victory\\r\\nwhenever the conflict is sharp. his description of the cave is the\\r\\nclassical statement of belief in a knowledge and reality truer and\\r\\nmore real than that of the senses:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"imagine[2] a number of men living in an underground cavernous\\r\\n  chamber, with an entrance open to the light, extending along the\\r\\n  entire length of the cavern, in which they have been confined, from\\r\\n  their childhood, with their legs and necks so shackled that they\\r\\n  are obliged to sit still and look straight forwards, because their\\r\\n  chains render it impossible for them to turn their heads round: and\\r\\n  imagine a bright fire burning some way off, above and behind them,\\r\\n  and an elevated roadway passing between the fire and the prisoners,\\r\\n  with a low wall built along it, like the screens which conjurors\\r\\n  put up in front of their audience, and above which they exhibit\\r\\n  their wonders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  i have it, he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  also figure to yourself a number of persons walking behind this\\r\\n  wall, and carrying with them statues of men, and images of other\\r\\n  animals, wrought in wood and stone and all kinds of materials,\\r\\n  together with various other articles, which overtop the wall; and,\\r\\n  as you might expect, let some of the passers-by be talking, and\\r\\n  others silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n  you are describing a strange scene, and strange prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\n  they resemble us, i replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  now consider what would happen if the course of nature brought them\\r\\n  a release from their fetters, and a remedy for their foolishness,\\r\\n  in the following manner. let us suppose that one of them has been\\r\\n  released, and compelled suddenly to stand up, and turn his neck\\r\\n  round and walk with open eyes towards the light; and let us suppose\\r\\n  that he goes through all these actions with pain, and that the\\r\\n  dazzling splendour renders him incapable of discerning those\\r\\n  objects of which he used formerly to see the shadows. what answer\\r\\n  should you expect him to make, if some one were to tell him that in\\r\\n  those days he was watching foolish phantoms, but that now he is\\r\\n  somewhat nearer to reality, and is turned towards things more real,\\r\\n  and sees more correctly; above all, if he were to point out to him\\r\\n  the several objects that are passing by, and question him, and\\r\\n  compel him to answer what they are? should you not expect him to be\\r\\n  puzzled, and to regard his old visions as truer than the objects\\r\\n  now forced upon his notice?\\r\\n\\r\\n  yes, much truer....\\r\\n\\r\\n  hence, i suppose, habit will be necessary to enable him to perceive\\r\\n  objects in that upper world. at first he will be most successful in\\r\\n  distinguishing shadows; then he will discern the reflections of men\\r\\n  and other things in water, and afterwards the realities; and after\\r\\n  this he will raise his eyes to encounter the light of the moon and\\r\\n  stars, finding it less difficult to study the heavenly bodies and\\r\\n  the heaven itself by night, than the sun and the sun\\'s light by\\r\\n  day.\\r\\n\\r\\n  doubtless.\\r\\n\\r\\n  last of all, i imagine, he will be able to observe and contemplate\\r\\n  the nature of the sun, not as it _appears_ in water or on alien\\r\\n  ground, but as it is in itself in its own territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n  of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n  his next step will be to draw the conclusion, that the sun is the\\r\\n  author of the seasons and the years, and the guardian of all things\\r\\n  in the visible world, and in a manner the cause of all those things\\r\\n  which he and his companions used to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n  obviously, this will be his next step....\\r\\n\\r\\n  now this imaginary case, my dear glancon, you must apply in all its\\r\\n  parts to our former statements, by comparing the region which the\\r\\n  eye reveals to the prison house, and the light of the fire therein\\r\\n  to the power of the sun: and if, by the upward ascent and the\\r\\n  contemplation of the upper world, you understand the mounting of\\r\\n  the soul into the intellectual region, you will hit the tendency of\\r\\n  my own surmises, since you desire to be told what they are; though,\\r\\n  indeed, god only knows whether they are correct. but, be that as it\\r\\n  may, the view which i take of the subject is to the following\\r\\n  effect. in the world of knowledge, the essential form of good is\\r\\n  the limit of our enquiries, and can barely be perceived; but, when\\r\\n  perceived, we cannot help concluding that it is in every case the\\r\\n  source of all that is bright and beautiful,--in the visible world\\r\\n  giving birth to light and its master, and in the intellectual world\\r\\n  dispensing, immediately and with full authority, truth and\\r\\n  reason;--and that whosoever would act wisely, either in private or\\r\\n  in public, must set this form of good before his eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut in this passage, as throughout most of plato\\'s teaching, there is\\r\\nan identification of the good with the truly real, which became\\r\\nembodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely\\r\\noperative in our own day. in thus allowing a legislative function to\\r\\nthe good, plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science,\\r\\nfrom which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still\\r\\nsuffering. the man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay\\r\\nthem aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, if he is to\\r\\nachieve truth, must do the same. ethical considerations can only\\r\\nlegitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and\\r\\nshould appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our\\r\\nmanner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as\\r\\nthemselves dictating what the truth is to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are passages in plato--among those which illustrate the\\r\\nscientific side of his mind--where he seems clearly aware of this. the\\r\\nmost noteworthy is the one in which socrates, as a young man, is\\r\\nexplaining the theory of ideas to parmenides.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter socrates has explained that there is an idea of the good, but\\r\\nnot of such things as hair and mud and dirt, parmenides advises him\\r\\n\"not to despise even the meanest things,\" and this advice shows the\\r\\ngenuine scientific temper. it is with this impartial temper that the\\r\\nmystic\\'s apparent insight into a higher reality and a hidden good has\\r\\nto be combined if philosophy is to realise its greatest possibilities.\\r\\nand it is failure in this respect that has made so much of idealistic\\r\\nphilosophy thin, lifeless, and insubstantial. it is only in marriage\\r\\nwith the world that our ideals can bear fruit: divorced from it, they\\r\\nremain barren. but marriage with the world is not to be achieved by an\\r\\nideal which shrinks from fact, or demands in advance that the world\\r\\nshall conform to its desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nparmenides himself is the source of a peculiarly interesting strain\\r\\nof mysticism which pervades plato\\'s thought--the mysticism which may\\r\\nbe called \"logical\" because it is embodied in theories on logic. this\\r\\nform of mysticism, which appears, so far as the west is concerned, to\\r\\nhave originated with parmenides, dominates the reasonings of all the\\r\\ngreat mystical metaphysicians from his day to that of hegel and his\\r\\nmodern disciples. reality, he says, is uncreated, indestructible,\\r\\nunchanging, indivisible; it is \"immovable in the bonds of mighty\\r\\nchains, without beginning and without end; since coming into being and\\r\\npassing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them\\r\\naway.\" the fundamental principle of his inquiry is stated in a\\r\\nsentence which would not be out of place in hegel: \"thou canst not\\r\\nknow what is not--that is impossible--nor utter it; for it is the same\\r\\nthing that can be thought and that can be.\" and again: \"it needs must\\r\\nbe that what can be thought and spoken of is; for it is possible for\\r\\nit to be, and it is not possible for what is nothing to be.\" the\\r\\nimpossibility of change follows from this principle; for what is past\\r\\ncan be spoken of, and therefore, by the principle, still is.\\r\\n\\r\\nmystical philosophy, in all ages and in all parts of the world, is\\r\\ncharacterised by certain beliefs which are illustrated by the\\r\\ndoctrines we have been considering.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, first, the belief in insight as against discursive analytic\\r\\nknowledge: the belief in a way of wisdom, sudden, penetrating,\\r\\ncoercive, which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of\\r\\noutward appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses. all\\r\\nwho are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have\\r\\nexperienced at times the strange feeling of unreality in common\\r\\nobjects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity\\r\\nof the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness,\\r\\nto bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic\\r\\nphantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and\\r\\nliving. this is the negative side of the mystic\\'s initiation: the\\r\\ndoubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception\\r\\nof what seems a higher wisdom. many men to whom this negative\\r\\nexperience is familiar do not pass beyond it, but for the mystic it is\\r\\nmerely the gateway to an ampler world.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mystic insight begins with the sense of a mystery unveiled, of a\\r\\nhidden wisdom now suddenly become certain beyond the possibility of a\\r\\ndoubt. the sense of certainty and revelation comes earlier than any\\r\\ndefinite belief. the definite beliefs at which mystics arrive are the\\r\\nresult of reflection upon the inarticulate experience gained in the\\r\\nmoment of insight. often, beliefs which have no real connection with\\r\\nthis moment become subsequently attracted into the central nucleus;\\r\\nthus in addition to the convictions which all mystics share, we find,\\r\\nin many of them, other convictions of a more local and temporary\\r\\ncharacter, which no doubt become amalgamated with what was essentially\\r\\nmystical in virtue of their subjective certainty. we may ignore such\\r\\ninessential accretions, and confine ourselves to the beliefs which all\\r\\nmystics share.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is\\r\\nbelief in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called\\r\\nrevelation or insight or intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason,\\r\\nand analysis, which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass\\r\\nof illusion. closely connected with this belief is the conception of a\\r\\nreality behind the world of appearance and utterly different from it.\\r\\nthis reality is regarded with an admiration often amounting to\\r\\nworship; it is felt to be always and everywhere close at hand, thinly\\r\\nveiled by the shows of sense, ready, for the receptive mind, to shine\\r\\nin its glory even through the apparent folly and wickedness of man.\\r\\nthe poet, the artist, and the lover are seekers after that glory: the\\r\\nhaunting beauty that they pursue is the faint reflection of its sun.\\r\\nbut the mystic lives in the full light of the vision: what others\\r\\ndimly seek he knows, with a knowledge beside which all other knowledge\\r\\nis ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second characteristic of mysticism is its belief in unity, and its\\r\\nrefusal to admit opposition or division anywhere. we found heraclitus\\r\\nsaying \"good and ill are one\"; and again he says, \"the way up and the\\r\\nway down is one and the same.\" the same attitude appears in the\\r\\nsimultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions, such as: \"we\\r\\nstep and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\" the\\r\\nassertion of parmenides, that reality is one and indivisible, comes\\r\\nfrom the same impulse towards unity. in plato, this impulse is less\\r\\nprominent, being held in check by his theory of ideas; but it\\r\\nreappears, so far as his logic permits, in the doctrine of the primacy\\r\\nof the good.\\r\\n\\r\\na third mark of almost all mystical metaphysics is the denial of the\\r\\nreality of time. this is an outcome of the denial of division; if all\\r\\nis one, the distinction of past and future must be illusory. we have\\r\\nseen this doctrine prominent in parmenides; and among moderns it is\\r\\nfundamental in the systems of spinoza and hegel.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe last of the doctrines of mysticism which we have to consider is\\r\\nits belief that all evil is mere appearance, an illusion produced by\\r\\nthe divisions and oppositions of the analytic intellect. mysticism\\r\\ndoes not maintain that such things as cruelty, for example, are good,\\r\\nbut it denies that they are real: they belong to that lower world of\\r\\nphantoms from which we are to be liberated by the insight of the\\r\\nvision. sometimes--for example in hegel, and at least verbally in\\r\\nspinoza--not only evil, but good also, is regarded as illusory, though\\r\\nnevertheless the emotional attitude towards what is held to be reality\\r\\nis such as would naturally be associated with the belief that reality\\r\\nis good. what is, in all cases, ethically characteristic of mysticism\\r\\nis absence of indignation or protest, acceptance with joy, disbelief\\r\\nin the ultimate truth of the division into two hostile camps, the good\\r\\nand the bad. this attitude is a direct outcome of the nature of the\\r\\nmystical experience: with its sense of unity is associated a feeling\\r\\nof infinite peace. indeed it may be suspected that the feeling of\\r\\npeace produces, as feelings do in dreams, the whole system of\\r\\nassociated beliefs which make up the body of mystic doctrine. but this\\r\\nis a difficult question, and one on which it cannot be hoped that\\r\\nmankind will reach agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nfour questions thus arise in considering the truth or falsehood of\\r\\nmysticism, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n  i. are there two ways of knowing, which may be called respectively\\r\\n  reason and intuition? and if so, is either to be preferred to the\\r\\n  other?\\r\\n\\r\\n  ii. is all plurality and division illusory?\\r\\n\\r\\n  iii. is time unreal?\\r\\n\\r\\n  iv. what kind of reality belongs to good and evil?\\r\\n\\r\\non all four of these questions, while fully developed mysticism seems\\r\\nto me mistaken, i yet believe that, by sufficient restraint, there is\\r\\nan element of wisdom to be learned from the mystical way of feeling,\\r\\nwhich does not seem to be attainable in any other manner. if this is\\r\\nthe truth, mysticism is to be commended as an attitude towards life,\\r\\nnot as a creed about the world. the meta-physical creed, i shall\\r\\nmaintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion, although this emotion,\\r\\nas colouring and informing all other thoughts and feelings, is the\\r\\ninspirer of whatever is best in man. even the cautious and patient\\r\\ninvestigation of truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of\\r\\nthe mystic\\'s swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that\\r\\nvery spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni. reason and intuition[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nof the reality or unreality of the mystic\\'s world i know nothing. i\\r\\nhave no wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which\\r\\nreveals it is not a genuine insight. what i do wish to maintain--and\\r\\nit is here that the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that\\r\\ninsight, untested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of\\r\\ntruth, in spite of the fact that much of the most important truth is\\r\\nfirst suggested by its means. it is common to speak of an opposition\\r\\nbetween instinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition\\r\\nwas drawn in favour of reason, but under the influence of rousseau and\\r\\nthe romantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by\\r\\nthose who rebelled against artificial forms of government and thought,\\r\\nand then, as the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology\\r\\nbecame increasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to\\r\\ncreeds which they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the\\r\\nworld. bergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to\\r\\nthe position of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. but in fact the\\r\\nopposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. instinct,\\r\\nintuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which\\r\\nsubsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it\\r\\nis possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other\\r\\nbeliefs no less instinctive. reason is a harmonising, controlling\\r\\nforce rather than a creative one. even in the most purely logical\\r\\nrealm, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single\\r\\nbeliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no\\r\\ndegree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment.\\r\\ninstinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. those in whom\\r\\nreason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards\\r\\nthemselves, though all admit it in regard to others. where instinct is\\r\\nleast liable to error is in practical matters as to which right\\r\\njudgment is a help to survival: friendship and hostility in others,\\r\\nfor instance, are often felt with extraordinary discrimination through\\r\\nvery careful disguises. but even in such matters a wrong impression\\r\\nmay be given by reserve or flattery; and in matters less directly\\r\\npractical, such as philosophy deals with, very strong instinctive\\r\\nbeliefs are sometimes wholly mistaken, as we may come to know through\\r\\ntheir perceived inconsistency with other equally strong beliefs. it is\\r\\nsuch considerations that necessitate the harmonising mediation of\\r\\nreason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual compatibility, and\\r\\nexamines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of error on the one\\r\\nside and on the other. in this there is no opposition to instinct as a\\r\\nwhole, but only to blind reliance upon some one interesting aspect of\\r\\ninstinct to the exclusion of other more commonplace but not less\\r\\ntrustworthy aspects. it is such one-sidedness, not instinct itself,\\r\\nthat reason aims at correcting.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to\\r\\nbergson\\'s advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" there are,\\r\\nhe says, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. the first\\r\\nimplies that we move round the object: the second that we enter into\\r\\nit. the first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and\\r\\non the symbols by which we express ourselves. the second neither\\r\\ndepends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol. the first kind of\\r\\nknowledge may be said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those\\r\\ncases where it is possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[4] the second\\r\\nof these, which is intuition, is, he says, \"the kind of _intellectual\\r\\nsympathy_ by which one places oneself within an object in order to\\r\\ncoincide with what is unique in it and therefore inexpressible\" (p.\\r\\n6). in illustration, he mentions self-knowledge: \"there is one\\r\\nreality, at least, which we all seize from within, by intuition and\\r\\nnot by simple analysis. it is our own personality in its flowing\\r\\nthrough time--our self which endures\" (p. 8). the rest of bergson\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy consists in reporting, through the imperfect medium of\\r\\nwords, the knowledge gained by intuition, and the consequent complete\\r\\ncondemnation of all the pretended knowledge derived from science and\\r\\ncommon sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive\\r\\nbeliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater\\r\\ntrustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.\\r\\nbergson attempts this justification in two ways, first by explaining\\r\\nthat intellect is a purely practical faculty to secure biological\\r\\nsuccess, secondly by mentioning remarkable feats of instinct in\\r\\nanimals and by pointing out characteristics of the world which, though\\r\\nintuition can apprehend them, are baffling to intellect as he\\r\\ninterprets it.\\r\\n\\r\\nof bergson\\'s theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty,\\r\\ndeveloped in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true\\r\\nbeliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we\\r\\nknow of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of\\r\\nman: if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred\\r\\nhistory is presumably untrue. if, on the other hand, we agree with him\\r\\nin thinking that evolution took place as darwin believed, then it is\\r\\nnot only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been developed\\r\\nunder the stress of practical utility. intuition is seen at its best\\r\\nwhere it is directly useful, for example in regard to other people\\'s\\r\\ncharacters and dispositions. bergson apparently holds that capacity\\r\\nfor this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle for\\r\\nexistence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. yet the\\r\\nsavage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake\\r\\nwith his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are\\r\\nnot put to death for mathematical incompetence. all the most striking\\r\\nof his instances of intuition in animals have a very direct survival\\r\\nvalue. the fact is, of course, that both intuition and intellect have\\r\\nbeen developed because they are useful, and that, speaking broadly,\\r\\nthey are useful when they give truth and become harmful when they give\\r\\nfalsehood. intellect, in civilised man, like artistic capacity, has\\r\\noccasionally been developed beyond the point where it is useful to the\\r\\nindividual; intuition, on the other hand, seems on the whole to\\r\\ndiminish as civilisation increases. it is greater, as a rule, in\\r\\nchildren than in adults, in the uneducated than in the educated.\\r\\nprobably in dogs it exceeds anything to be found in human beings. but\\r\\nthose who see in these facts a recommendation of intuition ought to\\r\\nreturn to running wild in the woods, dyeing themselves with woad and\\r\\nliving on hips and haws.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us next examine whether intuition possesses any such infallibility\\r\\nas bergson claims for it. the best instance of it, according to him,\\r\\nis our acquaintance with ourselves; yet self-knowledge is proverbially\\r\\nrare and difficult. most men, for example, have in their nature\\r\\nmeannesses, vanities, and envies of which they are quite unconscious,\\r\\nthough even their best friends can perceive them without any\\r\\ndifficulty. it is true that intuition has a convincingness which is\\r\\nlacking to intellect: while it is present, it is almost impossible to\\r\\ndoubt its truth. but if it should appear, on examination, to be at\\r\\nleast as fallible as intellect, its greater subjective certainty\\r\\nbecomes a demerit, making it only the more irresistibly deceptive.\\r\\napart from self-knowledge, one of the most notable examples of\\r\\nintuition is the knowledge people believe themselves to possess of\\r\\nthose with whom they are in love: the wall between different\\r\\npersonalities seems to become transparent, and people think they see\\r\\ninto another soul as into their own. yet deception in such cases is\\r\\nconstantly practised with success; and even where there is no\\r\\nintentional deception, experience gradually proves, as a rule, that\\r\\nthe supposed insight was illusory, and that the slower more groping\\r\\nmethods of the intellect are in the long run more reliable.\\r\\n\\r\\nbergson maintains that intellect can only deal with things in so far\\r\\nas they resemble what has been experienced in the past, while\\r\\nintuition has the power of apprehending the uniqueness and novelty\\r\\nthat always belong to each fresh moment. that there is something\\r\\nunique and new at every moment, is certainly true; it is also true\\r\\nthat this cannot be fully expressed by means of intellectual concepts.\\r\\nonly direct acquaintance can give knowledge of what is unique and new.\\r\\nbut direct acquaintance of this kind is given fully in sensation, and\\r\\ndoes not require, so far as i can see, any special faculty of\\r\\nintuition for its apprehension. it is neither intellect nor intuition,\\r\\nbut sensation, that supplies new data; but when the data are new in\\r\\nany remarkable manner, intellect is much more capable of dealing with\\r\\nthem than intuition would be. the hen with a brood of ducklings no\\r\\ndoubt has intuition which seems to place her inside them, and not\\r\\nmerely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the\\r\\nwater, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the\\r\\nhen is left helpless on the shore. intuition, in fact, is an aspect\\r\\nand development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is admirable in\\r\\nthose customary surroundings which have moulded the habits of the\\r\\nanimal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the\\r\\nsurroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode\\r\\nof action.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of\\r\\nphilosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals,\\r\\nor to savages, or even to most civilised men. it is hardly to be\\r\\nsupposed, therefore, that the rapid, rough and ready methods of\\r\\ninstinct or intuition will find in this field a favourable ground for\\r\\ntheir application. it is the older kinds of activity, which bring out\\r\\nour kinship with remote generations of animal and semi-human\\r\\nancestors, that show intuition at its best. in such matters as\\r\\nself-preservation and love, intuition will act sometimes (though not\\r\\nalways) with a swiftness and precision which are astonishing to the\\r\\ncritical intellect. but philosophy is not one of the pursuits which\\r\\nillustrate our affinity with the past: it is a highly refined, highly\\r\\ncivilised pursuit, demanding, for its success, a certain liberation\\r\\nfrom the life of instinct, and even, at times, a certain aloofness\\r\\nfrom all mundane hopes and fears. it is not in philosophy, therefore,\\r\\nthat we can hope to see intuition at its best. on the contrary, since\\r\\nthe true objects of philosophy, and the habit of thought demanded for\\r\\ntheir apprehension, are strange, unusual, and remote, it is here, more\\r\\nalmost than anywhere else, that intellect proves superior to\\r\\nintuition, and that quick unanalysed convictions are least deserving\\r\\nof uncritical acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\nin advocating the scientific restraint and balance, as against the\\r\\nself-assertion of a confident reliance upon intuition, we are only\\r\\nurging, in the sphere of knowledge, that largeness of contemplation,\\r\\nthat impersonal disinterestedness, and that freedom from practical\\r\\npreoccupations which have been inculcated by all the great religions\\r\\nof the world. thus our conclusion, however it may conflict with the\\r\\nexplicit beliefs of many mystics, is, in essence, not contrary to the\\r\\nspirit which inspires those beliefs, but rather the outcome of this\\r\\nvery spirit as applied in the realm of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nii. unity and plurality\\r\\n\\r\\none of the most convincing aspects of the mystic illumination is the\\r\\napparent revelation of the oneness of all things, giving rise to\\r\\npantheism in religion and to monism in philosophy. an elaborate logic,\\r\\nbeginning with parmenides, and culminating in hegel and his followers,\\r\\nhas been gradually developed, to prove that the universe is one\\r\\nindivisible whole, and that what seem to be its parts, if considered\\r\\nas substantial and self-existing, are mere illusion. the conception\\r\\nof a reality quite other than the world of appearance, a reality one,\\r\\nindivisible, and unchanging, was introduced into western philosophy by\\r\\nparmenides, not, nominally at least, for mystical or religious\\r\\nreasons, but on the basis of a logical argument as to the\\r\\nimpossibility of not-being, and most subsequent metaphysical systems\\r\\nare the outcome of this fundamental idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logic used in defence of mysticism seems to be faulty as logic,\\r\\nand open to technical criticisms, which i have explained elsewhere. i\\r\\nshall not here repeat these criticisms, since they are lengthy and\\r\\ndifficult, but shall instead attempt an analysis of the state of mind\\r\\nfrom which mystical logic has arisen.\\r\\n\\r\\nbelief in a reality quite different from what appears to the senses\\r\\narises with irresistible force in certain moods, which are the source\\r\\nof most mysticism, and of most metaphysics. while such a mood is\\r\\ndominant, the need of logic is not felt, and accordingly the more\\r\\nthoroughgoing mystics do not employ logic, but appeal directly to the\\r\\nimmediate deliverance of their insight. but such fully developed\\r\\nmysticism is rare in the west. when the intensity of emotional\\r\\nconviction subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will\\r\\nsearch for logical grounds in favour of the belief which he finds in\\r\\nhimself. but since the belief already exists, he will be very\\r\\nhospitable to any ground that suggests itself. the paradoxes\\r\\napparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of mysticism,\\r\\nand are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is to be in\\r\\naccordance with insight. the resulting logic has rendered most\\r\\nphilosophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science\\r\\nand daily life. if they had been anxious to give such an account, they\\r\\nwould probably have discovered the errors of their logic; but most of\\r\\nthem were less anxious to understand the world of science and daily\\r\\nlife than to convict it of unreality in the interests of a\\r\\nsuper-sensible \"real\" world.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is in this way that logic has been pursued by those of the great\\r\\nphilosophers who were mystics. but since they usually took for granted\\r\\nthe supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines\\r\\nwere presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their\\r\\ndisciples to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from\\r\\nwhich they sprang. nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they\\r\\nremained--to borrow a useful word from mr. santayana--\"malicious\" in\\r\\nregard to the world of science and common sense. it is only so that we\\r\\ncan account for the complacency with which philosophers have accepted\\r\\nthe inconsistency of their doctrines with all the common and\\r\\nscientific facts which seem best established and most worthy of\\r\\nbelief.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are\\r\\ninherent in anything malicious. the impulse to logic, not felt while\\r\\nthe mystic mood is dominant, reasserts itself as the mood fades, but\\r\\nwith a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or at least to prove\\r\\nthat it _was_ insight, and that what seems to contradict it is\\r\\nillusion. the logic which thus arises is not quite disinterested or\\r\\ncandid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the daily world to\\r\\nwhich it is to be applied. such an attitude naturally does not tend to\\r\\nthe best results. everyone knows that to read an author simply in\\r\\norder to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to read the\\r\\nbook of nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is just as\\r\\nunlikely to lead to understanding. if our logic is to find the common\\r\\nworld intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired by a\\r\\ngenuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among\\r\\nmetaphysicians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niii. time\\r\\n\\r\\nthe unreality of time is a cardinal doctrine of many metaphysical\\r\\nsystems, often nominally based, as already by parmenides, upon logical\\r\\narguments, but originally derived, at any rate in the founders of new\\r\\nsystems, from the certainty which is born in the moment of mystic\\r\\ninsight. as a persian sufi poet says:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"past and future are what veil god from our sight.\\r\\n    burn up both of them with fire! how long\\r\\n    wilt thou be partitioned by these segments as a reed?\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe belief that what is ultimately real must be immutable is a very\\r\\ncommon one: it gave rise to the metaphysical notion of substance, and\\r\\nfinds, even now, a wholly illegitimate satisfaction in such scientific\\r\\ndoctrines as the conservation of energy and mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this view.\\r\\nthe arguments for the contention that time is unreal and that the\\r\\nworld of sense is illusory must, i think, be regarded as fallacious.\\r\\nnevertheless there is some sense--easier to feel than to state--in\\r\\nwhich time is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of\\r\\nreality. past and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the\\r\\npresent, and a certain emancipation from slavery to time is essential\\r\\nto philosophic thought. the importance of time is rather practical\\r\\nthan theoretical, rather in relation to our desires than in relation\\r\\nto truth. a truer image of the world, i think, is obtained by\\r\\npicturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal\\r\\nworld outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring\\r\\ntyrant of all that is. both in thought and in feeling, even though\\r\\ntime be real, to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of\\r\\nwisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat this is the case may be seen at once by asking ourselves why our\\r\\nfeelings towards the past are so different from our feelings towards\\r\\nthe future. the reason for this difference is wholly practical: our\\r\\nwishes can affect the future but not the past, the future is to some\\r\\nextent subject to our power, while the past is unalterably fixed. but\\r\\nevery future will some day be past: if we see the past truly now, it\\r\\nmust, when it was still future, have been just what we now see it to\\r\\nbe, and what is now future must be just what we shall see it to be\\r\\nwhen it has become past. the felt difference of quality between past\\r\\nand future, therefore, is not an intrinsic difference, but only a\\r\\ndifference in relation to us: to impartial contemplation, it ceases to\\r\\nexist. and impartiality of contemplation is, in the intellectual\\r\\nsphere, that very same virtue of disinterestedness which, in the\\r\\nsphere of action, appears as justice and unselfishness. whoever wishes\\r\\nto see the world truly, to rise in thought above the tyranny of\\r\\npractical desires, must learn to overcome the difference of attitude\\r\\ntowards past and future, and to survey the whole stream of time in one\\r\\ncomprehensive vision.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe kind of way in which, as it seems to me, time ought not to enter\\r\\ninto our theoretic philosophical thought, may be illustrated by the\\r\\nphilosophy which has become associated with the idea of evolution, and\\r\\nwhich is exemplified by nietzsche, pragmatism, and bergson. this\\r\\nphilosophy, on the basis of the development which has led from the\\r\\nlowest forms of life up to man, sees in _progress_ the fundamental law\\r\\nof the universe, and thus admits the difference between _earlier_ and\\r\\n_later_ into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook. with its\\r\\npast and future history of the world, conjectural as it is, i do not\\r\\nwish to quarrel. but i think that, in the intoxication of a quick\\r\\nsuccess, much that is required for a true understanding of the\\r\\nuniverse has been forgotten. something of hellenism, something, too,\\r\\nof oriental resignation, must be combined with its hurrying western\\r\\nself-assertion before it can emerge from the ardour of youth into the\\r\\nmature wisdom of manhood. in spite of its appeals to science, the true\\r\\nscientific philosophy, i think, is something more arduous and more\\r\\naloof, appealing to less mundane hopes, and requiring a severer\\r\\ndiscipline for its successful practice.\\r\\n\\r\\ndarwin\\'s _origin of species_ persuaded the world that the difference\\r\\nbetween different species of animals and plants is not the fixed\\r\\nimmutable difference that it appears to be. the doctrine of natural\\r\\nkinds, which had rendered classification easy and definite, which was\\r\\nenshrined in the aristotelian tradition, and protected by its supposed\\r\\nnecessity for orthodox dogma, was suddenly swept away for ever out of\\r\\nthe biological world. the difference between man and the lower\\r\\nanimals, which to our human conceit appears enormous, was shown to be\\r\\na gradual achievement, involving intermediate being who could not with\\r\\ncertainty be placed either within or without the human family. the sun\\r\\nand the planets had already been shown by laplace to be very probably\\r\\nderived from a primitive more or less undifferentiated nebula. thus\\r\\nthe old fixed landmarks became wavering and indistinct, and all sharp\\r\\noutlines were blurred. things and species lost their boundaries, and\\r\\nnone could say where they began or where they ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut if human conceit was staggered for a moment by its kinship with\\r\\nthe ape, it soon found a way to reassert itself, and that way is the\\r\\n\"philosophy\" of evolution. a process which led from the amba to man\\r\\nappeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress--though\\r\\nwhether the amba would agree with this opinion is not known. hence\\r\\nthe cycle of changes which science had shown to be the probable\\r\\nhistory of the past was welcomed as revealing a law of development\\r\\ntowards good in the universe--an evolution or unfolding of an idea\\r\\nslowly embodying itself in the actual. but such a view, though it\\r\\nmight satisfy spencer and those whom we may call hegelian\\r\\nevolutionists, could not be accepted as adequate by the more\\r\\nwhole-hearted votaries of change. an ideal to which the world\\r\\ncontinuously approaches is, to these minds, too dead and static to be\\r\\ninspiring. not only the aspiration, but the ideal too, must change and\\r\\ndevelop with the course of evolution: there must be no fixed goal, but\\r\\na continual fashioning of fresh needs by the impulse which is life and\\r\\nwhich alone gives unity to the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nlife, in this philosophy, is a continuous stream, in which all\\r\\ndivisions are artificial and unreal. separate things, beginnings and\\r\\nendings, are mere convenient fictions: there is only smooth unbroken\\r\\ntransition. the beliefs of to-day may count as true to-day, if they\\r\\ncarry us along the stream; but to-morrow they will be false, and must\\r\\nbe replaced by new beliefs to meet the new situation. all our thinking\\r\\nconsists of convenient fictions, imaginary congealings of the stream:\\r\\nreality flows on in spite of all our fictions, and though it can be\\r\\nlived, it cannot be conceived in thought. somehow, without explicit\\r\\nstatement, the assurance is slipped in that the future, though we\\r\\ncannot foresee it, will be better than the past or the present: the\\r\\nreader is like the child which expects a sweet because it has been\\r\\ntold to open its mouth and shut its eyes. logic, mathematics, physics\\r\\ndisappear in this philosophy, because they are too \"static\"; what is\\r\\nreal is no impulse and movement towards a goal which, like the\\r\\nrainbow, recedes as we advance, and makes every place different when\\r\\nit reaches it from what it appeared to be at a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not propose to enter upon a technical examination of this\\r\\nphilosophy. i wish only to maintain that the motives and interests\\r\\nwhich inspire it are so exclusively practical, and the problems with\\r\\nwhich it deals are so special, that it can hardly be regarded as\\r\\ntouching any of the questions that, to my mind, constitute genuine\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe predominant interest of evolutionism is in the question of human\\r\\ndestiny, or at least of the destiny of life. it is more interested in\\r\\nmorality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. it must be\\r\\nadmitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and\\r\\nthat a desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy can give is\\r\\nvery rare. but if philosophy is to attain truth, it is necessary first\\r\\nand foremost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested\\r\\nintellectual curiosity which characterises the genuine man of science.\\r\\nknowledge concerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that\\r\\nmust be sought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible\\r\\nwithin certain narrow limits. it is impossible to say how much the\\r\\nlimits may be enlarged with the progress of science. but what is\\r\\nevident is that any proposition about the future belongs by its\\r\\nsubject-matter to some particular science, and is to be ascertained,\\r\\nif at all, by the methods of that science. philosophy is not a short\\r\\ncut to the same kind of results as those of the other sciences: if it\\r\\nis to be a genuine study, it must have a province of its own, and aim\\r\\nat results which the other sciences can neither prove nor disprove.\\r\\n\\r\\nevolutionism, in basing itself upon the notion of _progress_, which is\\r\\nchange from the worse to the better, allows the notion of time, as it\\r\\nseems to me, to become its tyrant rather than its servant, and thereby\\r\\nloses that impartiality of contemplation which is the source of all\\r\\nthat is best in philosophic thought and feeling. metaphysicians, as we\\r\\nsaw, have frequently denied altogether the reality of time. i do not\\r\\nwish to do this; i wish only to preserve the mental outlook which\\r\\ninspired the denial, the attitude which, in thought, regards the past\\r\\nas having the same reality as the present and the same importance as\\r\\nthe future. \"in so far,\" says spinoza,[6] \"as the mind conceives a\\r\\nthing according to the dictate of reason, it will be equally affected\\r\\nwhether the idea is that of a future, past, or present thing.\" it is\\r\\nthis \"conceiving according to the dictate of reason\" that i find\\r\\nlacking in the philosophy which is based on evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niv. good and evil\\r\\n\\r\\nmysticism maintains that all evil is illusory, and sometimes maintains\\r\\nthe same view as regards good, but more often holds that all reality\\r\\nis good. both views are to be found in heraclitus: \"good and ill are\\r\\none,\" he says, but again, \"to god all things are fair and good and\\r\\nright, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\" a similar\\r\\ntwofold position is to be found in spinoza, but he uses the word\\r\\n\"perfection\" when he means to speak of the good that is not merely\\r\\nhuman. \"by reality and perfection i mean the same thing,\" he says;[7]\\r\\nbut elsewhere we find the definition: \"by _good_ i shall mean that\\r\\nwhich we certainly know to be useful to us.\"[8] thus perfection\\r\\nbelongs to reality in its own nature, but goodness is relative to\\r\\nourselves and our needs, and disappears in an impartial survey. some\\r\\nsuch distinction, i think, is necessary in order to understand the\\r\\nethical outlook of mysticism: there is a lower mundane kind of good\\r\\nand evil, which divides the world of appearance into what seem to be\\r\\nconflicting parts; but there is also a higher, mystical kind of good,\\r\\nwhich belongs to reality and is not opposed by any correlative kind of\\r\\nevil.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is difficult to give a logically tenable account of this position\\r\\nwithout recognising that good and evil are subjective, that what is\\r\\ngood is merely that towards which we have one kind of feeling, and\\r\\nwhat is evil is merely that towards which we have another kind of\\r\\nfeeling. in our active life, where we have to exercise choice, and to\\r\\nprefer this to that of two possible acts, it is necessary to have a\\r\\ndistinction of good and evil, or at least of better and worse. but\\r\\nthis distinction, like everything pertaining to action, belongs to\\r\\nwhat mysticism regards as the world of illusion, if only because it is\\r\\nessentially concerned with time. in our contemplative life, where\\r\\naction is not called for, it is possible to be impartial, and to\\r\\novercome the ethical dualism which action requires. so long as we\\r\\nremain _merely_ impartial, we may be content to say that both the good\\r\\nand the evil of action are illusions. but if, as we must do if we have\\r\\nthe mystic vision, we find the whole world worthy of love and worship,\\r\\nif we see\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"the earth, and every common sight....\\r\\n    apparell\\'d in celestial light,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall say that there is a higher good than that of action, and that\\r\\nthis higher good belongs to the whole world as it is in reality. in\\r\\nthis way the twofold attitude and the apparent vacillation of\\r\\nmysticism are explained and justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe possibility of this universal love and joy in all that exists is\\r\\nof supreme importance for the conduct and happiness of life, and gives\\r\\ninestimable value to the mystic emotion, apart from any creeds which\\r\\nmay be built upon it. but if we are not to be led into false beliefs,\\r\\nit is necessary to realise exactly _what_ the mystic emotion reveals.\\r\\nit reveals a possibility of human nature--a possibility of a nobler,\\r\\nhappier, freer life than any that can be otherwise achieved. but it\\r\\ndoes not reveal anything about the non-human, or about the nature of\\r\\nthe universe in general. good and bad, and even the higher good that\\r\\nmysticism finds everywhere, are the reflections of our own emotions on\\r\\nother things, not part of the substance of things as they are in\\r\\nthemselves. and therefore an impartial contemplation, freed from all\\r\\npre-occupation with self, will not judge things good or bad, although\\r\\nit is very easily combined with that feeling of universal love which\\r\\nleads the mystic to say that the whole world is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe philosophy of evolution, through the notion of progress, is bound\\r\\nup with the ethical dualism of the worse and the better, and is thus\\r\\nshut out, not only from the kind of survey which discards good and\\r\\nevil altogether from its view, but also from the mystical belief in\\r\\nthe goodness of everything. in this way the distinction of good and\\r\\nevil, like time, becomes a tyrant in this philosophy, and introduces\\r\\ninto thought the restless selectiveness of action. good and evil, like\\r\\ntime, are, it would seem, not general or fundamental in the world of\\r\\nthought, but late and highly specialised members of the intellectual\\r\\nhierarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough, as we saw, mysticism can be interpreted so as to agree with\\r\\nthe view that good and evil are not intellectually fundamental, it\\r\\nmust be admitted that here we are no longer in verbal agreement with\\r\\nmost of the great philosophers and religious teachers of the past. i\\r\\nbelieve, however, that the elimination of ethical considerations from\\r\\nphilosophy is both scientifically necessary and--though this may seem\\r\\na paradox--an ethical advance. both these contentions must be briefly\\r\\ndefended.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hope of satisfaction to our more human desires--the hope of\\r\\ndemonstrating that the world has this or that desirable ethical\\r\\ncharacteristic--is not one which, so far as i can see, a scientific\\r\\nphilosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. the difference between\\r\\na good world and a bad one is a difference in the particular\\r\\ncharacteristics of the particular things that exist in these worlds:\\r\\nit is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the\\r\\nprovince of philosophy. love and hate, for example, are ethical\\r\\nopposites, but to philosophy they are closely analogous attitudes\\r\\ntowards objects. the general form and structure of those attitudes\\r\\ntowards objects which constitute mental phenomena is a problem for\\r\\nphilosophy, but the difference between love and hate is not a\\r\\ndifference of form or structure, and therefore belongs rather to the\\r\\nspecial science of psychology than to philosophy. thus the ethical\\r\\ninterests which have often inspired philosophers must remain in the\\r\\nbackground: some kind of ethical interest may inspire the whole study,\\r\\nbut none must obtrude in the detail or be expected in the special\\r\\nresults which are sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nif this view seems at first sight disappointing, we may remind\\r\\nourselves that a similar change has been found necessary in all the\\r\\nother sciences. the physicist or chemist is not now required to prove\\r\\nthe ethical importance of his ions or atoms; the biologist is not\\r\\nexpected to prove the utility of the plants or animals which he\\r\\ndissects. in pre-scientific ages this was not the case. astronomy, for\\r\\nexample, was studied because men believed in astrology: it was thought\\r\\nthat the movements of the planets had the most direct and important\\r\\nbearing upon the lives of human beings. presumably, when this belief\\r\\ndecayed and the disinterested study of astronomy began, many who had\\r\\nfound astrology absorbingly interesting decided that astronomy had too\\r\\nlittle human interest to be worthy of study. physics, as it appears in\\r\\nplato\\'s timus for example, is full of ethical notions: it is an\\r\\nessential part of its purpose to show that the earth is worthy of\\r\\nadmiration. the modern physicist, on the contrary, though he has no\\r\\nwish to deny that the earth is admirable, is not concerned, as\\r\\nphysicist, with its ethical attributes: he is merely concerned to find\\r\\nout facts, not to consider whether they are good or bad. in\\r\\npsychology, the scientific attitude is even more recent and more\\r\\ndifficult than in the physical sciences: it is natural to consider\\r\\nthat human nature is either good or bad, and to suppose that the\\r\\ndifference between good and bad, so all-important in practice, must be\\r\\nimportant in theory also. it is only during the last century that an\\r\\nethically neutral psychology has grown up; and here too, ethical\\r\\nneutrality has been essential to scientific success.\\r\\n\\r\\nin philosophy, hitherto, ethical neutrality has been seldom sought and\\r\\nhardly ever achieved. men have remembered their wishes, and have\\r\\njudged philosophies in relation to their wishes. driven from the\\r\\nparticular sciences, the belief that the notions of good and evil must\\r\\nafford a key to the understanding of the world has sought a refuge in\\r\\nphilosophy. but even from this last refuge, if philosophy is not to\\r\\nremain a set of pleasing dreams, this belief must be driven forth. it\\r\\nis a commonplace that happiness is not best achieved by those who\\r\\nseek it directly; and it would seem that the same is true of the good.\\r\\nin thought, at any rate, those who forget good and evil and seek only\\r\\nto know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view\\r\\nthe world through the distorting medium of their own desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are thus brought back to our seeming paradox, that a philosophy\\r\\nwhich does not seek to impose upon the world its own conceptions of\\r\\ngood and evil is not only more likely to achieve truth, but is also\\r\\nthe outcome of a higher ethical standpoint than one which, like\\r\\nevolutionism and most traditional systems, is perpetually appraising\\r\\nthe universe and seeking to find in it an embodiment of present\\r\\nideals. in religion, and in every deeply serious view of the world and\\r\\nof human destiny, there is an element of submission, a realisation of\\r\\nthe limits of human power, which is somewhat lacking in the modern\\r\\nworld, with its quick material successes and its insolent belief in\\r\\nthe boundless possibilities of progress. \"he that loveth his life\\r\\nshall lose it\"; and there is danger lest, through a too confident love\\r\\nof life, life itself should lose much of what gives it its highest\\r\\nworth. the submission which religion inculcates in action is\\r\\nessentially the same in spirit as that which science teaches in\\r\\nthought; and the ethical neutrality by which its victories have been\\r\\nachieved is the outcome of that submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe good which it concerns us to remember is the good which it lies in\\r\\nour power to create--the good in our own lives and in our attitude\\r\\ntowards the world. insistence on belief in an external realisation of\\r\\nthe good is a form of self-assertion, which, while it cannot secure\\r\\nthe external good which it desires, can seriously impair the inward\\r\\ngood which lies within our power, and destroy that reverence towards\\r\\nfact which constitutes both what is valuable in humility and what is\\r\\nfruitful in the scientific temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nhuman beings cannot, of course, wholly transcend human nature;\\r\\nsomething subjective, if only the interest that determines the\\r\\ndirection of our attention, must remain in all our thought. but\\r\\nscientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human\\r\\npursuit, and gives us, therefore, the closest constant and the most\\r\\nintimate relation with the outer world that it is possible to achieve.\\r\\nto the primitive mind, everything is either friendly or hostile; but\\r\\nexperience has shown that friendliness and hostility are not the\\r\\nconceptions by which the world is to be understood. scientific\\r\\nphilosophy thus represents, though as yet only in a nascent condition,\\r\\na higher form of thought than any pre-scientific belief or\\r\\nimagination, and, like every approach to self-transcendence, it brings\\r\\nwith it a rich reward in increase of scope and breadth and\\r\\ncomprehension. evolutionism, in spite of its appeals to particular\\r\\nscientific facts, fails to be a truly scientific philosophy because of\\r\\nits slavery to time, its ethical preoccupations, and its predominant\\r\\ninterest in our mundane concerns and destiny. a truly scientific\\r\\nphilosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering\\r\\nless glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more\\r\\nindifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without\\r\\nthe tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] all the above quotations are from burnet\\'s _early greek\\r\\nphilosophy_, (2nd ed., 1908), pp. 146-156.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] _republic_, 514, translated by

selection of sensational triumphs, such as wireless telegraphy\\r\\nand aeroplanes, radio-activity and the marvels of modern alchemy. it is\\r\\nnot of this aspect of science that i wish to speak. science, in this\\r\\naspect, consists of detached up-to-date fragments, interesting only\\r\\nuntil they are replaced by something newer and more up-to-date,\\r\\ndisplaying nothing of the systems of patiently constructed knowledge\\r\\nout of which, almost as a casual incident, have come the practically\\r\\nuseful results which interest the man in the street. the increased\\r\\ncommand over the forces of nature which is derived from science is\\r\\nundoubtedly an amply sufficient reason for encouraging scientific\\r\\nresearch, but this reason has been so often urged and is so easily\\r\\nappreciated that other reasons, to my mind quite as important, are apt\\r\\nto be overlooked. it is with these other reasons, especially with the\\r\\nintrinsic value of a scientific habit of mind in forming our outlook\\r\\non the world, that i shall be concerned in what follows.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe instance of wireless telegraphy will serve to illustrate the\\r\\ndifference between the two points of view. almost all the serious\\r\\nintellectual labour required for the possibility of this invention is\\r\\ndue to three men--faraday, maxwell, and hertz. in alternating layers\\r\\nof experiment and theory these three men built up the modern theory of\\r\\nelectromagnetism, and demonstrated the identity of light with\\r\\nelectromagnetic waves. the system which they discovered is one of\\r\\nprofound intellectual interest, bringing together and unifying an\\r\\nendless variety of apparently detached phenomena, and displaying a\\r\\ncumulative mental power which cannot but afford delight to every\\r\\ngenerous spirit. the mechanical details which remained to be adjusted\\r\\nin order to utilise their discoveries for a practical system of\\r\\ntelegraphy demanded, no doubt, very considerable ingenuity, but had\\r\\nnot that broad sweep and that universality which could give them\\r\\nintrinsic interest as an object of disinterested contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the point of view of training the mind, of giving that\\r\\nwell-informed, impersonal outlook which constitutes culture in the\\r\\ngood sense of this much-misused word, it seems to be generally held\\r\\nindisputable that a literary education is superior to one based on\\r\\nscience. even the warmest advocates of science are apt to rest their\\r\\nclaims on the contention that culture ought to be sacrificed to\\r\\nutility. those men of science who respect culture, when they associate\\r\\nwith men learned in the classics, are apt to admit, not merely\\r\\npolitely, but sincerely, a certain inferiority on their side,\\r\\ncompensated doubtless by the services which science renders to\\r\\nhumanity, but none the less real. and so long as this attitude exists\\r\\namong men of science, it tends to verify itself: the intrinsically\\r\\nvaluable aspects of science tend to be sacrificed to the merely\\r\\nuseful, and little attempt is made to preserve that leisurely,\\r\\nsystematic survey by which the finer quality of mind is formed and\\r\\nnourished.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut even if there be, in present fact, any such inferiority as is\\r\\nsupposed in the educational value of science, this is, i believe, not\\r\\nthe fault of science itself, but the fault of the spirit in which\\r\\nscience is taught. if its full possibilities were realised by those\\r\\nwho teach it, i believe that its capacity of producing those habits of\\r\\nmind which constitute the highest mental excellence would be at least\\r\\nas great as that of literature, and more particularly of greek and\\r\\nlatin literature. in saying this i have no wish whatever to disparage\\r\\na classical education. i have not myself enjoyed its benefits, and my\\r\\nknowledge of greek and latin authors is derived almost wholly from\\r\\ntranslations. but i am firmly persuaded that the greeks fully deserve\\r\\nall the admiration that is bestowed upon them, and that it is a very\\r\\ngreat and serious loss to be unacquainted with their writings. it is\\r\\nnot by attacking them, but by drawing attention to neglected\\r\\nexcellences in science, that i wish to conduct my argument.\\r\\n\\r\\none defect, however, does seem inherent in a purely classical\\r\\neducation--namely, a too exclusive emphasis on the past. by the study\\r\\nof what is absolutely ended and can never be renewed, a habit of\\r\\ncriticism towards the present and the future is engendered. the\\r\\nqualities in which the present excels are qualities to which the study\\r\\nof the past does not direct attention, and to which, therefore, the\\r\\nstudent of greek civilisation may easily become blind. in what is new\\r\\nand growing there is apt to be something crude, insolent, even a\\r\\nlittle vulgar, which is shocking to the man of sensitive taste;\\r\\nquivering from the rough contact, he retires to the trim gardens of a\\r\\npolished past, forgetting that they were reclaimed from the wilderness\\r\\nby men as rough and earth-soiled as those from whom he shrinks in his\\r\\nown day. the habit of being unable to recognise merit until it is\\r\\ndead is too apt to be the result of a purely bookish life, and a\\r\\nculture based wholly on the past will seldom be able to pierce through\\r\\neveryday surroundings to the essential splendour of contemporary\\r\\nthings, or to the hope of still greater splendour in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"my eyes saw not the men of old;\\r\\n    and now their age away has rolled.\\r\\n    i weep--to think i shall not see\\r\\n    the heroes of posterity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nso says the chinese poet; but such impartiality is rare in the more\\r\\npugnacious atmosphere of the west, where the champions of past and\\r\\nfuture fight a never-ending battle, instead of combining to seek out\\r\\nthe merits of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis consideration, which militates not only against the exclusive\\r\\nstudy of the classics, but against every form of culture which has\\r\\nbecome static, traditional, and academic, leads inevitably to the\\r\\nfundamental question: what is the true end of education? but before\\r\\nattempting to answer this question it will be well to define the sense\\r\\nin which we are to use the word \"education.\" for this purpose i shall\\r\\ndistinguish the sense in which i mean to use it from two others, both\\r\\nperfectly legitimate, the one broader and the other narrower than the\\r\\nsense in which i mean to use the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the broader sense, education will include not only what we learn\\r\\nthrough instruction, but all that we learn through personal\\r\\nexperience--the formation of character through the education of life.\\r\\nof this aspect of education, vitally important as it is, i will say\\r\\nnothing, since its consideration would introduce topics quite foreign\\r\\nto the question with which we are concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the narrower sense, education may be confined to instruction, the\\r\\nimparting of definite information on various subjects, because such\\r\\ninformation, in and for itself, is useful in daily life. elementary\\r\\neducation--reading, writing, and arithmetic--is almost wholly of this\\r\\nkind. but instruction, necessary as it is, does not _per se_\\r\\nconstitute education in the sense in which i wish to consider it.\\r\\n\\r\\neducation, in the sense in which i mean it, may be defined as _the\\r\\nformation, by means of instruction, of certain mental habits and a\\r\\ncertain outlook on life and the world_. it remains to ask ourselves,\\r\\nwhat mental habits, and what sort of outlook, can be hoped for as the\\r\\nresult of instruction? when we have answered this question we can\\r\\nattempt to decide what science has to contribute to the formation of\\r\\nthe habits and outlook which we desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nour whole life is built about a certain number--not a very small\\r\\nnumber--of primary instincts and impulses. only what is in some way\\r\\nconnected with these instincts and impulses appears to us desirable or\\r\\nimportant; there is no faculty, whether \"reason\" or \"virtue\" or\\r\\nwhatever it may be called, that can take our active life and our hopes\\r\\nand fears outside the region controlled by these first movers of all\\r\\ndesire. each of them is like a queen-bee, aided by a hive of workers\\r\\ngathering honey; but when the queen is gone the workers languish and\\r\\ndie, and the cells remain empty of their expected sweetness. so with\\r\\neach primary impulse in civilised man: it is surrounded and protected\\r\\nby a busy swarm of attendant derivative desires, which store up in its\\r\\nservice whatever honey the surrounding world affords. but if the\\r\\nqueen-impulse dies, the death-dealing influence, though retarded a\\r\\nlittle by habit, spreads slowly through all the subsidiary impulses,\\r\\nand a whole tract of life becomes inexplicably colourless. what was\\r\\nformerly full of zest, and so obviously worth doing that it raised no\\r\\nquestions, has now grown dreary and purposeless: with a sense of\\r\\ndisillusion we inquire the meaning of life, and decide, perhaps, that\\r\\nall is vanity. the search for an outside meaning that can _compel_ an\\r\\ninner response must always be disappointed: all \"meaning\" must be at\\r\\nbottom related to our primary desires, and when they are extinct no\\r\\nmiracle can restore to the world the value which they reflected upon\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe purpose of education, therefore, cannot be to create any primary\\r\\nimpulse which is lacking in the uneducated; the purpose can only be to\\r\\nenlarge the scope of those that human nature provides, by increasing\\r\\nthe number and variety of attendant thoughts, and by showing where the\\r\\nmost permanent satisfaction is to be found. under the impulse of a\\r\\ncalvinistic horror of the \"natural man,\" this obvious truth has been\\r\\ntoo often misconceived in the training of the young; \"nature\" has been\\r\\nfalsely regarded as excluding all that is best in what is natural, and\\r\\nthe endeavour to teach virtue has led to the production of stunted and\\r\\ncontorted hypocrites instead of full-grown human beings. from such\\r\\nmistakes in education a better psychology or a kinder heart is\\r\\nbeginning to preserve the present generation; we need, therefore,\\r\\nwaste no more words on the theory that the purpose of education is to\\r\\nthwart or eradicate nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut although nature must supply the initial force of desire, nature is\\r\\nnot, in the civilised man, the spasmodic, fragmentary, and yet violent\\r\\nset of impulses that it is in the savage. each impulse has its\\r\\nconstitutional ministry of thought and knowledge and reflection,\\r\\nthrough which possible conflicts of impulses are foreseen, and\\r\\ntemporary impulses are controlled by the unifying impulse which may be\\r\\ncalled wisdom. in this way education destroys the crudity of\\r\\ninstinct, and increases through knowledge the wealth and variety of\\r\\nthe individual\\'s contacts with the outside world, making him no longer\\r\\nan isolated fighting unit, but a citizen of the universe, embracing\\r\\ndistant countries, remote regions of space, and vast stretches of past\\r\\nand future within the circle of his interests. it is this simultaneous\\r\\nsoftening in the insistence of desire and enlargement of its scope\\r\\nthat is the chief moral end of education.\\r\\n\\r\\nclosely connected with this moral end is the more purely intellectual\\r\\naim of education, the endeavour to make us see and imagine the world\\r\\nin an objective manner, as far as possible as it is in itself, and not\\r\\nmerely through the distorting medium of personal desire. the complete\\r\\nattainment of such an objective view is no doubt an ideal,\\r\\nindefinitely approachable, but not actually and fully realisable.\\r\\neducation, considered as a process of forming our mental habits and\\r\\nour outlook on the world, is to be judged successful in proportion as\\r\\nits outcome approximates to this ideal; in proportion, that is to say,\\r\\nas it gives us a true view of our place in society, of the relation of\\r\\nthe whole human society to its non-human environment, and of the\\r\\nnature of the non-human world as it is in itself apart from our\\r\\ndesires and interests. if this standard is admitted, we can return to\\r\\nthe consideration of science, inquiring how far science contributes to\\r\\nsuch an aim, and whether it is in any respect superior to its rivals\\r\\nin educational practice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nii\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo opposite and at first sight conflicting merits belong to science\\r\\nas against literature and art. the one, which is not inherently\\r\\nnecessary, but is certainly true at the present day, is hopefulness\\r\\nas to the future of human achievement, and in particular as to the\\r\\nuseful work that may be accomplished by any intelligent student. this\\r\\nmerit and the cheerful outlook which it engenders prevent what might\\r\\notherwise be the depressing effect of another aspect of science, to my\\r\\nmind also a merit, and perhaps its greatest merit--i mean the\\r\\nirrelevance of human passions and of the whole subjective apparatus\\r\\nwhere scientific truth is concerned. each of these reasons for\\r\\npreferring the study of science requires some amplification. let us\\r\\nbegin with the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the study of literature or art our attention is perpetually riveted\\r\\nupon the past: the men of greece or of the renaissance did better than\\r\\nany men do now; the triumphs of former ages, so far from facilitating\\r\\nfresh triumphs in our own age, actually increase the difficulty of\\r\\nfresh triumphs by rendering originality harder of attainment; not only\\r\\nis artistic achievement not cumulative, but it seems even to depend\\r\\nupon a certain freshness and _navet_ of impulse and vision which\\r\\ncivilisation tends to destroy. hence comes, to those who have been\\r\\nnourished on the literary and artistic productions of former ages, a\\r\\ncertain peevishness and undue fastidiousness towards the present, from\\r\\nwhich there seems no escape except into the deliberate vandalism which\\r\\nignores tradition and in the search after originality achieves only\\r\\nthe eccentric. but in such vandalism there is none of the simplicity\\r\\nand spontaneity out of which great art springs: theory is still the\\r\\ncanker in its core, and insincerity destroys the advantages of a\\r\\nmerely pretended ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe despair thus arising from an education which suggests no\\r\\npre-eminent mental activity except that of artistic creation is wholly\\r\\nabsent from an education which gives the knowledge of scientific\\r\\nmethod. the discovery of scientific method, except in pure\\r\\nmathematics, is a thing of yesterday; speaking broadly, we may say\\r\\nthat it dates from galileo. yet already it has transformed the world,\\r\\nand its success proceeds with ever-accelerating velocity. in science\\r\\nmen have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which\\r\\nthey are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the\\r\\nappearance of continually greater genius, for in science the\\r\\nsuccessors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one\\r\\nman of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can\\r\\napply it. no transcendent ability is required in order to make useful\\r\\ndiscoveries in science; the edifice of science needs its masons,\\r\\nbricklayers, and common labourers as well as its foremen,\\r\\nmaster-builders, and architects. in art nothing worth doing can be\\r\\ndone without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can\\r\\ncontribute to a supreme achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nin science the man of real genius is the man who invents a new method.\\r\\nthe notable discoveries are often made by his successors, who can\\r\\napply the method with fresh vigour, unimpaired by the previous labour\\r\\nof perfecting it; but the mental calibre of the thought required for\\r\\ntheir work, however brilliant, is not so great as that required by the\\r\\nfirst inventor of the method. there are in science immense numbers of\\r\\ndifferent methods, appropriate to different classes of problems; but\\r\\nover and above them all, there is something not easily definable,\\r\\nwhich may be called _the_ method of science. it was formerly customary\\r\\nto identify this with the inductive method, and to associate it with\\r\\nthe name of bacon. but the true inductive method was not discovered by\\r\\nbacon, and the true method of science is something which includes\\r\\ndeduction as much as induction, logic and mathematics as much as\\r\\nbotany and geology. i shall not attempt the difficult task of stating\\r\\nwhat the scientific method is, but i will try to indicate the temper\\r\\nof mind out of which the scientific method grows, which is the second\\r\\nof the two merits that were mentioned above as belonging to a\\r\\nscientific education.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe kernel of the scientific outlook is a thing so simple, so obvious,\\r\\nso seemingly trivial, that the mention of it may almost excite\\r\\nderision. the kernel of the scientific outlook is the refusal to\\r\\nregard our own desires, tastes, and interests as affording a key to\\r\\nthe understanding of the world. stated thus baldly, this may seem no\\r\\nmore than a trite truism. but to remember it consistently in matters\\r\\narousing our passionate partisanship is by no means easy, especially\\r\\nwhere the available evidence is uncertain and inconclusive. a few\\r\\nillustrations will make this clear.\\r\\n\\r\\naristotle, i understand, considered that the stars must move in\\r\\ncircles because the circle is the most perfect curve. in the absence\\r\\nof evidence to the contrary, he allowed himself to decide a question\\r\\nof fact by an appeal to sthetico-moral considerations. in such a case\\r\\nit is at once obvious to us that this appeal was unjustifiable. we\\r\\nknow now how to ascertain as a fact the way in which the heavenly\\r\\nbodies move, and we know that they do not move in circles, or even in\\r\\naccurate ellipses, or in any other kind of simply describable curve.\\r\\nthis may be painful to a certain hankering after simplicity of pattern\\r\\nin the universe, but we know that in astronomy such feelings are\\r\\nirrelevant. easy as this knowledge seems now, we owe it to the courage\\r\\nand insight of the first inventors of scientific method, and more\\r\\nespecially of galileo.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may take as another illustration malthus\\'s doctrine of population.\\r\\nthis illustration is all the better for the fact that his actual\\r\\ndoctrine is now known to be largely erroneous. it is not his\\r\\nconclusions that are valuable, but the temper and method of his\\r\\ninquiry. as everyone knows, it was to him that darwin owed an\\r\\nessential part of his theory of natural selection, and this was only\\r\\npossible because malthus\\'s outlook was truly scientific. his great\\r\\nmerit lies in considering man not as the object of praise or blame,\\r\\nbut as a part of nature, a thing with a certain characteristic\\r\\nbehaviour from which certain consequences must follow. if the\\r\\nbehaviour is not quite what malthus supposed, if the consequences are\\r\\nnot quite what he inferred, that may falsify his conclusions, but does\\r\\nnot impair the value of his method. the objections which were made\\r\\nwhen his doctrine was new--that it was horrible and depressing, that\\r\\npeople ought not to act as he said they did, and so on--were all such\\r\\nas implied an unscientific attitude of mind; as against all of them,\\r\\nhis calm determination to treat man as a natural phenomenon marks an\\r\\nimportant advance over the reformers of the eighteenth century and the\\r\\nrevolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nunder the influence of darwinism the scientific attitude towards man\\r\\nhas now become fairly common, and is to some people quite natural,\\r\\nthough to most it is still a difficult and artificial intellectual\\r\\ncontortion. there is however, one study which is as yet almost wholly\\r\\nuntouched by the scientific spirit--i mean the study of philosophy.\\r\\nphilosophers and the public imagine that the scientific spirit must\\r\\npervade pages that bristle with allusions to ions, germ-plasms, and\\r\\nthe eyes of shell-fish. but as the devil can quote scripture, so the\\r\\nphilosopher can quote science. the scientific spirit is not an affair\\r\\nof quotation, of externally acquired information, any more than\\r\\nmanners are an affair of the etiquette-book. the scientific attitude\\r\\nof mind involves a sweeping away of all other desires in the interests\\r\\nof the desire to know--it involves suppression of hopes and fears,\\r\\nloves and hates, and the whole subjective emotional life, until we\\r\\nbecome subdued to the material, able to see it frankly, without\\r\\npreconceptions, without bias, without any wish except to see it as it\\r\\nis, and without any belief that what it is must be determined by some\\r\\nrelation, positive or negative, to what we should like it to be, or to\\r\\nwhat we can easily imagine it to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow in philosophy this attitude of mind has not as yet been achieved.\\r\\na certain self-absorption, not personal, but human, has marked almost\\r\\nall attempts to conceive the universe as a whole. mind, or some aspect\\r\\nof it--thought or will or sentience--has been regarded as the pattern\\r\\nafter which the universe is to be conceived, for no better reason, at\\r\\nbottom, than that such a universe would not seem strange, and would\\r\\ngive us the cosy feeling that every place is like home. to conceive\\r\\nthe universe as essentially progressive or essentially deteriorating,\\r\\nfor example, is to give to our hopes and fears a cosmic importance\\r\\nwhich _may_, of course, be justified, but which we have as yet no\\r\\nreason to suppose justified. until we have learnt to think of it in\\r\\nethically neutral terms, we have not arrived at a scientific attitude\\r\\nin philosophy; and until we have arrived at such an attitude, it is\\r\\nhardly to be hoped that philosophy will achieve any solid results.\\r\\n\\r\\ni have spoken so far largely of the negative aspect of the scientific\\r\\nspirit, but it is from the positive aspect that its value is derived.\\r\\nthe instinct of constructiveness, which is one of the chief incentives\\r\\nto artistic creation, can find in scientific systems a satisfaction\\r\\nmore massive than any epic poem. disinterested curiosity, which is the\\r\\nsource of almost all intellectual effort, finds with astonished\\r\\ndelight that science can unveil secrets which might well have seemed\\r\\nfor ever undiscoverable. the desire for a larger life and wider\\r\\ninterests, for an escape from private circumstances, and even from the\\r\\nwhole recurring human cycle of birth and death, is fulfilled by the\\r\\nimpersonal cosmic outlook of science as by nothing else. to all these\\r\\nmust be added, as contributing to the happiness of the man of science,\\r\\nthe admiration of splendid achievement, and the consciousness of\\r\\ninestimable utility to the human race. a life devoted to science is\\r\\ntherefore a happy life, and its happiness is derived from the very\\r\\nbest sources that are open to dwellers on this troubled and passionate\\r\\nplanet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niii\\r\\n\\r\\na free man\\'s worship[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nto dr. faustus in his study mephistopheles told the history of the\\r\\ncreation, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow\\r\\nwearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? had he not\\r\\ngiven them endless joy? would it not be more amusing to obtain\\r\\nundeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured? he\\r\\nsmiled inwardly, and resolved that the great drama should be\\r\\nperformed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"for countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. at\\r\\nlength it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the\\r\\nplanets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed,\\r\\nfrom black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid\\r\\ncrust. and now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean,\\r\\nand developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest\\r\\ntrees, huge ferns springing from the damp mould, sea monsters\\r\\nbreeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. and from the\\r\\nmonsters, as the play unfolded itself, man was born, with the power of\\r\\nthought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for\\r\\nworship. and man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world,\\r\\nthat all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of\\r\\nlife before death\\'s inexorable decree. and man said: \\'there is a\\r\\nhidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for\\r\\nwe must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing\\r\\nworthy of reverence.\\' and man stood aside from the struggle, resolving\\r\\nthat god intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. and\\r\\nwhen he followed the instincts which god had transmitted to him from\\r\\nhis ancestry of beasts of prey, he called it sin, and asked god to\\r\\nforgive him. but he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until\\r\\nhe invented a divine plan by which god\\'s wrath was to have been\\r\\nappeased. and seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that\\r\\nthereby the future might be better. and he gave god thanks for the\\r\\nstrength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible.\\r\\nand god smiled; and when he saw that man had become perfect in\\r\\nrenunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which\\r\\ncrashed into man\\'s sun; and all returned again to nebula.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'yes,\\' he murmured, \\'it was a good play; i will have it performed\\r\\nagain.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch, in outline, but even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is\\r\\nthe world which science presents for our belief. amid such a world, if\\r\\nanywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. that man is the\\r\\nproduct of causes which had no prevision of the end they were\\r\\nachieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves\\r\\nand his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of\\r\\natoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling,\\r\\ncan preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours\\r\\nof the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday\\r\\nbrightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast\\r\\ndeath of the solar system, and that the whole temple of man\\'s\\r\\nachievement must inevitably be buried beneath the dbris of a universe\\r\\nin ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so\\r\\nnearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to\\r\\nstand. only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm\\r\\nfoundation of unyielding despair, can the soul\\'s habitation henceforth\\r\\nbe safely built.\\r\\n\\r\\nhow, in such an alien and inhuman world, can so powerless a creature\\r\\nas man preserve his aspirations untarnished? a strange mystery it is\\r\\nthat nature, omnipotent but blind, in the revolutions of her secular\\r\\nhurryings through the abysses of space, has brought forth at last a\\r\\nchild, subject still to her power, but gifted with sight, with\\r\\nknowledge of good and evil, with the capacity of judging all the works\\r\\nof his unthinking mother. in spite of death, the mark and seal of the\\r\\nparental control, man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine,\\r\\nto criticise, to know, and in imagination to create. to him alone, in\\r\\nthe world with which he is acquainted, this freedom belongs; and in\\r\\nthis lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his\\r\\noutward life.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe savage, like ourselves, feels the oppression of his impotence\\r\\nbefore the powers of nature; but having in himself nothing that he\\r\\nrespects more than power, he is willing to prostrate himself before\\r\\nhis gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship.\\r\\npathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture,\\r\\nof degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating\\r\\nthe jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is\\r\\nmost precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be\\r\\nappeased, and more will not be required. the religion of moloch--as\\r\\nsuch creeds may be generically called--is in essence the cringing\\r\\nsubmission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the\\r\\nthought that his master deserves no adulation. since the independence\\r\\nof ideals is not yet acknowledged, power may be freely worshipped, and\\r\\nreceive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut gradually, as morality grows bolder, the claim of the ideal world\\r\\nbegins to be felt; and worship, if it is not to cease, must be given\\r\\nto gods of another kind than those created by the savage. some, though\\r\\nthey feel the demands of the ideal, will still consciously reject\\r\\nthem, still urging that naked power is worthy of worship. such is the\\r\\nattitude inculcated in god\\'s answer to job out of the whirlwind: the\\r\\ndivine power and knowledge are paraded, but of the divine goodness\\r\\nthere is no hint. such also is the attitude of those who, in our own\\r\\nday, base their morality upon the struggle for survival, maintaining\\r\\nthat the survivors are necessarily the fittest. but others, not\\r\\ncontent with an answer so repugnant to the moral sense, will adopt the\\r\\nposition which we have become accustomed to regard as specially\\r\\nreligious, maintaining that, in some hidden manner, the world of fact\\r\\nis really harmonious with the world of ideals. thus man creates god,\\r\\nall-powerful and all-good, the mystic unity of what is and what should\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the world of fact, after all, is not good; and, in submitting our\\r\\njudgment to it, there is an element of slavishness from which our\\r\\nthoughts must be purged. for in all things it is well to exalt the\\r\\ndignity of man, by freeing him as far as possible from the tyranny of\\r\\nnon-human power. when we have realised that power is largely bad, that\\r\\nman, with his knowledge of good and evil, is but a helpless atom in a\\r\\nworld which has no such knowledge, the choice is again presented to\\r\\nus: shall we worship force, or shall we worship goodness? shall our\\r\\ngod exist and be evil, or shall he be recognised as the creation of\\r\\nour own conscience?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe answer to this question is very momentous, and affects profoundly\\r\\nour whole morality. the worship of force, to which carlyle and\\r\\nnietzsche and the creed of militarism have accustomed us, is the\\r\\nresult of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile\\r\\nuniverse: it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of\\r\\nour best to moloch. if strength indeed is to be respected, let us\\r\\nrespect rather the strength of those who refuse that false\\r\\n\"recognition of facts\" which fails to recognise that facts are often\\r\\nbad. let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things\\r\\nthat would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and\\r\\nmust adhere are not realised in the realm of matter. let us preserve\\r\\nour respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which\\r\\nlife does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meet\\r\\nwith the approval of the unconscious universe. if power is bad, as it\\r\\nseems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. in this lies man\\'s true\\r\\nfreedom: in determination to worship only the god created by our own\\r\\nlove of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the\\r\\ninsight of our best moments. in action, in desire, we must submit\\r\\nperpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in\\r\\naspiration, we are free, free from our fellow-men, free from the petty\\r\\nplanet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live,\\r\\nfrom the tyranny of death. let us learn, then, that energy of faith\\r\\nwhich enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let\\r\\nus descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always\\r\\nbefore us.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen first the opposition of fact and ideal grows fully visible, a\\r\\nspirit of fiery revolt, of fierce hatred of the gods, seems necessary\\r\\nto the assertion of freedom. to defy with promethean constancy a\\r\\nhostile universe, to keep its evil always in view, always actively\\r\\nhated, to refuse no pain that the malice of power can invent, appears\\r\\nto be the duty of all who will not bow before the inevitable. but\\r\\nindignation is still a bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be\\r\\noccupied with an evil world; and in the fierceness of desire from\\r\\nwhich rebellion springs there is a kind of self-assertion which it is\\r\\nnecessary for the wise to overcome. indignation is a submission of our\\r\\nthoughts, but not of our desires; the stoic freedom in which wisdom\\r\\nconsists is found in the submission of our desires, but not of our\\r\\nthoughts. from the submission of our desires springs the virtue of\\r\\nresignation; from the freedom of our thoughts springs the whole world\\r\\nof art and philosophy, and the vision of beauty by which, at last, we\\r\\nhalf reconquer the reluctant world. but the vision of beauty is\\r\\npossible only to unfettered contemplation, to thoughts not weighted by\\r\\nthe load of eager wishes; and thus freedom comes only to those who no\\r\\nlonger ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal\\r\\ngoods that are subject to the mutations of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough the necessity of renunciation is evidence of the existence of\\r\\nevil, yet christianity, in preaching it, has shown a wisdom exceeding\\r\\nthat of the promethean philosophy of rebellion. it must be admitted\\r\\nthat, of the things we desire, some, though they prove impossible, are\\r\\nyet real goods; others, however, as ardently longed for, do not form\\r\\npart of a fully purified ideal. the belief that what must be renounced\\r\\nis bad, though sometimes false, is far less often false than untamed\\r\\npassion supposes; and the creed of religion, by providing a reason\\r\\nfor proving that it is never false, has been the means of purifying\\r\\nour hopes by the discovery of many austere truths.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there is in resignation a further good element: even real goods,\\r\\nwhen they are unattainable, ought not to be fretfully desired. to\\r\\nevery man comes, sooner or later, the great renunciation. for the\\r\\nyoung, there is nothing unattainable; a good thing desired with the\\r\\nwhole force of a passionate will, and yet impossible, is to them not\\r\\ncredible. yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of\\r\\nduty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for\\r\\nus, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, fate may\\r\\nnevertheless forbid them. it is the part of courage, when misfortune\\r\\ncomes, to bear without repining the ruin of our hopes, to turn away\\r\\nour thoughts from vain regrets. this degree of submission to power is\\r\\nnot only just and right: it is the very gate of wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut passive renunciation is not the whole of wisdom; for not by\\r\\nrenunciation alone can we build a temple for the worship of our own\\r\\nideals. haunting foreshadowings of the temple appear in the realm of\\r\\nimagination, in music, in architecture, in the untroubled kingdom of\\r\\nreason, and in the golden sunset magic of lyrics, where beauty shines\\r\\nand glows, remote from the touch of sorrow, remote from the fear of\\r\\nchange, remote from the failures and disenchantments of the world of\\r\\nfact. in the contemplation of these things the vision of heaven will\\r\\nshape itself in our hearts, giving at once a touchstone to judge the\\r\\nworld about us, and an inspiration by which to fashion to our needs\\r\\nwhatever is not incapable of serving as a stone in the sacred temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nexcept for those rare spirits that are born without sin, there is a\\r\\ncavern of darkness to be traversed before that temple can be entered.\\r\\nthe gate of the cavern is despair, and its floor is paved with the\\r\\ngravestones of abandoned hopes. there self must die; there the\\r\\neagerness, the greed of untamed desire must be slain, for only so can\\r\\nthe soul be freed from the empire of fate. but out of the cavern the\\r\\ngate of renunciation leads again to the daylight of wisdom, by whose\\r\\nradiance a new insight, a new joy, a new tenderness, shine forth to\\r\\ngladden the pilgrim\\'s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen, without the bitterness of impotent rebellion, we have learnt\\r\\nboth to resign ourselves to the outward rule of fate and to recognise\\r\\nthat the non-human world is unworthy of our worship, it becomes\\r\\npossible at last so to transform and refashion the unconscious\\r\\nuniverse, so to transmute it in the crucible of imagination, that a\\r\\nnew image of shining gold replaces the old idol of clay. in all the\\r\\nmultiform facts of the world--in the visual shapes of trees and\\r\\nmountains and clouds, in the events of the life of man, even in the\\r\\nvery omnipotence of death--the insight of creative idealism can find\\r\\nthe reflection of a beauty which its own thoughts first made. in this\\r\\nway mind asserts its subtle mastery over the thoughtless forces of\\r\\nnature. the more evil the material with which it deals, the more\\r\\nthwarting to untrained desire, the greater is its achievement in\\r\\ninducing the reluctant rock to yield up its hidden treasures, the\\r\\nprouder its victory in compelling the opposing forces to swell the\\r\\npageant of its triumph. of all the arts, tragedy is the proudest, the\\r\\nmost triumphant; for it builds its shining citadel in the very centre\\r\\nof the enemy\\'s country, on the very summit of his highest mountain;\\r\\nfrom its impregnable watchtowers, his camps and arsenals, his columns\\r\\nand forts, are all revealed; within its walls the free life continues,\\r\\nwhile the legions of death and pain and despair, and all the servile\\r\\ncaptains of tyrant fate, afford the burghers of that dauntless city\\r\\nnew spectacles of beauty. happy those sacred ramparts, thrice happy\\r\\nthe dwellers on that all-seeing eminence. honour to those brave\\r\\nwarriors who, through countless ages of warfare, have preserved for us\\r\\nthe priceless heritage of liberty, and have kept undefiled by\\r\\nsacrilegious invaders the home of the unsubdued.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the beauty of tragedy does but make visible a quality which, in\\r\\nmore or less obvious shapes, is present always and everywhere in life.\\r\\nin the spectacle of death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and\\r\\nin the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an\\r\\noverpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the\\r\\ninexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange\\r\\nmarriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of\\r\\nsorrow. in these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of\\r\\ntemporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care\\r\\nfor the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the\\r\\ncommon life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft\\r\\nillumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean\\r\\non whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night\\r\\nwithout, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness\\r\\nof humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual\\r\\nsoul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command,\\r\\nagainst the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its\\r\\nhopes and fears. victory, in this struggle with the powers of\\r\\ndarkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the\\r\\ntrue initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. from\\r\\nthat awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation,\\r\\nwisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins.\\r\\nto take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces\\r\\nwhose puppets we seem to be--death and change, the irrevocableness of\\r\\nthe past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the\\r\\nuniverse from vanity to vanity--to feel these things and know them is\\r\\nto conquer them.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is the reason why the past has such magical power. the beauty of\\r\\nits motionless and silent pictures is like the enchanted purity of\\r\\nlate autumn, when the leaves, though one breath would make them fall,\\r\\nstill glow against the sky in golden glory. the past does not change\\r\\nor strive; like duncan, after life\\'s fitful fever it sleeps well; what\\r\\nwas eager and grasping, what was petty and transitory, has faded away,\\r\\nthe things that were beautiful and eternal shine out of it like stars\\r\\nin the night. its beauty, to a soul not worthy of it, is unendurable;\\r\\nbut to a soul which has conquered fate it is the key of religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe life of man, viewed outwardly, is but a small thing in comparison\\r\\nwith the forces of nature. the slave is doomed to worship time and\\r\\nfate and death, because they are greater than anything he finds in\\r\\nhimself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.\\r\\nbut, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their\\r\\npassionless splendour, is greater still. and such thought makes us\\r\\nfree men; we no longer bow before the inevitable in oriental\\r\\nsubjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves. to\\r\\nabandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of\\r\\ntemporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things--this is\\r\\nemancipation, and this is the free man\\'s worship. and this liberation\\r\\nis effected by a contemplation of fate; for fate itself is subdued by\\r\\nthe mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nunited with his fellow-men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a\\r\\ncommon doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always,\\r\\nshedding over every daily task the light of love. the life of man is a\\r\\nlong march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured\\r\\nby weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and\\r\\nwhere none may tarry long. one by one, as they march, our comrades\\r\\nvanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent\\r\\ndeath. very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which\\r\\ntheir happiness or misery is decided. be it ours to shed sunshine on\\r\\ntheir path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give\\r\\nthem the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing\\r\\ncourage, to instil faith in hours of despair. let us not weigh in\\r\\ngrudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of\\r\\ntheir need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses,\\r\\nthat make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are\\r\\nfellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with\\r\\nourselves. and so, when their day is over, when their good and their\\r\\nevil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to\\r\\nfeel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was\\r\\nthe cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their\\r\\nhearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave\\r\\nwords in which high courage glowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nbrief and powerless is man\\'s life; on him and all his race the slow,\\r\\nsure doom falls pitiless and dark. blind to good and evil, reckless of\\r\\ndestruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way; for man,\\r\\ncondemned to-day to lose his dearest, to-morrow himself to pass\\r\\nthrough the gate of darkness, it remains only to cherish, ere yet the\\r\\nblow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble his little day; disdaining\\r\\nthe coward terrors of the slave of fate, to worship at the shrine that\\r\\nhis own hands have built; undismayed by the empire of chance, to\\r\\npreserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules his outward\\r\\nlife; proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate, for a\\r\\nmoment, his knowledge and his condemnation, to sustain alone, a weary\\r\\nbut unyielding atlas, the world that his own ideals have fashioned\\r\\ndespite the trampling march of unconscious power.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[9] reprinted from the _independent review_, december, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niv\\r\\n\\r\\nthe study of mathematics\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to every form of human activity it is necessary that the\\r\\nquestion should be asked from time to time, what is its purpose and\\r\\nideal? in what way does it contribute to the beauty of human\\r\\nexistence? as respects those pursuits which contribute only remotely,\\r\\nby providing the mechanism of life, it is well to be reminded that not\\r\\nthe mere fact of living is to be desired, but the art of living in the\\r\\ncontemplation of great things. still more in regard to those\\r\\navocations which have no end outside themselves, which are to be\\r\\njustified, if at all, as actually adding to the sum of the world\\'s\\r\\npermanent possessions, it is necessary to keep alive a knowledge of\\r\\ntheir aims, a clear prefiguring vision of the temple in which creative\\r\\nimagination is to be embodied.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fulfilment of this need, in what concerns the studies forming the\\r\\nmaterial upon which custom has decided to train the youthful mind, is\\r\\nindeed sadly remote--so remote as to make the mere statement of such a\\r\\nclaim appear preposterous. great men, fully alive to the beauty of the\\r\\ncontemplations to whose service their lives are devoted, desiring that\\r\\nothers may share in their joys, persuade mankind to impart to the\\r\\nsuccessive generations the mechanical knowledge without which it is\\r\\nimpossible to cross the threshold. dry pedants possess themselves of\\r\\nthe privilege of instilling this knowledge: they forget that it is to\\r\\nserve but as a key to open the doors of the temple; though they spend\\r\\ntheir lives on the steps leading up to those sacred doors, they turn\\r\\ntheir backs upon the temple so resolutely that its very existence is\\r\\nforgotten, and the eager youth, who would press forward to be\\r\\ninitiated to its domes and arches, is bidden to turn back and count\\r\\nthe steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nmathematics, perhaps more even than the study of greece and rome, has\\r\\nsuffered from this oblivion of its due place in civilisation. although\\r\\ntradition has decreed that the great bulk of educated men shall know\\r\\nat least the elements of the subject, the reasons for which the\\r\\ntradition arose are forgotten, buried beneath a great rubbish-heap of\\r\\npedantries and trivialities. to those who inquire as to the purpose of\\r\\nmathematics, the usual answer will be that it facilitates the making\\r\\nof machines, the travelling from place to place, and the victory over\\r\\nforeign nations, whether in war or commerce. if it be objected that\\r\\nthese ends--all of which are of doubtful value--are not furthered by\\r\\nthe merely elementary study imposed upon those who do not become\\r\\nexpert mathematicians, the reply, it is true, will probably be that\\r\\nmathematics trains the reasoning faculties. yet the very men who make\\r\\nthis reply are, for the most part, unwilling to abandon the teaching\\r\\nof definite fallacies, known to be such, and instinctively rejected by\\r\\nthe unsophisticated mind of every intelligent learner. and the\\r\\nreasoning faculty itself is generally conceived, by those who urge its\\r\\ncultivation, as merely a means for the avoidance of pitfalls and a\\r\\nhelp in the discovery of rules for the guidance of practical life. all\\r\\nthese are undeniably important achievements to the credit of\\r\\nmathematics; yet it is none of these that entitles mathematics to a\\r\\nplace in every liberal education. plato, we know, regarded the\\r\\ncontemplation of mathematical truths as worthy of the deity; and\\r\\nplato realised, more perhaps than any other single man, what those\\r\\nelements are in human life which merit a place in heaven. there is in\\r\\nmathematics, he says, \"something which is _necessary_ and cannot be\\r\\nset aside ... and, if i mistake not, of divine necessity; for as to\\r\\nthe human necessities of which the many talk in this connection,\\r\\nnothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the words.\\r\\n_cleinias._ and what are these necessities of knowledge, stranger,\\r\\nwhich are divine and not human? _athenian._ those things without some\\r\\nuse or knowledge of which a man cannot become a god to the world, nor\\r\\na spirit, nor yet a hero, nor able earnestly to think and care for\\r\\nman\" (_laws_, p. 818).[10] such was plato\\'s judgment of mathematics;\\r\\nbut the mathematicians do not read plato, while those who read him\\r\\nknow no mathematics, and regard his opinion upon this question as\\r\\nmerely a curious aberration.\\r\\n\\r\\nmathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme\\r\\nbeauty--a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without\\r\\nappeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous\\r\\ntrappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a\\r\\nstern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. the true\\r\\nspirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man,\\r\\nwhich is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in\\r\\nmathematics as surely as in poetry. what is best in mathematics\\r\\ndeserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a\\r\\npart of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind\\r\\nwith ever-renewed encouragement. real life is, to most men, a long\\r\\nsecond-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the\\r\\npossible; but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no\\r\\npractical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying\\r\\nin splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from\\r\\nwhich all great work springs. remote from human passions, remote even\\r\\nfrom the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually\\r\\ncreated an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its\\r\\nnatural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can\\r\\nescape from the dreary exile of the actual world.\\r\\n\\r\\nso little, however, have mathematicians aimed at beauty, that hardly\\r\\nanything in their work has had this conscious purpose. much, owing to\\r\\nirrepressible instincts, which were better than avowed beliefs, has\\r\\nbeen moulded by an unconscious taste; but much also has been spoilt by\\r\\nfalse notions of what was fitting. the characteristic excellence of\\r\\nmathematics is only to be found where the reasoning is rigidly\\r\\nlogical: the rules of logic are to mathematics what those of structure\\r\\nare to architecture. in the most beautiful work, a chain of argument\\r\\nis presented in which every link is important on its own account, in\\r\\nwhich there is an air of ease and lucidity throughout, and the\\r\\npremises achieve more than would have been thought possible, by means\\r\\nwhich appear natural and inevitable. literature embodies what is\\r\\ngeneral in particular circumstances whose universal significance\\r\\nshines through their individual dress; but mathematics endeavours to\\r\\npresent whatever is most general in its purity, without any irrelevant\\r\\ntrappings.\\r\\n\\r\\nhow should the teaching of mathematics be conducted so as to\\r\\ncommunicate to the learner as much as possible of this high ideal?\\r\\nhere experience must, in a great measure, be our guide; but some\\r\\nmaxims may result from our consideration of the ultimate purpose to be\\r\\nachieved.\\r\\n\\r\\none of the chief ends served by mathematics, when rightly taught, is\\r\\nto awaken the learner\\'s belief in reason, his confidence in the truth\\r\\nof what has been demonstrated, and in the value of demonstration. this\\r\\npurpose is not served by existing instruction; but it is easy to see\\r\\nways in which it might be served. at present, in what concerns\\r\\narithmetic, the boy or girl is given a set of rules, which present\\r\\nthemselves as neither true nor false, but as merely the will of the\\r\\nteacher, the way in which, for some unfathomable reason, the teacher\\r\\nprefers to have the game played. to some degree, in a study of such\\r\\ndefinite practical utility, this is no doubt unavoidable; but as soon\\r\\nas possible, the reasons of rules should be set forth by whatever\\r\\nmeans most readily appeal to the childish mind. in geometry, instead\\r\\nof the tedious apparatus of fallacious proofs for obvious truisms\\r\\nwhich constitutes the beginning of euclid, the learner should be\\r\\nallowed at first to assume the truth of everything obvious, and should\\r\\nbe instructed in the demonstrations of theorems which are at once\\r\\nstartling and easily verifiable by actual drawing, such as those in\\r\\nwhich it is shown that three or more lines meet in a point. in this\\r\\nway belief is generated; it is seen that reasoning may lead to\\r\\nstartling conclusions, which nevertheless the facts will verify; and\\r\\nthus the instinctive distrust of whatever is abstract or rational is\\r\\ngradually overcome. where theorems are difficult, they should be first\\r\\ntaught as exercises in geometrical drawing, until the figure has\\r\\nbecome thoroughly familiar; it will then be an agreeable advance to be\\r\\ntaught the logical connections of the various lines or circles that\\r\\noccur. it is desirable also that the figure illustrating a theorem\\r\\nshould be drawn in all possible cases and shapes, that so the abstract\\r\\nrelations with which geometry is concerned may of themselves emerge\\r\\nas the residue of similarity amid such great apparent diversity. in\\r\\nthis way the abstract demonstrations should form but a small part of\\r\\nthe instruction, and should be given when, by familiarity with\\r\\nconcrete illustrations, they have come to be felt as the natural\\r\\nembodiment of visible fact. in this early stage proofs should not be\\r\\ngiven with pedantic fullness; definitely fallacious methods, such as\\r\\nthat of superposition, should be rigidly excluded from the first, but\\r\\nwhere, without such methods, the proof would be very difficult, the\\r\\nresult should be rendered acceptable by arguments and illustrations\\r\\nwhich are explicitly contrasted with demonstrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the beginning of algebra, even the most intelligent child finds, as\\r\\na rule, very great difficulty. the use of letters is a mystery, which\\r\\nseems to have no purpose except mystification. it is almost\\r\\nimpossible, at first, not to think that every letter stands for some\\r\\nparticular number, if only the teacher would reveal _what_ number it\\r\\nstands for. the fact is, that in algebra the mind is first taught to\\r\\nconsider general truths, truths which are not asserted to hold only of\\r\\nthis or that particular thing, but of any one of a whole group of\\r\\nthings. it is in the power of understanding and discovering such\\r\\ntruths that the mastery of the intellect over the whole world of\\r\\nthings actual and possible resides; and ability to deal with the\\r\\ngeneral as such is one of the gifts that a mathematical education\\r\\nshould bestow. but how little, as a rule, is the teacher of algebra\\r\\nable to explain the chasm which divides it from arithmetic, and how\\r\\nlittle is the learner assisted in his groping efforts at\\r\\ncomprehension! usually the method that has been adopted in arithmetic\\r\\nis continued: rules are set forth, with no adequate explanation of\\r\\ntheir grounds; the pupil learns to use the rules blindly, and\\r\\npresently, when he is able to obtain the answer that the teacher\\r\\ndesires, he feels that he has mastered the difficulties of the\\r\\nsubject. but of inner comprehension of the processes employed he has\\r\\nprobably acquired almost nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen algebra has been learnt, all goes smoothly until we reach those\\r\\nstudies in which the notion of infinity is employed--the infinitesimal\\r\\ncalculus and the whole of higher mathematics. the solution of the\\r\\ndifficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is\\r\\nprobably the greatest achievement of which our own age has to boast.\\r\\nsince the beginnings of greek thought these difficulties have been\\r\\nknown; in every age the finest intellects have vainly endeavoured to\\r\\nanswer the apparently unanswerable questions that had been asked by\\r\\nzeno the eleatic. at last georg cantor has found the answer, and has\\r\\nconquered for the intellect a new and vast province which had been\\r\\ngiven over to chaos and old night. it was assumed as self-evident,\\r\\nuntil cantor and dedekind established the opposite, that if, from any\\r\\ncollection of things, some were taken away, the number of things left\\r\\nmust always be less than the original number of things. this\\r\\nassumption, as a matter of fact, holds only of finite collections; and\\r\\nthe rejection of it, where the infinite is concerned, has been shown\\r\\nto remove all the difficulties that had hitherto baffled human reason\\r\\nin this matter, and to render possible the creation of an exact\\r\\nscience of the infinite. this stupendous fact ought to produce a\\r\\nrevolution in the higher teaching of mathematics; it has itself added\\r\\nimmeasurably to the educational value of the subject, and it has at\\r\\nlast given the means of treating with logical precision many studies\\r\\nwhich, until lately, were wrapped in fallacy and obscurity. by those\\r\\nwho were educated on the old lines, the new work is considered to be\\r\\nappallingly difficult, abstruse, and obscure; and it must be confessed\\r\\nthat the discoverer, as is so often the case, has hardly himself\\r\\nemerged from the mists which the light of his intellect is dispelling.\\r\\nbut inherently, the new doctrine of the infinite, to all candid and\\r\\ninquiring minds, has facilitated the mastery of higher mathematics;\\r\\nfor hitherto, it has been necessary to learn, by a long process of\\r\\nsophistication, to give assent to arguments which, on first\\r\\nacquaintance, were rightly judged to be confused and erroneous. so far\\r\\nfrom producing a fearless belief in reason, a bold rejection of\\r\\nwhatever failed to fulfil the strictest requirements of logic, a\\r\\nmathematical training, during the past two centuries, encouraged the\\r\\nbelief that many things, which a rigid inquiry would reject as\\r\\nfallacious, must yet be accepted because they work in what the\\r\\nmathematician calls \"practice.\" by this means, a timid, compromising\\r\\nspirit, or else a sacerdotal belief in mysteries not intelligible to\\r\\nthe profane, has been bred where reason alone should have ruled. all\\r\\nthis it is now time to sweep away; let those who wish to penetrate\\r\\ninto the arcana of mathematics be taught at once the true theory in\\r\\nall its logical purity, and in the concatenation established by the\\r\\nvery essence of the entities concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we are considering mathematics as an end in itself, and not as a\\r\\ntechnical training for engineers, it is very desirable to preserve the\\r\\npurity and strictness of its reasoning. accordingly those who have\\r\\nattained a sufficient familiarity with its easier portions should be\\r\\nled backward from propositions to which they have assented as\\r\\nself-evident to more and more fundamental principles from which what\\r\\nhad previously appeared as premises can be deduced. they should be\\r\\ntaught--what the theory of infinity very aptly illustrates--that many\\r\\npropositions seem self-evident to the untrained mind which,\\r\\nnevertheless, a nearer scrutiny shows to be false. by this means they\\r\\nwill be led to a sceptical inquiry into first principles, an\\r\\nexamination of the foundations upon which the whole edifice of\\r\\nreasoning is built, or, to take perhaps a more fitting metaphor, the\\r\\ngreat trunk from which the spreading branches spring. at this stage,\\r\\nit is well to study afresh the elementary portions of mathematics,\\r\\nasking no longer merely whether a given proposition is true, but also\\r\\nhow it grows out of the central principles of logic. questions of this\\r\\nnature can now be answered with a precision and certainty which were\\r\\nformerly quite impossible; and in the chains of reasoning that the\\r\\nanswer requires the unity of all mathematical studies at last unfolds\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the great majority of mathematical text-books there is a total lack\\r\\nof unity in method and of systematic development of a central theme.\\r\\npropositions of very diverse kinds are proved by whatever means are\\r\\nthought most easily intelligible, and much space is devoted to mere\\r\\ncuriosities which in no way contribute to the main argument. but in\\r\\nthe greatest works, unity and inevitability are felt as in the\\r\\nunfolding of a drama; in the premisses a subject is proposed for\\r\\nconsideration, and in every subsequent step some definite advance is\\r\\nmade towards mastery of its nature. the love of system, of\\r\\ninterconnection, which is perhaps the inmost essence of the\\r\\nintellectual impulse, can find free play in mathematics as nowhere\\r\\nelse. the learner who feels this impulse must not be repelled by an\\r\\narray of meaningless examples or distracted by amusing oddities, but\\r\\nmust be encouraged to dwell upon central principles, to become\\r\\nfamiliar with the structure of the various subjects which are put\\r\\nbefore him, to travel easily over the steps of the more important\\r\\ndeductions. in this way a good tone of mind is cultivated, and\\r\\nselective attention is taught to dwell by preference upon what is\\r\\nweighty and essential.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the separate studies into which mathematics is divided have each\\r\\nbeen viewed as a logical whole, as a natural growth from the\\r\\npropositions which constitute their principles, the learner will be\\r\\nable to understand the fundamental science which unifies and\\r\\nsystematises the whole of deductive reasoning. this is symbolic\\r\\nlogic--a study which, though it owes its inception to aristotle, is\\r\\nyet, in its wider developments, a product, almost wholly, of the\\r\\nnineteenth century, and is indeed, in the present day, still growing\\r\\nwith great rapidity. the true method of discovery in symbolic logic,\\r\\nand probably also the best method for introducing the study to a\\r\\nlearner acquainted with other parts of mathematics, is the analysis of\\r\\nactual examples of deductive reasoning, with a view to the discovery\\r\\nof the principles employed. these principles, for the most part, are\\r\\nso embedded in our ratiocinative instincts, that they are employed\\r\\nquite unconsciously, and can be dragged to light only by much patient\\r\\neffort. but when at last they have been found, they are seen to be few\\r\\nin number, and to be the sole source of everything in pure\\r\\nmathematics. the discovery that all mathematics follows inevitably\\r\\nfrom a small collection of fundamental laws is one which immeasurably\\r\\nenhances the intellectual beauty of the whole; to those who have been\\r\\noppressed by the fragmentary and incomplete nature of most existing\\r\\nchains of deduction this discovery comes with all the overwhelming\\r\\nforce of a revelation; like a palace emerging from the autumn mist as\\r\\nthe traveller ascends an italian hill-side, the stately storeys of the\\r\\nmathematical edifice appear in their due order and proportion, with a\\r\\nnew perfection in every part.\\r\\n\\r\\nuntil symbolic logic had acquired its present development, the\\r\\nprinciples upon which mathematics depends were always supposed to be\\r\\nphilosophical, and discoverable only by the uncertain, unprogressive\\r\\nmethods hitherto employed by philosophers. so long as this was\\r\\nthought, mathematics seemed to be not autonomous, but dependent upon a\\r\\nstudy which had quite other methods than its own. moreover, since the\\r\\nnature of the postulates from which arithmetic, analysis, and geometry\\r\\nare to be deduced was wrapped in all the traditional obscurities of\\r\\nmetaphysical discussion, the edifice built upon such dubious\\r\\nfoundations began to be viewed as no better than a castle in the air.\\r\\nin this respect, the discovery that the true principles are as much a\\r\\npart of mathematics as any of their consequences has very greatly\\r\\nincreased the intellectual satisfaction to be obtained. this\\r\\nsatisfaction ought not to be refused to learners capable of enjoying\\r\\nit, for it is of a kind to increase our respect for human powers and\\r\\nour knowledge of the beauties belonging to the abstract world.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophers have commonly held that the laws of logic, which underlie\\r\\nmathematics, are laws of thought, laws regulating the operations of\\r\\nour minds. by this opinion the true dignity of reason is very greatly\\r\\nlowered: it ceases to be an investigation into the very heart and\\r\\nimmutable essence of all things actual and possible, becoming,\\r\\ninstead, an inquiry into something more or less human and subject to\\r\\nour limitations. the contemplation of what is non-human, the discovery\\r\\nthat our minds are capable of dealing with material not created by\\r\\nthem, above all, the realisation that beauty belongs to the outer\\r\\nworld as to the inner, are the chief means of overcoming the terrible\\r\\nsense of impotence, of weakness, of exile amid hostile powers, which\\r\\nis too apt to result from acknowledging the all-but omnipotence of\\r\\nalien forces. to reconcile us, by the exhibition of its awful beauty,\\r\\nto the reign of fate--which is merely the literary personification of\\r\\nthese forces--is the task of tragedy. but mathematics takes us still\\r\\nfurther from what is human, into the region of absolute necessity, to\\r\\nwhich not only the actual world, but every possible world, must\\r\\nconform; and even here it builds a habitation, or rather finds a\\r\\nhabitation eternally standing, where our ideals are fully satisfied\\r\\nand our best hopes are not thwarted. it is only when we thoroughly\\r\\nunderstand the entire independence of ourselves, which belongs to this\\r\\nworld that reason finds, that we can adequately realise the profound\\r\\nimportance of its beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in\\r\\nanother sense we and the whole universe of existing things are\\r\\nindependent of mathematics. the apprehension of this purely ideal\\r\\ncharacter is indispensable, if we are to understand rightly the place\\r\\nof mathematics as one among the arts. it was formerly supposed that\\r\\npure reason could decide, in some respects, as to the nature of the\\r\\nactual world: geometry, at least, was thought to deal with the space\\r\\nin which we live. but we now know that pure mathematics can never\\r\\npronounce upon questions of actual existence: the world of reason, in\\r\\na sense, controls the world of fact, but it is not at any point\\r\\ncreative of fact, and in the application of its results to the world\\r\\nin time and space, its certainty and precision are lost among\\r\\napproximations and working hypotheses. the objects considered by\\r\\nmathematicians have, in the past, been mainly of a kind suggested by\\r\\nphenomena; but from such restrictions the abstract imagination should\\r\\nbe wholly free. a reciprocal liberty must thus be accorded: reason\\r\\ncannot dictate to the world of facts, but the facts cannot restrict\\r\\nreason\\'s privilege of dealing with whatever objects its love of beauty\\r\\nmay cause to seem worthy of consideration. here, as elsewhere, we\\r\\nbuild up our own ideals out of the fragments to be found in the world;\\r\\nand in the end it is hard to say whether the result is a creation or a\\r\\ndiscovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is very desirable, in instruction, not merely to persuade the\\r\\nstudent of the accuracy of important theorems, but to persuade him in\\r\\nthe way which itself has, of all possible ways, the most beauty. the\\r\\ntrue interest of a demonstration is not, as traditional modes of\\r\\nexposition suggest, concentrated wholly in the result; where this does\\r\\noccur, it must be viewed as a defect, to be remedied, if possible, by\\r\\nso generalising the steps of the proof that each becomes important in\\r\\nand for itself. an argument which serves only to prove a conclusion is\\r\\nlike a story subordinated to some moral which it is meant to teach:\\r\\nfor sthetic perfection no part of the whole should be merely a means.\\r\\na certain practical spirit, a desire for rapid progress, for conquest\\r\\nof new realms, is responsible for the undue emphasis upon results\\r\\nwhich prevails in mathematical instruction. the better way is to\\r\\npropose some theme for consideration--in geometry, a figure having\\r\\nimportant properties; in analysis, a function of which the study is\\r\\nilluminating, and so on. whenever proofs depend upon some only of the\\r\\nmarks by which we define the object to be studied, these marks should\\r\\nbe isolated and investigated on their own account. for it is a defect,\\r\\nin an argument, to employ more premisses than the conclusion demands:\\r\\nwhat mathematicians call elegance results from employing only the\\r\\nessential principles in virtue of which the thesis is true. it is a\\r\\nmerit in euclid that he advances as far as he is able to go without\\r\\nemploying the axiom of parallels--not, as is often said, because this\\r\\naxiom is inherently objectionable, but because, in mathematics, every\\r\\nnew axiom diminishes the generality of the resulting theorems, and the\\r\\ngreatest possible generality is before all things to be sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nof the effects of mathematics outside its own sphere more has been\\r\\nwritten than on the subject of its own proper ideal. the effect upon\\r\\nphilosophy has, in the past, been most notable, but most varied; in\\r\\nthe seventeenth century, idealism and rationalism, in the eighteenth,\\r\\nmaterialism and sensationalism, seemed equally its offspring. of the\\r\\neffect which it is likely to have in the future it would be very rash\\r\\nto say much; but in one respect a good result appears probable.\\r\\nagainst that kind of scepticism which abandons the pursuit of ideals\\r\\nbecause the road is arduous and the goal not certainly attainable,\\r\\nmathematics, within its own sphere, is a complete answer. too often it\\r\\nis said that there is no absolute truth, but only opinion and private\\r\\njudgment; that each of us is conditioned, in his view of the world, by\\r\\nhis own peculiarities, his own taste and bias; that there is no\\r\\nexternal kingdom of truth to which, by patience and discipline, we may\\r\\nat last obtain admittance, but only truth for me, for you, for every\\r\\nseparate person. by this habit of mind one of the chief ends of human\\r\\neffort is denied, and the supreme virtue of candour, of fearless\\r\\nacknowledgment of what is, disappears from our moral vision. of such\\r\\nscepticism mathematics is a perpetual reproof; for its edifice of\\r\\ntruths stands unshakable and inexpungable to all the weapons of\\r\\ndoubting cynicism.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe effects of mathematics upon practical life, though they should not\\r\\nbe regarded as the motive of our studies, may be used to answer a\\r\\ndoubt to which the solitary student must always be liable. in a world\\r\\nso full of evil and suffering, retirement into the cloister of\\r\\ncontemplation, to the enjoyment of delights which, however noble, must\\r\\nalways be for the few only, cannot but appear as a somewhat selfish\\r\\nrefusal to share the burden imposed upon others by accidents in which\\r\\njustice plays no part. have any of us the right, we ask, to withdraw\\r\\nfrom present evils, to leave our fellow-men unaided, while we live a\\r\\nlife which, though arduous and austere, is yet plainly good in its own\\r\\nnature? when these questions arise, the true answer is, no doubt, that\\r\\nsome must keep alive the sacred fire, some must preserve, in every\\r\\ngeneration, the haunting vision which shadows forth the goal of so\\r\\nmuch striving. but when, as must sometimes occur, this answer seems\\r\\ntoo cold, when we are almost maddened by the spectacle of sorrows to\\r\\nwhich we bring no help, then we may reflect that indirectly the\\r\\nmathematician often does more for human happiness than any of his more\\r\\npractically active contemporaries. the history of science abundantly\\r\\nproves that a body of abstract propositions--even if, as in the case\\r\\nof conic sections, it remains two thousand years without effect upon\\r\\ndaily life--may yet, at any moment, be used to cause a revolution in\\r\\nthe habitual thoughts and occupations of every citizen. the use of\\r\\nsteam and electricity--to take striking instances--is rendered\\r\\npossible only by mathematics. in the results of abstract thought the\\r\\nworld possesses a capital of which the employment in enriching the\\r\\ncommon round has no hitherto discoverable limits. nor does experience\\r\\ngive any means of deciding what parts of mathematics will be found\\r\\nuseful. utility, therefore, can be only a consolation in moments of\\r\\ndiscouragement, not a guide in directing our studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor the health of the moral life, for ennobling the tone of an age or\\r\\na nation, the austerer virtues have a strange power, exceeding the\\r\\npower of those not informed and purified by thought. of these austerer\\r\\nvirtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than\\r\\nelsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith.\\r\\nevery great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of\\r\\ncreating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind; and this purpose should\\r\\nbe kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of\\r\\nmathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[10] this passage was pointed out to me by professor gilbert murray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\nmathematics and the metaphysicians\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe nineteenth century, which prided itself upon the invention of\\r\\nsteam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to\\r\\nfame from the discovery of pure mathematics. this science, like most\\r\\nothers, was baptised long before it was born; and thus we find writers\\r\\nbefore the nineteenth century alluding to what they called pure\\r\\nmathematics. but if they had been asked what this subject was, they\\r\\nwould only have been able to say that it consisted of arithmetic,\\r\\nalgebra, geometry, and so on. as to what these studies had in common,\\r\\nand as to what distinguished them from applied mathematics, our\\r\\nancestors were completely in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\npure mathematics was discovered by boole, in a work which he called\\r\\nthe _laws of thought_ (1854). this work abounds in asseverations that\\r\\nit is not mathematical, the fact being that boole was too modest to\\r\\nsuppose his book the first ever written on mathematics. he was also\\r\\nmistaken in supposing that he was dealing with the laws of thought:\\r\\nthe question how people actually think was quite irrelevant to him,\\r\\nand if his book had really contained the laws of thought, it was\\r\\ncurious that no one should ever have thought in such a way before. his\\r\\nbook was in fact concerned with formal logic, and this is the same\\r\\nthing as mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\npure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that,\\r\\nif such and such a proposition is true of _anything_, then such and\\r\\nsuch another proposition is true of that thing. it is essential not to\\r\\ndiscuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to\\r\\nmention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true. both\\r\\nthese points would belong to applied mathematics. we start, in pure\\r\\nmathematics, from certain rules of inference, by which we can infer\\r\\nthat _if_ one proposition is true, then so is some other proposition.\\r\\nthese rules of inference constitute the major part of the principles\\r\\nof formal logic. we then take any hypothesis that seems amusing, and\\r\\ndeduce its consequences. _if_ our hypothesis is about _anything_, and\\r\\nnot about some one or more particular things, then our deductions\\r\\nconstitute mathematics. thus mathematics may be defined as the subject\\r\\nin which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we\\r\\nare saying is true. people who have been puzzled by the beginnings of\\r\\nmathematics will, i hope, find comfort in this definition, and will\\r\\nprobably agree that it is accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\nas one of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics consists in having\\r\\ndiscovered what mathematics really is, a few more words on this\\r\\nsubject may not be amiss. it is common to start any branch of\\r\\nmathematics--for instance, geometry--with a certain number of\\r\\nprimitive ideas, supposed incapable of definition, and a certain\\r\\nnumber of primitive propositions or axioms, supposed incapable of\\r\\nproof. now the fact is that, though there are indefinables and\\r\\nindemonstrables in every branch of applied mathematics, there are none\\r\\nin pure mathematics except such as belong to general logic. logic,\\r\\nbroadly speaking, is distinguished by the fact that its propositions\\r\\ncan be put into a form in which they apply to anything whatever. all\\r\\npure mathematics--arithmetic, analysis, and geometry--is built up by\\r\\ncombinations of the primitive ideas of logic, and its propositions are\\r\\ndeduced from the general axioms of logic, such as the syllogism and\\r\\nthe other rules of inference. and this is no longer a dream or an\\r\\naspiration. on the contrary, over the greater and more difficult part\\r\\nof the domain of mathematics, it has been already accomplished; in the\\r\\nfew remaining cases, there is no special difficulty, and it is now\\r\\nbeing rapidly achieved. philosophers have disputed for ages whether\\r\\nsuch deduction was possible; mathematicians have sat down and made the\\r\\ndeduction. for the philosophers there is now nothing left but graceful\\r\\nacknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe subject of formal logic, which has thus at last shown itself to be\\r\\nidentical with mathematics, was, as every one knows, invented by\\r\\naristotle, and formed the chief study (other than theology) of the\\r\\nmiddle ages. but aristotle never got beyond the syllogism, which is a\\r\\nvery small part of the subject, and the schoolmen never got beyond\\r\\naristotle. if any proof were required of our superiority to the\\r\\nmedival doctors, it might be found in this. throughout the middle\\r\\nages, almost all the best intellects devoted themselves to formal\\r\\nlogic, whereas in the nineteenth century only an infinitesimal\\r\\nproportion of the world\\'s thought went into this subject.\\r\\nnevertheless, in each decade since 1850 more has been done to advance\\r\\nthe subject than in the whole period from aristotle to leibniz. people\\r\\nhave discovered how to make reasoning symbolic, as it is in algebra,\\r\\nso that deductions are effected by mathematical rules. they have\\r\\ndiscovered many rules besides the syllogism, and a new branch of\\r\\nlogic, called the logic of relatives,[11] has been invented to deal\\r\\nwith topics that wholly surpassed the powers of the old logic, though\\r\\nthey form the chief contents of mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not easy for the lay mind to realise the importance of symbolism\\r\\nin discussing the foundations of mathematics, and the explanation may\\r\\nperhaps seem strangely paradoxical. the fact is that symbolism is\\r\\nuseful because it makes things difficult. (this is not true of the\\r\\nadvanced parts of mathematics, but only of the beginnings.) what we\\r\\nwish to know is, what can be deduced from what. now, in the\\r\\nbeginnings, everything is self-evident; and it is very hard to see\\r\\nwhether one self-evident proposition follows from another or not.\\r\\nobviousness is always the enemy to correctness. hence we invent some\\r\\nnew and difficult symbolism, in which nothing seems obvious. then we\\r\\nset up certain rules for operating on the symbols, and the whole thing\\r\\nbecomes mechanical. in this way we find out what must be taken as\\r\\npremiss and what can be demonstrated or defined. for instance, the\\r\\nwhole of arithmetic and algebra has been shown to require three\\r\\nindefinable notions and five indemonstrable propositions. but without\\r\\na symbolism it would have been very hard to find this out. it is so\\r\\nobvious that two and two are four, that we can hardly make ourselves\\r\\nsufficiently sceptical to doubt whether it can be proved. and the same\\r\\nholds in other cases where self-evident things are to be proved.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the proof of self-evident propositions may seem, to the\\r\\nuninitiated, a somewhat frivolous occupation. to this we might reply\\r\\nthat it is often by no means self-evident that one obvious proposition\\r\\nfollows from another obvious proposition; so that we are really\\r\\ndiscovering new truths when we prove what is evident by a method which\\r\\nis not evident. but a more interesting retort is, that since people\\r\\nhave tried to prove obvious propositions, they have found that many of\\r\\nthem are false. self-evidence is often a mere will-o\\'-the-wisp, which\\r\\nis sure to lead us astray if we take it as our guide. for instance,\\r\\nnothing is plainer than that a whole always has more terms than a\\r\\npart, or that a number is increased by adding one to it. but these\\r\\npropositions are now known to be usually false. most numbers are\\r\\ninfinite, and if a number is infinite you may add ones to it as long\\r\\nas you like without disturbing it in the least. one of the merits of a\\r\\nproof is that it instils a certain doubt as to the result proved; and\\r\\nwhen what is obvious can be proved in some cases, but not in others,\\r\\nit becomes possible to suppose that in these other cases it is false.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe great master of the art of formal reasoning, among the men of our\\r\\nown day, is an italian, professor peano, of the university of\\r\\nturin.[12] he has reduced the greater part of mathematics (and he or\\r\\nhis followers will, in time, have reduced the whole) to strict\\r\\nsymbolic form, in which there are no words at all. in the ordinary\\r\\nmathematical books, there are no doubt fewer words than most readers\\r\\nwould wish. still, little phrases occur, such as _therefore, let us\\r\\nassume, consider_, or _hence it follows_. all these, however, are a\\r\\nconcession, and are swept away by professor peano. for instance, if we\\r\\nwish to learn the whole of arithmetic, algebra, the calculus, and\\r\\nindeed all that is usually called pure mathematics (except geometry),\\r\\nwe must start with a dictionary of three words. one symbol stands for\\r\\n_zero_, another for _number_, and a third for _next after_. what these\\r\\nideas mean, it is necessary to know if you wish to become an\\r\\narithmetician. but after symbols have been invented for these three\\r\\nideas, not another word is required in the whole development. all\\r\\nfuture symbols are symbolically explained by means of these three.\\r\\neven these three can be explained by means of the notions of\\r\\n_relation_ and _class_; but this requires the logic of relations,\\r\\nwhich professor peano has never taken up. it must be admitted that\\r\\nwhat a mathematician has to know to begin with is not much. there are\\r\\nat most a dozen notions out of which all the notions in all pure\\r\\nmathematics (including geometry) are compounded. professor peano, who\\r\\nis assisted by a very able school of young italian disciples, has\\r\\nshown how this may be done; and although the method which he has\\r\\ninvented is capable of being carried a good deal further than he has\\r\\ncarried it, the honour of the pioneer must belong to him.\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo hundred years ago, leibniz foresaw the science which peano has\\r\\nperfected, and endeavoured to create it. he was prevented from\\r\\nsucceeding by respect for the authority of aristotle, whom he could\\r\\nnot believe guilty of definite, formal fallacies; but the subject\\r\\nwhich he desired to create now exists, in spite of the patronising\\r\\ncontempt with which his schemes have been treated by all superior\\r\\npersons. from this \"universal characteristic,\" as he called it, he\\r\\nhoped for a solution of all problems, and an end to all disputes. \"if\\r\\ncontroversies were to arise,\" he says, \"there would be no more need of\\r\\ndisputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. for\\r\\nit would suffice to take their pens in their hands, to sit down to\\r\\ntheir desks, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if\\r\\nthey liked), \\'let us calculate.\\'\" this optimism has now appeared to be\\r\\nsomewhat excessive; there still are problems whose solution is\\r\\ndoubtful, and disputes which calculation cannot decide. but over an\\r\\nenormous field of what was formerly controversial, leibniz\\'s dream has\\r\\nbecome sober fact. in the whole philosophy of mathematics, which used\\r\\nto be at least as full of doubt as any other part of philosophy, order\\r\\nand certainty have replaced the confusion and hesitation which\\r\\nformerly reigned. philosophers, of course, have not yet discovered\\r\\nthis fact, and continue to write on such subjects in the old way. but\\r\\nmathematicians, at least in italy, have now the power of treating the\\r\\nprinciples of mathematics in an exact and masterly manner, by means of\\r\\nwhich the certainty of mathematics extends also to mathematical\\r\\nphilosophy. hence many of the topics which used to be placed among the\\r\\ngreat mysteries--for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity,\\r\\nof space, time and motion--are now no longer in any degree open to\\r\\ndoubt or discussion. those who wish to know the nature of these things\\r\\nneed only read the works of such men as peano or georg cantor; they\\r\\nwill there find exact and indubitable expositions of all these quondam\\r\\nmysteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this capricious world, nothing is more capricious than posthumous\\r\\nfame. one of the most notable examples of posterity\\'s lack of judgment\\r\\nis the eleatic zeno. this man, who may be regarded as the founder of\\r\\nthe philosophy of infinity, appears in plato\\'s parmenides in the\\r\\nprivileged position of instructor to socrates. he invented four\\r\\narguments, all immeasurably subtle and profound, to prove that motion\\r\\nis impossible, that achilles can never overtake the tortoise, and that\\r\\nan arrow in flight is really at rest. after being refuted by\\r\\naristotle, and by every subsequent philosopher from that day to our\\r\\nown, these arguments were reinstated, and made the basis of a\\r\\nmathematical renaissance, by a german professor, who probably never\\r\\ndreamed of any connection between himself and zeno. weierstrass,[13]\\r\\nby strictly banishing from mathematics the use of infinitesimals, has\\r\\nat last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow\\r\\nin its flight is truly at rest. zeno\\'s only error lay in inferring (if\\r\\nhe did infer) that, because there is no such thing as a state of\\r\\nchange, therefore the world is in the same state at any one time as at\\r\\nany other. this is a consequence which by no means follows; and in\\r\\nthis respect, the german mathematician is more constructive than the\\r\\ningenious greek. weierstrass has been able, by embodying his views in\\r\\nmathematics, where familiarity with truth eliminates the vulgar\\r\\nprejudices of common sense, to invest zeno\\'s paradoxes with the\\r\\nrespectable air of platitudes; and if the result is less delightful to\\r\\nthe lover of reason than zeno\\'s bold defiance, it is at any rate more\\r\\ncalculated to appease the mass of academic mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nzeno was concerned, as a matter of fact, with three problems, each\\r\\npresented by motion, but each more abstract than motion, and capable\\r\\nof a purely arithmetical treatment. these are the problems of the\\r\\ninfinitesimal, the infinite, and continuity. to state clearly the\\r\\ndifficulties involved, was to accomplish perhaps the hardest part of\\r\\nthe philosopher\\'s task. this was done by zeno. from him to our own\\r\\nday, the finest intellects of each generation in turn attacked the\\r\\nproblems, but achieved, broadly speaking, nothing. in our own time,\\r\\nhowever, three men--weierstrass, dedekind, and cantor--have not merely\\r\\nadvanced the three problems, but have completely solved them. the\\r\\nsolutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to\\r\\nleave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty. this achievement is\\r\\nprobably the greatest of which our age has to boast; and i know of no\\r\\nage (except perhaps the golden age of greece) which has a more\\r\\nconvincing proof to offer of the transcendent genius of its great men.\\r\\nof the three problems, that of the infinitesimal was solved by\\r\\nweierstrass; the solution of the other two was begun by dedekind, and\\r\\ndefinitively accomplished by cantor.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe infinitesimal played formerly a great part in mathematics. it was\\r\\nintroduced by the greeks, who regarded a circle as differing\\r\\ninfinitesimally from a polygon with a very large number of very small\\r\\nequal sides. it gradually grew in importance, until, when leibniz\\r\\ninvented the infinitesimal calculus, it seemed to become the\\r\\nfundamental notion of all higher mathematics. carlyle tells, in his\\r\\n_frederick the great_, how leibniz used to discourse to queen sophia\\r\\ncharlotte of prussia concerning the infinitely little, and how she\\r\\nwould reply that on that subject she needed no instruction--the\\r\\nbehaviour of courtiers had made her thoroughly familiar with it. but\\r\\nphilosophers and mathematicians--who for the most part had less\\r\\nacquaintance with courts--continued to discuss this topic, though\\r\\nwithout making any advance. the calculus required continuity, and\\r\\ncontinuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody\\r\\ncould discover what the infinitely little might be. it was plainly not\\r\\nquite zero, because a sufficiently large number of infinitesimals,\\r\\nadded together, were seen to make up a finite whole. but nobody could\\r\\npoint out any fraction which was not zero, and yet not finite. thus\\r\\nthere was a deadlock. but at last weierstrass discovered that the\\r\\ninfinitesimal was not needed at all, and that everything could be\\r\\naccomplished without it. thus there was no longer any need to suppose\\r\\nthat there was such a thing. nowadays, therefore, mathematicians are\\r\\nmore dignified than leibniz: instead of talking about the infinitely\\r\\nsmall, they talk about the infinitely great--a subject which, however\\r\\nappropriate to monarchs, seems, unfortunately, to interest them even\\r\\nless than the infinitely little interested the monarchs to whom\\r\\nleibniz discoursed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe banishment of the infinitesimal has all sorts of odd consequences,\\r\\nto which one has to become gradually accustomed. for example, there is\\r\\nno such thing as the next moment. the interval between one moment and\\r\\nthe next would have to be infinitesimal, since, if we take two moments\\r\\nwith a finite interval between them, there are always other moments in\\r\\nthe interval. thus if there are to be no infinitesimals, no two\\r\\nmoments are quite consecutive, but there are always other moments\\r\\nbetween any two. hence there must be an infinite number of moments\\r\\nbetween any two; because if there were a finite number one would be\\r\\nnearest the first of the two moments, and therefore next to it. this\\r\\nmight be thought to be a difficulty; but, as a matter of fact, it is\\r\\nhere that the philosophy of the infinite comes in, and makes all\\r\\nstraight.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same sort of thing happens in space. if any piece of matter be cut\\r\\nin two, and then each part be halved, and so on, the bits will become\\r\\nsmaller and smaller, and can theoretically be made as small as we\\r\\nplease. however small they may be, they can still be cut up and made\\r\\nsmaller still. but they will always have _some_ finite size, however\\r\\nsmall they may be. we never reach the infinitesimal in this way, and\\r\\nno finite number of divisions will bring us to points. nevertheless\\r\\nthere _are_ points, only these are not to be reached by successive\\r\\ndivisions. here again, the philosophy of the infinite shows us how\\r\\nthis is possible, and why points are not infinitesimal lengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nas regards motion and change, we get similarly curious results. people\\r\\nused to think that when a thing changes, it must be in a state of\\r\\nchange, and that when a thing moves, it is in a state of motion. this\\r\\nis now known to be a mistake. when a body moves, all that can be said\\r\\nis that it is in one place at one time and in another at another. we\\r\\nmust not say that it will be in a neighbouring place at the next\\r\\ninstant, since there is no next instant. philosophers often tell us\\r\\nthat when a body is in motion, it changes its position within the\\r\\ninstant. to this view zeno long ago made the fatal retort that every\\r\\nbody always is where it is; but a retort so simple and brief was not\\r\\nof the kind to which philosophers are accustomed to give weight, and\\r\\nthey have continued down to our own day to repeat the same phrases\\r\\nwhich roused the eleatic\\'s destructive ardour. it was only recently\\r\\nthat it became possible to explain motion in detail in accordance with\\r\\nzeno\\'s platitude, and in opposition to the philosopher\\'s paradox. we\\r\\nmay now at last indulge the comfortable belief that a body in motion\\r\\nis just as truly where it is as a body at rest. motion consists merely\\r\\nin the fact that bodies are sometimes in one place and sometimes in\\r\\nanother, and that they are at intermediate places at intermediate\\r\\ntimes. only those who have waded through the quagmire of philosophic\\r\\nspeculation on this subject can realise what a liberation from antique\\r\\nprejudices is involved in this simple and straightforward commonplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe philosophy of the infinitesimal, as we have just seen, is mainly\\r\\nnegative. people used to believe in it, and now they have found out\\r\\ntheir mistake. the philosophy of the infinite, on the other hand, is\\r\\nwholly positive. it was formerly supposed that infinite numbers, and\\r\\nthe mathematical infinite generally, were self-contradictory. but as\\r\\nit was obvious that there were infinities--for example, the number of\\r\\nnumbers--the contradictions of infinity seemed unavoidable, and\\r\\nphilosophy seemed to have wandered into a \"cul-de-sac.\" this\\r\\ndifficulty led to kant\\'s antinomies, and hence, more or less\\r\\nindirectly, to much of hegel\\'s dialectic method. almost all current\\r\\nphilosophy is upset by the fact (of which very few philosophers are as\\r\\nyet aware) that all the ancient and respectable contradictions in the\\r\\nnotion of the infinite have been once for all disposed of. the method\\r\\nby which this has been done is most interesting and instructive. in\\r\\nthe first place, though people had talked glibly about infinity ever\\r\\nsince the beginnings of greek thought, nobody had ever thought of\\r\\nasking, what is infinity? if any philosopher had been asked for a\\r\\ndefinition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible\\r\\nrigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a\\r\\ndefinition that had any meaning at all. twenty years ago, roughly\\r\\nspeaking, dedekind and cantor asked this question, and, what is more\\r\\nremarkable, they answered it. they found, that is to say, a perfectly\\r\\nprecise definition of an infinite number or an infinite collection of\\r\\nthings. this was the first and perhaps the greatest step. it then\\r\\nremained to examine the supposed contradictions in this notion. here\\r\\ncantor proceeded in the only proper way. he took pairs of\\r\\ncontradictory propositions, in which both sides of the contradiction\\r\\nwould be usually regarded as demonstrable, and he strictly examined\\r\\nthe supposed proofs. he found that all proofs adverse to infinity\\r\\ninvolved a certain principle, at first sight obviously true, but\\r\\ndestructive, in its consequences, of almost all mathematics. the\\r\\nproofs favourable to infinity, on the other hand, involved no\\r\\nprinciple that had evil consequences. it thus appeared that common\\r\\nsense had allowed itself to be taken in by a specious maxim, and that,\\r\\nwhen once this maxim was rejected, all went well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe maxim in question is, that if one collection is part of another,\\r\\nthe one which is a part has fewer terms than the one of which it is a\\r\\npart. this maxim is true of finite numbers. for example, englishmen\\r\\nare only some among europeans, and there are fewer englishmen than\\r\\neuropeans. but when we come to infinite numbers, this is no longer\\r\\ntrue. this breakdown of the maxim gives us the precise definition of\\r\\ninfinity. a collection of terms is infinite when it contains as parts\\r\\nother collections which have just as many terms as it has. if you can\\r\\ntake away some of the terms of a collection, without diminishing the\\r\\nnumber of terms, then there are an infinite number of terms in the\\r\\ncollection. for example, there are just as many even numbers as there\\r\\nare numbers altogether, since every number can be doubled. this may be\\r\\nseen by putting odd and even numbers together in one row, and even\\r\\nnumbers alone in a row below:--\\r\\n\\r\\n          1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _ad infinitum_.\\r\\n          2, 4, 6, 8, 10, _ad infinitum_.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are obviously just as many numbers in the row below as in the\\r\\nrow above, because there is one below for each one above. this\\r\\nproperty, which was formerly thought to be a contradiction, is now\\r\\ntransformed into a harmless definition of infinity, and shows, in the\\r\\nabove case, that the number of finite numbers is infinite.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the uninitiated may wonder how it is possible to deal with a\\r\\nnumber which cannot be counted. it is impossible to count up _all_ the\\r\\nnumbers, one by one, because, however many we may count, there are\\r\\nalways more to follow. the fact is that counting is a very vulgar and\\r\\nelementary way of finding out how many terms there are in a\\r\\ncollection. and in any case, counting gives us what mathematicians\\r\\ncall the _ordinal_ number of our terms; that is to say, it arranges\\r\\nour terms in an order or series, and its result tells us what type of\\r\\nseries results from this arrangement. in other words, it is impossible\\r\\nto count things without counting some first and others afterwards, so\\r\\nthat counting always has to do with order. now when there are only a\\r\\nfinite number of terms, we can count them in any order we like; but\\r\\nwhen there are an infinite number, what corresponds to counting will\\r\\ngive us quite different results according to the way in which we carry\\r\\nout the operation. thus the ordinal number, which results from what,\\r\\nin a general sense may be called counting, depends not only upon how\\r\\nmany terms we have, but also (where the number of terms is infinite)\\r\\nupon the way in which the terms are arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fundamental infinite numbers are not ordinal, but are what is\\r\\ncalled _cardinal_. they are not obtained by putting our terms in order\\r\\nand counting them, but by a different method, which tells us, to begin\\r\\nwith, whether two collections have the same number of terms, or, if\\r\\nnot, which is the greater.[14] it does not tell us, in the way in\\r\\nwhich counting does, _what_ number of terms a collection has; but if\\r\\nwe define a number as the number of terms in such and such a\\r\\ncollection, then this method enables us to discover whether some other\\r\\ncollection that may be mentioned has more or fewer terms. an\\r\\nillustration will show how this is done. if there existed some country\\r\\nin which, for one reason or another, it was impossible to take a\\r\\ncensus, but in which it was known that every man had a wife and every\\r\\nwoman a husband, then (provided polygamy was not a national\\r\\ninstitution) we should know, without counting, that there were exactly\\r\\nas many men as there were women in that country, neither more nor\\r\\nless. this method can be applied generally. if there is some relation\\r\\nwhich, like marriage, connects the things in one collection each with\\r\\none of the things in another collection, and vice versa, then the two\\r\\ncollections have the same number of terms. this was the way in which\\r\\nwe found that there are as many even numbers as there are numbers.\\r\\nevery number can be doubled, and every even number can be halved, and\\r\\neach process gives just one number corresponding to the one that is\\r\\ndoubled or halved. and in this way we can find any number of\\r\\ncollections each of which has just as many terms as there are finite\\r\\nnumbers. if every term of a collection can be hooked on to a number,\\r\\nand all the finite numbers are used once, and only once, in the\\r\\nprocess, then our collection must have just as many terms as there are\\r\\nfinite numbers. this is the general method by which the numbers of\\r\\ninfinite collections are defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut it must not be supposed that all infinite numbers are equal. on\\r\\nthe contrary, there are infinitely more infinite numbers than finite\\r\\nones. there are more ways of arranging the finite numbers in different\\r\\ntypes of series than there are finite numbers. there are probably more\\r\\npoints in space and more moments in time than there are finite\\r\\nnumbers. there are exactly as many fractions as whole numbers,\\r\\nalthough there are an infinite number of fractions between any two\\r\\nwhole numbers. but there are more irrational numbers than there are\\r\\nwhole numbers or fractions. there are probably exactly as many points\\r\\nin space as there are irrational numbers, and exactly as many points\\r\\non a line a millionth of an inch long as in the whole of infinite\\r\\nspace. there is a greatest of all infinite numbers, which is the\\r\\nnumber of things altogether, of every sort and kind. it is obvious\\r\\nthat there cannot be a greater number than this, because, if\\r\\neverything has been taken, there is nothing left to add. cantor has a\\r\\nproof that there is no greatest number, and if this proof were valid,\\r\\nthe contradictions of infinity would reappear in a sublimated form.\\r\\nbut in this one point, the master has been guilty of a very subtle\\r\\nfallacy, which i hope to explain in some future work.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now understand why zeno believed that achilles cannot overtake\\r\\nthe tortoise and why as a matter of fact he can overtake it. we shall\\r\\nsee that all the people who disagreed with zeno had no right to do so,\\r\\nbecause they all accepted premises from which his conclusion followed.\\r\\nthe argument is this: let achilles and the tortoise start along a road\\r\\nat the same time, the tortoise (as is only fair) being allowed a\\r\\nhandicap. let achilles go twice as fast as the tortoise, or ten times\\r\\nor a hundred times as fast. then he will never reach the tortoise. for\\r\\nat every moment the tortoise is somewhere and achilles is somewhere;\\r\\nand neither is ever twice in the same place while the race is going\\r\\non. thus the tortoise goes to just as many places as achilles does,\\r\\nbecause each is in one place at one moment, and in another at any\\r\\nother moment. but if achilles were to catch up with the tortoise, the\\r\\nplaces where the tortoise would have been would be only part of the\\r\\nplaces where achilles would have been. here, we must suppose, zeno\\r\\nappealed to the maxim that the whole has more terms than the part.[16]\\r\\nthus if achilles were to overtake the tortoise, he would have been in\\r\\nmore places than the tortoise; but we saw that he must, in any period,\\r\\nbe in exactly as many places as the tortoise. hence we infer that he\\r\\ncan never catch the tortoise. this argument is strictly correct, if we\\r\\nallow the axiom that the whole has more terms than the part. as the\\r\\nconclusion is absurd, the axiom must be rejected, and then all goes\\r\\nwell. but there is no good word to be said for the philosophers of the\\r\\npast two thousand years and more, who have all allowed the axiom and\\r\\ndenied the conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe retention of this axiom leads to absolute contradictions, while\\r\\nits rejection leads only to oddities. some of these oddities, it must\\r\\nbe confessed, are very odd. one of them, which i call the paradox of\\r\\ntristram shandy, is the converse of the achilles, and shows that the\\r\\ntortoise, if you give him time, will go just as far as achilles.\\r\\ntristram shandy, as we know, employed two years in chronicling the\\r\\nfirst two days of his life, and lamented that, at this rate, material\\r\\nwould accumulate faster than he could deal with it, so that, as years\\r\\nwent by, he would be farther and farther from the end of his history.\\r\\nnow i maintain that, if he had lived for ever, and had not wearied of\\r\\nhis task, then, even if his life had continued as event fully as it\\r\\nbegan, no part of his biography would have remained unwritten. for\\r\\nconsider: the hundredth day will be described in the hundredth year,\\r\\nthe thousandth in the thousandth year, and so on. whatever day we may\\r\\nchoose as so far on that he cannot hope to reach it, that day will be\\r\\ndescribed in the corresponding year. thus any day that may be\\r\\nmentioned will be written up sooner or later, and therefore no part of\\r\\nthe biography will remain permanently unwritten. this paradoxical but\\r\\nperfectly true proposition depends upon the fact that the number of\\r\\ndays in all time is no greater than the number of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus on the subject of infinity it is impossible to avoid conclusions\\r\\nwhich at first sight appear paradoxical, and this is the reason why so\\r\\nmany philosophers have supposed that there were inherent\\r\\ncontradictions in the infinite. but a little practice enables one to\\r\\ngrasp the true principles of cantor\\'s doctrine, and to acquire new and\\r\\nbetter instincts as to the true and the false. the oddities then\\r\\nbecome no odder than the people at the antipodes, who used to be\\r\\nthought impossible because they would find it so inconvenient to stand\\r\\non their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe solution of the problems concerning infinity has enabled cantor to\\r\\nsolve also the problems of continuity. of this, as of infinity, he has\\r\\ngiven a perfectly precise definition, and has shown that there are no\\r\\ncontradictions in the notion so defined. but this subject is so\\r\\ntechnical that it is impossible to give any account of it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe notion of continuity depends upon that of _order_, since\\r\\ncontinuity is merely a particular type of order. mathematics has, in\\r\\nmodern times, brought order into greater and greater prominence. in\\r\\nformer days, it was supposed (and philosophers are still apt to\\r\\nsuppose) that quantity was the fundamental notion of mathematics. but\\r\\nnowadays, quantity is banished altogether, except from one little\\r\\ncorner of geometry, while order more and more reigns supreme. the\\r\\ninvestigation of different kinds of series and their relations is now\\r\\na very large part of mathematics, and it has been found that this\\r\\ninvestigation can be conducted without any reference to quantity, and,\\r\\nfor the most part, without any reference to number. all types of\\r\\nseries are capable of formal definition, and their properties can be\\r\\ndeduced from the principles of symbolic logic by means of the algebra\\r\\nof relatives. the notion of a limit, which is fundamental in the\\r\\ngreater part of higher mathematics, used to be defined by means of\\r\\nquantity, as a term to which the terms of some series approximate as\\r\\nnearly as we please. but nowadays the limit is defined quite\\r\\ndifferently, and the series which it limits may not approximate to it\\r\\nat all. this improvement also is due to cantor, and it is one which\\r\\nhas revolutionised mathematics. only order is now relevant to limits.\\r\\nthus, for instance, the smallest of the infinite integers is the limit\\r\\nof the finite integers, though all finite integers are at an infinite\\r\\ndistance from it. the study of different types of series is a general\\r\\nsubject of which the study of ordinal numbers (mentioned above) is a\\r\\nspecial and very interesting branch. but the unavoidable\\r\\ntechnicalities of this subject render it impossible to explain to any\\r\\nbut professed mathematicians.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeometry, like arithmetic, has been subsumed, in recent times, under\\r\\nthe general study of order. it was formerly supposed that geometry was\\r\\nthe study of the nature of the space in which we live, and accordingly\\r\\nit was urged, by those who held that what exists can only be known\\r\\nempirically, that geometry should really be regarded as belonging to\\r\\napplied mathematics. but it has gradually appeared, by the increase of\\r\\nnon-euclidean systems, that geometry throws no more light upon the\\r\\nnature of space than arithmetic throws upon the population of the\\r\\nunited states. geometry is a whole collection of deductive sciences\\r\\nbased on a corresponding collection of sets of axioms. one set of\\r\\naxioms is euclid\\'s; other equally good sets of axioms lead to other\\r\\nresults. whether euclid\\'s axioms are true, is a question as to which\\r\\nthe pure mathematician is indifferent; and, what is more, it is a\\r\\nquestion which it is theoretically impossible to answer with certainty\\r\\nin the affirmative. it might possibly be shown, by very careful\\r\\nmeasurements, that euclid\\'s axioms are false; but no measurements\\r\\ncould ever assure us (owing to the errors of observation) that they\\r\\nare exactly true. thus the geometer leaves to the man of science to\\r\\ndecide, as best he may, what axioms are most nearly true in the actual\\r\\nworld. the geometer takes any set of axioms that seem interesting, and\\r\\ndeduces their consequences. what defines geometry, in this sense, is\\r\\nthat the axioms must give rise to a series of more than one dimension.\\r\\nand it is thus that geometry becomes a department in the study of\\r\\norder.\\r\\n\\r\\nin geometry, as in other parts of mathematics, peano and his disciples\\r\\nhave done work of the very greatest merit as regards principles.\\r\\nformerly, it was held by philosophers and mathematicians alike that\\r\\nthe proofs in geometry depended on the figure; nowadays, this is known\\r\\nto be false. in the best books there are no figures at all. the\\r\\nreasoning proceeds by the strict rules of formal logic from a set of\\r\\naxioms laid down to begin with. if a figure is used, all sorts of\\r\\nthings seem obviously to follow, which no formal reasoning can prove\\r\\nfrom the explicit axioms, and which, as a matter of fact, are only\\r\\naccepted because they are obvious. by banishing the figure, it becomes\\r\\npossible to discover _all_ the axioms that are needed; and in this way\\r\\nall sorts of possibilities, which would have otherwise remained\\r\\nundetected, are brought to light.\\r\\n\\r\\none great advance, from the point of view of correctness, has been\\r\\nmade by introducing points as they are required, and not starting, as\\r\\nwas formerly done, by assuming the whole of space. this method is due\\r\\npartly to peano, partly to another italian named fano. to those\\r\\nunaccustomed to it, it has an air of somewhat wilful pedantry. in this\\r\\nway, we begin with the following axioms: (1) there is a class of\\r\\nentities called _points_. (2) there is at least one point. (3) if _a_\\r\\nbe a point, there is at least one other point besides _a_. then we\\r\\nbring in the straight line joining two points, and begin again with\\r\\n(4), namely, on the straight line joining _a_ and _b_, there is at\\r\\nleast one other point besides _a_ and _b_. (5) there is at least one\\r\\npoint not on the line _ab_. and so we go on, till we have the means of\\r\\nobtaining as many points as we require. but the word _space_, as peano\\r\\nhumorously remarks, is one for which geometry has no use at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rigid methods employed by modern geometers have deposed euclid\\r\\nfrom his pinnacle of correctness. it was thought, until recent times,\\r\\nthat, as sir henry savile remarked in 1621, there were only two\\r\\nblemishes in euclid, the theory of parallels and the theory of\\r\\nproportion. it is now known that these are almost the only points in\\r\\nwhich euclid is free from blemish. countless errors are involved in\\r\\nhis first eight propositions. that is to say, not only is it doubtful\\r\\nwhether his axioms are true, which is a comparatively trivial matter,\\r\\nbut it is certain that his propositions do not follow from the axioms\\r\\nwhich he enunciates. a vastly greater number of axioms, which euclid\\r\\nunconsciously employs, are required for the proof of his propositions.\\r\\neven in the first proposition of all, where he constructs an\\r\\nequilateral triangle on a given base, he uses two circles which are\\r\\nassumed to intersect. but no explicit axiom assures us that they do\\r\\nso, and in some kinds of spaces they do not always intersect. it is\\r\\nquite doubtful whether our space belongs to one of these kinds or not.\\r\\nthus euclid fails entirely to prove his point in the very first\\r\\nproposition. as he is certainly not an easy author, and is terribly\\r\\nlong-winded, he has no longer any but an historical interest. under\\r\\nthese circumstances, it is nothing less than a scandal that he should\\r\\nstill be taught to boys in england.[17] a book should have either\\r\\nintelligibility or correctness; to combine the two is impossible, but\\r\\nto lack both is to be unworthy of such a place as euclid has occupied\\r\\nin education.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe most remarkable result of modern methods in mathematics is the\\r\\nimportance of symbolic logic and of rigid formalism. mathematicians,\\r\\nunder the influence of weierstrass, have shown in modern times a care\\r\\nfor accuracy, and an aversion to slipshod reasoning, such as had not\\r\\nbeen known among them previously since the time of the greeks. the\\r\\ngreat inventions of the seventeenth century--analytical geometry and\\r\\nthe infinitesimal calculus--were so fruitful in new results that\\r\\nmathematicians had neither time nor inclination to examine their\\r\\nfoundations. philosophers, who should have taken up the task, had too\\r\\nlittle mathematical ability to invent the new branches of mathematics\\r\\nwhich have now been found necessary for any adequate discussion. thus\\r\\nmathematicians were only awakened from their \"dogmatic slumbers\" when\\r\\nweierstrass and his followers showed that many of their most cherished\\r\\npropositions are in general false. macaulay, contrasting the certainty\\r\\nof mathematics with the uncertainty of philosophy, asks who ever heard\\r\\nof a reaction against taylor\\'s theorem? if he had lived now, he\\r\\nhimself might have heard of such a reaction, for this is precisely one\\r\\nof the theorems which modern investigations have overthrown. such rude\\r\\nshocks to mathematical faith have produced that love of formalism\\r\\nwhich appears, to those who are ignorant of its motive, to be mere\\r\\noutrageous pedantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe proof that all pure mathematics, including geometry, is nothing\\r\\nbut formal logic, is a fatal blow to the kantian philosophy. kant,\\r\\nrightly perceiving that euclid\\'s propositions could not be deduced\\r\\nfrom euclid\\'s axioms without the help of the figures, invented a\\r\\ntheory of knowledge to account for this fact; and it accounted so\\r\\nsuccessfully that, when the fact is shown to be a mere defect in\\r\\neuclid, and not a result of the nature of geometrical reasoning,\\r\\nkant\\'s theory also has to be abandoned. the whole doctrine of _a\\r\\npriori_ intuitions, by which kant explained the possibility of pure\\r\\nmathematics, is wholly inapplicable to mathematics in its present\\r\\nform. the aristotelian doctrines of the schoolmen come nearer in\\r\\nspirit to the doctrines which modern mathematics inspire; but the\\r\\nschoolmen were hampered by the fact that their formal logic was very\\r\\ndefective, and that the philosophical logic based upon the syllogism\\r\\nshowed a corresponding narrowness. what is now required is to give the\\r\\ngreatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the\\r\\nfull the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure\\r\\nbasis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the\\r\\nexactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. if this can\\r\\nbe successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the\\r\\nnear future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the\\r\\nimmediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. great\\r\\ntriumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our\\r\\ngeneration, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a\\r\\nlevel with the greatest age of greece.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[11] this subject is due in the main to mr. c.s. peirce.\\r\\n\\r\\n[12] i ought to have added frege, but his writings were unknown to me\\r\\nwhen this article was written.

[note added in 1917.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvi\\r\\n\\r\\non scientific method in philosophy\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we try to ascertain the motives which have led men to the\\r\\ninvestigation of philosophical questions, we find that, broadly\\r\\nspeaking, they can be divided into two groups, often antagonistic, and\\r\\nleading to very divergent systems. these two groups of motives are, on\\r\\nthe one hand, those derived from religion and ethics, and, on the\\r\\nother hand, those derived from science. plato, spinoza, and hegel may\\r\\nbe taken as typical of the philosophers whose interests are mainly\\r\\nreligious and ethical, while leibniz, locke, and hume may be taken as\\r\\nrepresentatives of the scientific wing. in aristotle, descartes,\\r\\nberkeley, and kant we find both groups of motives strongly present.\\r\\n\\r\\nherbert spencer, in whose honour we are assembled to-day, would\\r\\nnaturally be classed among scientific philosophers: it was mainly from\\r\\nscience that he drew his data, his formulation of problems, and his\\r\\nconception of method. but his strong religious sense is obvious in\\r\\nmuch of his writing, and his ethical pre-occupations are what make him\\r\\nvalue the conception of evolution--that conception in which, as a\\r\\nwhole generation has believed, science and morals are to be united in\\r\\nfruitful and indissoluble marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is my belief that the ethical and religious motives in spite of\\r\\nthe splendidly imaginative systems to which they have given rise, have\\r\\nbeen on the whole a hindrance to the progress of philosophy, and ought\\r\\nnow to be consciously thrust aside by those who wish to discover\\r\\nphilosophical truth. science, originally, was entangled in similar\\r\\nmotives, and was thereby hindered in its advances. it is, i maintain,\\r\\nfrom science, rather than from ethics and religion, that philosophy\\r\\nshould draw its inspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there are two different ways in which a philosophy may seek to\\r\\nbase itself upon science. it may emphasise the most general _results_\\r\\nof science, and seek to give even greater generality and unity to\\r\\nthese results. or it may study the _methods_ of science, and seek to\\r\\napply these methods, with the necessary adaptations, to its own\\r\\npeculiar province. much philosophy inspired by science has gone astray\\r\\nthrough preoccupation with the _results_ momentarily supposed to have\\r\\nbeen achieved. it is not results, but _methods_ that can be\\r\\ntransferred with profit from the sphere of the special sciences to the\\r\\nsphere of philosophy. what i wish to bring to your notice is the\\r\\npossibility and importance of applying to philosophical problems\\r\\ncertain broad principles of method which have been found successful in\\r\\nthe study of scientific questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe opposition between a philosophy guided by scientific method and a\\r\\nphilosophy dominated by religious and ethical ideas may be illustrated\\r\\nby two notions which are very prevalent in the works of philosophers,\\r\\nnamely the notion of _the universe_, and the notion of _good and\\r\\nevil_. a philosopher is expected to tell us something about the nature\\r\\nof the universe as a whole, and to give grounds for either optimism or\\r\\npessimism. both these expectations seem to me mistaken. i believe the\\r\\nconception of \"the universe\" to be, as its etymology indicates, a\\r\\nmere relic of pre-copernican astronomy: and i believe the question of\\r\\noptimism and pessimism to be one which the philosopher will regard as\\r\\noutside his scope, except, possibly, to the extent of maintaining that\\r\\nit is insoluble.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the days before copernicus, the conception of the \"universe\" was\\r\\ndefensible on scientific grounds: the diurnal revolution of the\\r\\nheavenly bodies bound them together as all parts of one system, of\\r\\nwhich the earth was the centre. round this apparent scientific fact,\\r\\nmany human desires rallied: the wish to believe man important in the\\r\\nscheme of things, the theoretical desire for a comprehensive\\r\\nunderstanding of the whole, the hope that the course of nature might\\r\\nbe guided by some sympathy with our wishes. in this way, an ethically\\r\\ninspired system of metaphysics grew up, whose anthropocentrism was\\r\\napparently warranted by the geocentrism of astronomy. when copernicus\\r\\nswept away the astronomical basis of this system of thought, it had\\r\\ngrown so familiar, and had associated itself so intimately with men\\'s\\r\\naspirations, that it survived with scarcely diminished force--survived\\r\\neven kant\\'s \"copernican revolution,\" and is still now the unconscious\\r\\npremiss of most metaphysical systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe oneness of the world is an almost undiscussed postulate of most\\r\\nmetaphysics. \"reality is not merely one and self-consistent, but is a\\r\\nsystem of reciprocally determinate parts\"[19]--such a statement would\\r\\npass almost unnoticed as a mere truism. yet i believe that it embodies\\r\\na failure to effect thoroughly the \"copernican revolution,\" and that\\r\\nthe apparent oneness of the world is merely the oneness of what is\\r\\nseen by a single spectator or apprehended by a single mind. the\\r\\ncritical philosophy, although it intended to emphasise the subjective\\r\\nelement in many apparent characteristics of the world, yet, by\\r\\nregarding the world in itself as unknowable, so concentrated attention\\r\\nupon the subjective representation that its subjectivity was soon\\r\\nforgotten. having recognised the categories as the work of the mind,\\r\\nit was paralysed by its own recognition, and abandoned in despair the\\r\\nattempt to undo the work of subjective falsification. in part, no\\r\\ndoubt, its despair was well founded, but not, i think, in any absolute\\r\\nor ultimate sense. still less was it a ground for rejoicing, or for\\r\\nsupposing that the nescience to which it ought to have given rise\\r\\ncould be legitimately exchanged for a metaphysical dogmatism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\r\\nas regards our present question, namely, the question of the unity of\\r\\nthe world, the right method, as i think, has been indicated by william\\r\\njames.[20] \"let us now turn our backs upon ineffable or unintelligible\\r\\nways of accounting for the world\\'s oneness, and inquire whether,\\r\\ninstead of being a principle, the \\'oneness\\' affirmed may not merely be\\r\\na name like \\'substance\\' descriptive of the fact that certain _specific\\r\\nand verifiable connections_ are found among the parts of the\\r\\nexperiential flux.... we can easily conceive of things that shall have\\r\\nno connection whatever with each other. we may assume them to inhabit\\r\\ndifferent times and spaces, as the dreams of different persons do even\\r\\nnow. they may be so unlike and incommensurable, and so inert towards\\r\\none another, as never to jostle or interfere. even now there may\\r\\nactually be whole universes so disparate from ours that we who know\\r\\nours have no means of perceiving that they exist. we conceive their\\r\\ndiversity, however; and by that fact the whole lot of them form what\\r\\nis known in logic as \\'a universe of discourse.\\' to form a universe of\\r\\ndiscourse argues, as this example shows, no further kind of connexion.\\r\\nthe importance attached by certain monistic writers to the fact that\\r\\nany chaos may become a universe by merely being named, is to me\\r\\nincomprehensible.\" we are thus left with two kinds of unity in the\\r\\nexperienced world; the one what we may call the epistemological unity,\\r\\ndue merely to the fact that my experienced world is what _one_\\r\\nexperience selects from the sum total of existence: the other that\\r\\ntentative and partial unity exhibited in the prevalence of scientific\\r\\nlaws in those portions of the world which science has hitherto\\r\\nmastered. now a generalisation based upon either of these kinds of\\r\\nunity would be fallacious. that the things which we experience have\\r\\nthe common property of being experienced by us is a truism from which\\r\\nobviously nothing of importance can be deducible: it is clearly\\r\\nfallacious to draw from the fact that whatever we experience is\\r\\nexperienced the conclusion that therefore everything must be\\r\\nexperienced. the generalisation of the second kind of unity, namely,\\r\\nthat derived from scientific laws, would be equally fallacious, though\\r\\nthe fallacy is a trifle less elementary. in order to explain it let us\\r\\nconsider for a moment what is called the reign of law. people often\\r\\nspeak as though it were a remarkable fact that the physical world is\\r\\nsubject to invariable laws. in fact, however, it is not easy to see\\r\\nhow such a world could fail to obey general laws. taking any arbitrary\\r\\nset of points in space, there is a function of the time corresponding\\r\\nto these points, i.e. expressing the motion of a particle which\\r\\ntraverses these points: this function may be regarded as a general law\\r\\nto which the behaviour of such a particle is subject. taking all such\\r\\nfunctions for all the particles in the universe, there will be\\r\\ntheoretically some one formula embracing them all, and this formula\\r\\nmay be regarded as the single and supreme law of the spatio-temporal\\r\\nworld. thus what is surprising in physics is not the existence of\\r\\ngeneral laws, but their extreme simplicity. it is not the uniformity\\r\\nof nature that should surprise us, for, by sufficient analytic\\r\\ningenuity, any conceivable course of nature might be shown to exhibit\\r\\nuniformity. what should surprise us is the fact that the uniformity is\\r\\nsimple enough for us to be able to discover it. but it is just this\\r\\ncharacteristic of simplicity in the laws of nature hitherto discovered\\r\\nwhich it would be fallacious to generalise, for it is obvious that\\r\\nsimplicity has been a part cause of their discovery, and can,\\r\\ntherefore, give no ground for the supposition that other undiscovered\\r\\nlaws are equally simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fallacies to which these two kinds of unity have given rise\\r\\nsuggest a caution as regards all use in philosophy of general\\r\\n_results_ that science is supposed to have achieved. in the first\\r\\nplace, in generalising these results beyond past experience, it is\\r\\nnecessary to examine very carefully whether there is not some reason\\r\\nmaking it more probable that these results should hold of all that has\\r\\nbeen experienced than that they should hold of things universally. the\\r\\nsum total of what is experienced by mankind is a selection from the\\r\\nsum total of what exists, and any general character exhibited by this\\r\\nselection may be due to the manner of selecting rather than to the\\r\\ngeneral character of that from which experience selects. in the second\\r\\nplace, the most general results of science are the least certain and\\r\\nthe most liable to be upset by subsequent research. in utilizing these\\r\\nresults as the basis of a philosophy, we sacrifice the most valuable\\r\\nand remarkable characteristic of scientific method, namely, that,\\r\\nalthough almost everything in science is found sooner or later to\\r\\nrequire some correction, yet this correction is almost always such as\\r\\nto leave untouched, or only slightly modified, the greater part of the\\r\\nresults which have been deduced from the premiss subsequently\\r\\ndiscovered to be faulty. the prudent man of science acquires a certain\\r\\ninstinct as to the kind of uses which may be made of present\\r\\nscientific beliefs without incurring the danger of complete and utter\\r\\nrefutation from the modifications likely to be introduced by\\r\\nsubsequent discoveries. unfortunately the use of scientific\\r\\ngeneralisations of a sweeping kind as the basis of philosophy is just\\r\\nthat kind of use which an instinct of scientific caution would avoid,\\r\\nsince, as a rule, it would only lead to true results if the\\r\\ngeneralisation upon which it is based stood in _no_ need of\\r\\ncorrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may illustrate these general considerations by means of two\\r\\nexamples, namely, the conservation of energy and the principle of\\r\\nevolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) let us begin with the conservation of energy, or, as herbert\\r\\nspencer used to call it, the persistence of force. he says:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"before taking a first step in the rational interpretation of\\r\\n  evolution, it is needful to recognise, not only the facts that\\r\\n  matter is indestructible and motion continuous, but also the fact\\r\\n  that force persists. an attempt to assign the _causes_ of\\r\\n  evolution would manifestly be absurd if that agency to which the\\r\\n  metamorphosis in general and in detail is due, could either come\\r\\n  into existence or cease to exist. the succession of phenomena\\r\\n  would in such case be altogether arbitrary, and deductive science\\r\\n  impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis paragraph illustrates the kind of way in which the philosopher is\\r\\ntempted to give an air of absoluteness and necessity to empirical\\r\\ngeneralisations, of which only the approximate truth in the regions\\r\\nhitherto investigated can be guaranteed by the unaided methods of\\r\\nscience. it is very often said that the persistence of something or\\r\\nother is a necessary presupposition of all scientific investigation,\\r\\nand this presupposition is then thought to be exemplified in some\\r\\nquantity which physics declares to be constant. there are here, as it\\r\\nseems to me, three distinct errors. first, the detailed scientific\\r\\ninvestigation of nature does not _presuppose_ any such general laws as\\r\\nits results are found to verify. apart from particular observations,\\r\\nscience need presuppose nothing except the general principles of\\r\\nlogic, and these principles are not laws of nature, for they are\\r\\nmerely hypothetical, and apply not only to the actual world but to\\r\\nwhatever is _possible_. the second error consists in the\\r\\nidentification of a constant quantity with a persistent entity. energy\\r\\nis a certain function of a physical system, but is not a thing or\\r\\nsubstance persisting throughout the changes of the system. the same is\\r\\ntrue of mass, in spite of the fact that mass has often been defined as\\r\\n_quantity of matter_. the whole conception of quantity, involving, as\\r\\nit does, numerical measurement based largely upon conventions, is far\\r\\nmore artificial, far more an embodiment of mathematical convenience,\\r\\nthan is commonly believed by those who philosophise on physics. thus\\r\\neven if (which i cannot for a moment admit) the persistence of some\\r\\nentity were among the necessary postulates of science, it would be a\\r\\nsheer error to infer from this the constancy of any physical quantity,\\r\\nor the _a priori_ necessity of any such constancy which may be\\r\\nempirically discovered. in the third place, it has become more and\\r\\nmore evident with the progress of physics that large generalisations,\\r\\nsuch as the conservation of energy or mass, are far from certain and\\r\\nare very likely only approximate. mass, which used to be regarded as\\r\\nthe most indubitable of physical quantities, is now generally believed\\r\\nto vary according to velocity, and to be, in fact, a vector quantity\\r\\nwhich at a given moment is different in different directions. the\\r\\ndetailed conclusions deduced from the supposed constancy of mass for\\r\\nsuch motions as used to be studied in physics will remain very nearly\\r\\nexact, and therefore over the field of the older investigations very\\r\\nlittle modification of the older results is required. but as soon as\\r\\nsuch a principle as the conservation of mass or of energy is erected\\r\\ninto a universal _a priori_ law, the slightest failure in absolute\\r\\nexactness is fatal, and the whole philosophic structure raised upon\\r\\nthis foundation is necessarily ruined. the prudent philosopher,\\r\\ntherefore, though he may with advantage study the methods of physics,\\r\\nwill be very chary of basing anything upon what happen at the moment\\r\\nto be the most general results apparently obtained by those methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the philosophy of evolution, which was to be our second example,\\r\\nillustrates the same tendency to hasty generalisation, and also\\r\\nanother sort, namely, the undue preoccupation with ethical notions.\\r\\nthere are two kinds of evolutionist philosophy, of which both hegel\\r\\nand spencer represent the older and less radical kind, while\\r\\npragmatism and bergson represent the more modern and revolutionary\\r\\nvariety. but both these sorts of evolutionism have in common the\\r\\nemphasis on _progress_, that is, upon a continual change from the\\r\\nworse to the better, or from the simpler to the more complex. it\\r\\nwould be unfair to attribute to hegel any scientific motive or\\r\\nfoundation, but all the other evolutionists, including hegel\\'s modern\\r\\ndisciples, have derived their impetus very largely from the history of\\r\\nbiological development. to a philosophy which derives a law of\\r\\nuniversal progress from this history there are two objections. first,\\r\\nthat this history itself is concerned with a very small selection of\\r\\nfacts confined to an infinitesimal fragment of space and time, and\\r\\neven on scientific grounds probably not an average sample of events in\\r\\nthe world at large. for we know that decay as well as growth is a\\r\\nnormal occurrence in the world. an extra-terrestrial philosopher, who\\r\\nhad watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never\\r\\ncome across any other human being, might conclude that it is the\\r\\nnature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an\\r\\nindefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalisation would\\r\\nbe just as well founded as the generalisation which evolutionists base\\r\\nupon the previous history of this planet. apart, however, from this\\r\\nscientific objection to evolutionism, there is another, derived from\\r\\nthe undue admixture of ethical notions in the very idea of progress\\r\\nfrom which evolutionism derives its charm. organic life, we are told,\\r\\nhas developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and\\r\\nthis development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance.\\r\\nunfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us\\r\\nthis assurance, and we can have no security that the impartial\\r\\noutsider would agree with the philosopher\\'s self-complacent\\r\\nassumption. this point has been illustrated by the philosopher chuang\\r\\ntz in the following instructive anecdote:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"the grand augur, in his ceremonial robes, approached the shambles\\r\\n  and thus addressed the pigs: \\'how can you object to die? i shall\\r\\n  fatten you for three months. i shall discipline myself for ten\\r\\n  days and fast for three. i shall strew fine grass, and place you\\r\\n  bodily upon a carved sacrificial dish. does not this satisfy you?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  then, speaking from the pigs\\' point of view, he continued: \\'it is\\r\\n  better, perhaps, after all, to live on bran and escape the\\r\\n  shambles....\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\'but then,\\' added he, speaking from his own point of view, \\'to\\r\\n  enjoy honour when alive one would readily die on a war-shield or\\r\\n  in the headsman\\'s basket.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  so he rejected the pigs\\' point of view and adopted his own point\\r\\n  of view. in what sense, then, was he different from the pigs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni much fear that the evolutionists too often resemble the grand augur\\r\\nand the pigs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe ethical element which has been prominent in many of the most\\r\\nfamous systems of philosophy is, in my opinion, one of the most\\r\\nserious obstacles to the victory of scientific method in the\\r\\ninvestigation of philosophical questions. human ethical notions, as\\r\\nchuang tz perceived, are essentially anthropocentric, and involve,\\r\\nwhen used in metaphysics, an attempt, however veiled, to legislate for\\r\\nthe universe on the basis of the present desires of men. in this way\\r\\nthey interfere with that receptivity to fact which is the essence of\\r\\nthe scientific attitude towards the world. to regard ethical notions\\r\\nas a key to the understanding of the world is essentially\\r\\npre-copernican. it is to make man, with the hopes and ideals which he\\r\\nhappens to have at the present moment, the centre of the universe and\\r\\nthe interpreter of its supposed aims and purposes. ethical metaphysics\\r\\nis fundamentally an attempt, however disguised, to give legislative\\r\\nforce to our own wishes. this may, of course, be questioned, but i\\r\\nthink that it is confirmed by a consideration of the way in which\\r\\nethical notions arise. ethics is essentially a product of the\\r\\ngregarious instinct, that is to say, of the instinct to co-operate\\r\\nwith those who are to form our own group against those who belong to\\r\\nother groups. those who belong to our own group are good; those who\\r\\nbelong to hostile groups are wicked. the ends which are pursued by our\\r\\nown group are desirable ends, the ends pursued by hostile groups are\\r\\nnefarious. the subjectivity of this situation is not apparent to the\\r\\ngregarious animal, which feels that the general principles of justice\\r\\nare on the side of its own herd. when the animal has arrived at the\\r\\ndignity of the metaphysician, it invents ethics as the embodiment of\\r\\nits belief in the justice of its own herd. so the grand augur invokes\\r\\nethics as the justification of augurs in their conflicts with pigs.\\r\\nbut, it may be said, this view of ethics takes no account of such\\r\\ntruly ethical notions as that of self-sacrifice. this, however, would\\r\\nbe a mistake. the success of gregarious animals in the struggle for\\r\\nexistence depends upon co-operation within the herd, and co-operation\\r\\nrequires sacrifice, to some extent, of what would otherwise be the\\r\\ninterest of the individual. hence arises a conflict of desires and\\r\\ninstincts, since both self-preservation and the preservation of the\\r\\nherd are biological ends to the individual. ethics is in origin the\\r\\nart of recommending to others the sacrifices required for co-operation\\r\\nwith oneself. hence, by reflexion, it comes, through the operation of\\r\\nsocial justice, to recommend sacrifices by oneself, but all ethics,\\r\\nhowever refined, remains more or less subjective. even vegetarians do\\r\\nnot hesitate, for example, to save the life of a man in a fever,\\r\\nalthough in doing so they destroy the lives of many millions of\\r\\nmicrobes. the view of the world taken by the philosophy derived from\\r\\nethical notions is thus never impartial and therefore never fully\\r\\nscientific. as compared with science, it fails to achieve the\\r\\nimaginative liberation from self which is necessary to such\\r\\nunderstanding of the world as man can hope to achieve, and the\\r\\nphilosophy which it inspires is always more or less parochial, more or\\r\\nless infected with the prejudices of a time and a place.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not deny the importance or value, within its own sphere, of the\\r\\nkind of philosophy which is inspired by ethical notions. the ethical\\r\\nwork of spinoza, for example, appears to me of the very highest\\r\\nsignificance, but what is valuable in such work is not any\\r\\nmetaphysical theory as to the nature of the world to which it may give\\r\\nrise, nor indeed anything which can be proved or disproved by\\r\\nargument. what is valuable is the indication of some new way of\\r\\nfeeling towards life and the world, some way of feeling by which our\\r\\nown existence can acquire more of the characteristics which we must\\r\\ndeeply desire. the value of such work, however immeasurable it is,\\r\\nbelongs with practice and not with theory. such theoretic importance\\r\\nas it may possess is only in relation to human nature, not in relation\\r\\nto the world at large. the scientific philosophy, therefore, which\\r\\naims only at understanding the world and not directly at any other\\r\\nimprovement of human life, cannot take account of ethical notions\\r\\nwithout being turned aside from that submission to fact which is the\\r\\nessence of the scientific temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nii\\r\\n\\r\\nif the notion of the universe and the notion of good and evil are\\r\\nextruded from scientific philosophy, it may be asked what specific\\r\\nproblems remain for the philosopher as opposed to the man of science?\\r\\nit would be difficult to give a precise answer to this question, but\\r\\ncertain characteristics may be noted as distinguishing the province of\\r\\nphilosophy from that of the special sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the first place a philosophical proposition must be general. it\\r\\nmust not deal specially with things on the surface of the earth, or\\r\\nwith the solar system, or with any other portion of space and time. it\\r\\nis this need of generality which has led to the belief that philosophy\\r\\ndeals with the universe as a whole. i do not believe that this belief\\r\\nis justified, but i do believe that a philosophical proposition must\\r\\nbe applicable to everything that exists or may exist. it might be\\r\\nsupposed that this admission would be scarcely distinguishable from\\r\\nthe view which i wish to reject. this, however, would be an error, and\\r\\nan important one. the traditional view would make the universe itself\\r\\nthe subject of various predicates which could not be applied to any\\r\\nparticular thing in the universe, and the ascription of such peculiar\\r\\npredicates to the universe would be the special business of\\r\\nphilosophy. i maintain, on the contrary, that there are no\\r\\npropositions of which the \"universe\" is the subject; in other words,\\r\\nthat there is no such thing as the \"universe.\" what i do maintain is\\r\\nthat there are general propositions which may be asserted of each\\r\\nindividual thing, such as the propositions of logic. this does not\\r\\ninvolve that all the things there are form a whole which could be\\r\\nregarded as another thing and be made the subject of predicates. it\\r\\ninvolves only the assertion that there are properties which belong to\\r\\neach separate thing, not that there are properties belonging to the\\r\\nwhole of things collectively. the philosophy which i wish to advocate\\r\\nmay be called logical atomism or absolute pluralism, because, while\\r\\nmaintaining that there are many things, it denies that there is a\\r\\nwhole composed of those things. we shall see, therefore, that\\r\\nphilosophical propositions, instead of being concerned with the whole\\r\\nof things collectively, are concerned with all things distributively;\\r\\nand not only must they be concerned with all things, but they must be\\r\\nconcerned with such properties of all things as do not depend upon the\\r\\naccidental nature of the things that there happen to be, but are true\\r\\nof any possible world, independently of such facts as can only be\\r\\ndiscovered by our senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis brings us to a second characteristic of philosophical\\r\\npropositions, namely, that they must be _a priori_. a philosophical\\r\\nproposition must be such as can be neither proved nor disproved by\\r\\nempirical evidence. too often we find in philosophical books arguments\\r\\nbased upon the course of history, or the convolutions of the brain, or\\r\\nthe eyes of shell-fish. special and accidental facts of this kind are\\r\\nirrelevant to philosophy, which must make only such assertions as\\r\\nwould be equally true however the actual world were constituted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may sum up these two characteristics of philosophical propositions\\r\\nby saying that _philosophy is the science of the possible_. but this\\r\\nstatement unexplained is liable to be misleading, since it may be\\r\\nthought that the possible is something other than the general, whereas\\r\\nin fact the two are indistinguishable.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy, if what has been said is correct, becomes indistinguishable\\r\\nfrom logic as that word has now come to be used. the study of logic\\r\\nconsists, broadly speaking, of two not very sharply distinguished\\r\\nportions. on the one hand it is concerned with those general statements\\r\\nwhich can be made concerning everything without mentioning any one\\r\\nthing or predicate or relation, such for example as \"if _x_ is a member\\r\\nof the class  and every member of  is a member of , then _x_ is a\\r\\nmember of the class , whatever _x_, , and  may be.\" on the other\\r\\nhand, it is concerned with the analysis and enumeration of logical\\r\\n_forms_, i.e. with the kinds of propositions that may occur, with the\\r\\nvarious types of facts, and with the classification of the constituents\\r\\nof facts. in this way logic provides an inventory of possibilities, a\\r\\nrepertory of abstractly tenable hypotheses.\\r\\n\\r\\nit might be thought that such a study would be too vague and too\\r\\ngeneral to be of any very great importance, and that, if its problems\\r\\nbecame at any point sufficiently definite, they would be merged in the\\r\\nproblems of some special science. it appears, however, that this is\\r\\nnot the case. in some problems, for example, the analysis of space and\\r\\ntime, the nature of perception, or the theory of judgment, the\\r\\ndiscovery of the logical form of the facts involved is the hardest\\r\\npart of the work and the part whose performance has been most lacking\\r\\nhitherto. it is chiefly for want of the right logical hypothesis that\\r\\nsuch problems have hitherto been treated in such an unsatisfactory\\r\\nmanner, and have given rise to those contradictions or antinomies in\\r\\nwhich the enemies of reason among philosophers have at all times\\r\\ndelighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nby concentrating attention upon the investigation of logical forms, it\\r\\nbecomes possible at last for philosophy to deal with its problems\\r\\npiecemeal, and to obtain, as the sciences do, such partial and\\r\\nprobably not wholly correct results as subsequent investigation can\\r\\nutilise even while it supplements and improves them. most\\r\\nphilosophies hitherto have been constructed all in one block, in such\\r\\na way that, if they were not wholly correct, they were wholly\\r\\nincorrect, and could not be used as a basis for further\\r\\ninvestigations. it is chiefly owing to this fact that philosophy,\\r\\nunlike science, has hitherto been unprogressive, because each original\\r\\nphilosopher has had to begin the work again from the beginning,\\r\\nwithout being able to accept anything definite from the work of his\\r\\npredecessors. a scientific philosophy such as i wish to recommend will\\r\\nbe piecemeal and tentative like other sciences; above all, it will be\\r\\nable to invent hypotheses which, even if they are not wholly true,\\r\\nwill yet remain fruitful after the necessary corrections have been\\r\\nmade. this possibility of successive approximations to the truth is,\\r\\nmore than anything else, the source of the triumphs of science, and to\\r\\ntransfer this possibility to philosophy is to ensure a progress in\\r\\nmethod whose importance it would be almost impossible to exaggerate.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe essence of philosophy as thus conceived is analysis, not\\r\\nsynthesis. to build up systems of the world, like heine\\'s german\\r\\nprofessor who knit together fragments of life and made an intelligible\\r\\nsystem out of them, is not, i believe, any more feasible than the\\r\\ndiscovery of the philosopher\\'s stone. what is feasible is the\\r\\nunderstanding of general forms, and the division of traditional\\r\\nproblems into a number of separate and less baffling questions.\\r\\n\"divide and conquer\" is the maxim of success here as elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us illustrate these somewhat general maxims by examining their\\r\\napplication to the philosophy of space, for it is only in application\\r\\nthat the meaning or importance of a method can be understood. suppose\\r\\nwe are confronted with the problem of space as presented in kant\\'s\\r\\ntranscendental sthetic, and suppose we wish to discover what are the\\r\\nelements of the problem and what hope there is of obtaining a solution\\r\\nof them. it will soon appear that three entirely distinct problems,\\r\\nbelonging to different studies, and requiring different methods for\\r\\ntheir solution, have been confusedly combined in the supposed single\\r\\nproblem with which kant is concerned. there is a problem of logic, a\\r\\nproblem of physics, and a problem of theory of knowledge. of these\\r\\nthree, the problem of logic can be solved exactly and perfectly; the\\r\\nproblem of physics can probably be solved with as great a degree of\\r\\ncertainty and as great an approach to exactness as can be hoped in an\\r\\nempirical region; the problem of theory of knowledge, however, remains\\r\\nvery obscure and very difficult to deal with. let us see how these\\r\\nthree problems arise.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the logical problem has arisen through the suggestions of\\r\\nnon-euclidean geometry. given a body of geometrical propositions, it\\r\\nis not difficult to find a minimum statement of the axioms from which\\r\\nthis body of propositions can be deduced. it is also not difficult, by\\r\\ndropping or altering some of these axioms, to obtain a more general or\\r\\na different geometry, having, from the point of view of pure\\r\\nmathematics, the same logical coherence and the same title to respect\\r\\nas the more familiar euclidean geometry. the euclidean geometry itself\\r\\nis true perhaps of actual space (though this is doubtful), but\\r\\ncertainly of an infinite number of purely arithmetical systems, each\\r\\nof which, from the point of view of abstract logic, has an equal and\\r\\nindefeasible right to be called a euclidean space. thus space as an\\r\\nobject of logical or mathematical study loses its uniqueness; not only\\r\\nare there many kinds of spaces, but there are an infinity of examples\\r\\nof each kind, though it is difficult to find any kind of which the\\r\\nspace of physics may be an example, and it is impossible to find any\\r\\nkind of which the space of physics is certainly an example. as an\\r\\nillustration of one possible logical system of geometry we may\\r\\nconsider all relations of three terms which are analogous in certain\\r\\nformal respects to the relation \"between\" as it appears to be in\\r\\nactual space. a space is then defined by means of one such three-term\\r\\nrelation. the points of the space are all the terms which have this\\r\\nrelation to something or other, and their order in the space in\\r\\nquestion is determined by this relation. the points of one space are\\r\\nnecessarily also points of other spaces, since there are necessarily\\r\\nother three-term relations having those same points for their field.\\r\\nthe space in fact is not determined by the class of its points, but by\\r\\nthe ordering three-term relation. when enough abstract logical\\r\\nproperties of such relations have been enumerated to determine the\\r\\nresulting kind of geometry, say, for example, euclidean geometry, it\\r\\nbecomes unnecessary for the pure geometer in his abstract capacity to\\r\\ndistinguish between the various relations which have all these\\r\\nproperties. he considers the whole class of such relations, not any\\r\\nsingle one among them. thus in studying a given kind of geometry the\\r\\npure mathematician is studying a certain class of relations defined by\\r\\nmeans of certain abstract logical properties which take the place of\\r\\nwhat used to be called axioms. the nature of geometrical _reasoning_\\r\\ntherefore is purely deductive and purely logical; if any special\\r\\nepistemological peculiarities are to be found in geometry, it must not\\r\\nbe in the reasoning, but in our knowledge concerning the axioms in\\r\\nsome given space.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the physical problem of space is both more interesting and more\\r\\ndifficult than the logical problem. the physical problem may be\\r\\nstated as follows: to find in the physical world, or to construct from\\r\\nphysical materials, a space of one of the kinds enumerated by the\\r\\nlogical treatment of geometry. this problem derives its difficulty\\r\\nfrom the attempt to accommodate to the roughness and vagueness of the\\r\\nreal world some system possessing the logical clearness and exactitude\\r\\nof pure mathematics. that this can be done with a certain degree of\\r\\napproximation is fairly evident if i see three people _a_, _b_, and\\r\\n_c_ sitting in a row, i become aware of the fact which may be\\r\\nexpressed by saying that _b_ is between _a_ and _c_ rather than that\\r\\n_a_ is between _b_ and _c_, or _c_ is between _a_ and _b_. this\\r\\nrelation of \"between\" which is thus perceived to hold has some of the\\r\\nabstract logical properties of those three-term relations which, we\\r\\nsaw, give rise to a geometry, but its properties fail to be exact, and\\r\\nare not, as empirically given, amenable to the kind of treatment at\\r\\nwhich geometry aims. in abstract geometry we deal with points,\\r\\nstraight lines, and planes; but the three people _a_, _b_, and _c_\\r\\nwhom i see sitting in a row are not exactly points, nor is the row\\r\\nexactly a straight line. nevertheless physics, which formally assumes\\r\\na space containing points, straight lines, and planes, is found\\r\\nempirically to give results applicable to the sensible world. it must\\r\\ntherefore be possible to find an interpretation of the points,\\r\\nstraight lines, and planes of physics in terms of physical data, or at\\r\\nany rate in terms of data together with such hypothetical additions as\\r\\nseem least open to question. since all data suffer from a lack of\\r\\nmathematical precision through being of a certain size and somewhat\\r\\nvague in outline, it is plain that if such a notion as that of a point\\r\\nis to find any application to empirical material, the point must be\\r\\nneither a datum nor a hypothetical addition to data, but a\\r\\n_construction_ by means of data with their hypothetical additions. it\\r\\nis obvious that any hypothetical filling out of data is less dubious\\r\\nand unsatisfactory when the additions are closely analogous to data\\r\\nthan when they are of a radically different sort. to assume, for\\r\\nexample, that objects which we see continue, after we have turned away\\r\\nour eyes, to be more or less analogous to what they were while we were\\r\\nlooking, is a less violent assumption than to assume that such objects\\r\\nare composed of an infinite number of mathematical points. hence in\\r\\nthe physical study of the geometry of physical space, points must not\\r\\nbe assumed _ab initio_ as they are in the logical treatment of\\r\\ngeometry, but must be constructed as systems composed of data and\\r\\nhypothetical analogues of data. we are thus led naturally to define a\\r\\nphysical point as a certain class of those objects which are the\\r\\nultimate constituents of the physical world. it will be the class of\\r\\nall those objects which, as one would naturally say, _contain_ the\\r\\npoint. to secure a definition giving this result, without previously\\r\\nassuming that physical objects are composed of points, is an agreeable\\r\\nproblem in mathematical logic. the solution of this problem and the\\r\\nperception of its importance are due to my friend dr. whitehead. the\\r\\noddity of regarding a point as a class of physical entities wears off\\r\\nwith familiarity, and ought in any case not to be felt by those who\\r\\nmaintain, as practically every one does, that points are mathematical\\r\\nfictions. the word \"fiction\" is used glibly in such connexions by many\\r\\nmen who seem not to feel the necessity of explaining how it can come\\r\\nabout that a fiction can be so useful in the study of the actual world\\r\\nas the points of mathematical physics have been found to be. by our\\r\\ndefinition, which regards a point as a class of physical objects, it\\r\\nis explained both how the use of points can lead to important\\r\\nphysical results, and how we can nevertheless avoid the assumption\\r\\nthat points are themselves entities in the physical world.\\r\\n\\r\\nmany of the mathematically convenient properties of abstract logical\\r\\nspaces cannot be either known to belong or known not to belong to the\\r\\nspace of physics. such are all the properties connected with continuity.\\r\\nfor to know that actual space has these properties would require an\\r\\ninfinite exactness of sense-perception. if actual space is continuous,\\r\\nthere are nevertheless many possible non-continuous spaces which will be\\r\\nempirically indistinguishable from it; and, conversely, actual space may\\r\\nbe non-continuous and yet empirically indistinguishable from a possible\\r\\ncontinuous space. continuity, therefore, though obtainable in the _a\\r\\npriori_ region of arithmetic, is not with certainty obtainable in the\\r\\nspace or time of the physical world: whether these are continuous or not\\r\\nwould seem to be a question not only unanswered but for ever\\r\\nunanswerable. from the point of view of philosophy, however, the\\r\\ndiscovery that a question is unanswerable is as complete an answer as\\r\\nany that could possibly be obtained. and from the point of view of\\r\\nphysics, where no empirical means of distinction can be found, there can\\r\\nbe no empirical objection to the mathematically simplest assumption,\\r\\nwhich is that of continuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe subject of the physical theory of space is a very large one,\\r\\nhitherto little explored. it is associated with a similar theory of\\r\\ntime, and both have been forced upon the attention of philosophically\\r\\nminded physicists by the discussions which have raged concerning the\\r\\ntheory of relativity.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) the problem with which kant is concerned in the transcendental\\r\\nsthetic is primarily the epistemological problem: \"how do we come to\\r\\nhave knowledge of geometry _a priori_?\" by the distinction between the\\r\\nlogical and physical problems of geometry, the bearing and scope of\\r\\nthis question are greatly altered. our knowledge of pure geometry is\\r\\n_a priori_ but is wholly logical. our knowledge of physical geometry\\r\\nis synthetic, but is not _a priori_. our knowledge of pure geometry is\\r\\nhypothetical, and does not enable us to assert, for example, that the\\r\\naxiom of parallels is true in the physical world. our knowledge of\\r\\nphysical geometry, while it does enable us to assert that this axiom\\r\\nis approximately verified, does not, owing to the inevitable\\r\\ninexactitude of observation, enable us to assert that it is verified\\r\\n_exactly_. thus, with the separation which we have made between pure\\r\\ngeometry and the geometry of physics, the kantian problem collapses.\\r\\nto the question, \"how is synthetic _a priori_ knowledge possible?\" we\\r\\ncan now reply, at any rate so far as geometry is concerned, \"it is not\\r\\npossible,\" if \"synthetic\" means \"not deducible from logic alone.\" our\\r\\nknowledge of geometry, like the rest of our knowledge, is derived\\r\\npartly from logic, partly from sense, and the peculiar position which\\r\\nin kant\\'s day geometry appeared to occupy is seen now to be a\\r\\ndelusion. there are still some philosophers, it is true, who maintain\\r\\nthat our knowledge that the axiom of parallels, for example, is true\\r\\nof actual space, is not to be accounted for empirically, but is as\\r\\nkant maintained derived from an _a priori_ intuition. this position is\\r\\nnot logically refutable, but i think it loses all plausibility as soon\\r\\nas we realise how complicated and derivative is the notion of physical\\r\\nspace. as we have seen, the application of geometry to the physical\\r\\nworld in no way demands that there should really be points and\\r\\nstraight lines among physical entities. the principle of economy,\\r\\ntherefore, demands that we should abstain from assuming the existence\\r\\nof points and straight lines. as soon, however, as we accept the view\\r\\nthat points and straight lines are complicated constructions by means\\r\\nof classes of physical entities, the hypothesis that we have an _a\\r\\npriori_ intuition enabling us to know what happens to straight lines\\r\\nwhen they are produced indefinitely becomes extremely strained and\\r\\nharsh; nor do i think that such an hypothesis would ever have arisen\\r\\nin the mind of a philosopher who had grasped the nature of physical\\r\\nspace. kant, under the influence of newton, adopted, though with some\\r\\nvacillation, the hypothesis of absolute space, and this hypothesis,\\r\\nthough logically unobjectionable, is removed by occam\\'s razor, since\\r\\nabsolute space is an unnecessary entity in the explanation of the\\r\\nphysical world. although, therefore, we cannot refute the kantian\\r\\ntheory of an _a priori_ intuition, we can remove its grounds one by\\r\\none through an analysis of the problem. thus, here as in many other\\r\\nphilosophical questions, the analytic method, while not capable of\\r\\narriving at a demonstrative result, is nevertheless capable of showing\\r\\nthat all the positive grounds in favour of a certain theory are\\r\\nfallacious and that a less unnatural theory is capable of accounting\\r\\nfor the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother question by which the capacity of the analytic method can be\\r\\nshown is the question of realism. both those who advocate and those\\r\\nwho combat realism seem to me to be far from clear as to the nature of\\r\\nthe problem which they are discussing. if we ask: \"are our objects of\\r\\nperception _real_ and are they _independent_ of the percipient?\" it\\r\\nmust be supposed that we attach some meaning to the words \"real\" and\\r\\n\"independent,\" and yet, if either side in the controversy of realism\\r\\nis asked to define these two words, their answer is pretty sure to\\r\\nembody confusions such as logical analysis will reveal.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us begin with the word \"real.\" there certainly are objects of\\r\\nperception, and therefore, if the question whether these objects are\\r\\nreal is to be a substantial question, there must be in the world two\\r\\nsorts of objects, namely, the real and the unreal, and yet the unreal\\r\\nis supposed to be essentially what there is not. the question what\\r\\nproperties must belong to an object in order to make it real is one to\\r\\nwhich an adequate answer is seldom if ever forthcoming. there is of\\r\\ncourse the hegelian answer, that the real is the self-consistent and\\r\\nthat nothing is self-consistent except the whole; but this answer,\\r\\ntrue or false, is not relevant in our present discussion, which moves\\r\\non a lower plane and is concerned with the status of objects of\\r\\nperception among other objects of equal fragmentariness. objects of\\r\\nperception are contrasted, in the discussions concerning realism,\\r\\nrather with psychical states on the one hand and matter on the other\\r\\nhand than with the all-inclusive whole of things. the question we have\\r\\ntherefore to consider is the question as to what can be meant by\\r\\nassigning \"reality\" to some but not all of the entities that make up\\r\\nthe world. two elements, i think, make up what is felt rather than\\r\\nthought when the word \"reality\" is used in this sense. a thing is real\\r\\nif it persists at times when it is not perceived; or again, a thing is\\r\\nreal when it is correlated with other things in a way which experience\\r\\nhas led us to expect. it will be seen that reality in either of these\\r\\nsenses is by no means necessary to a thing, and that in fact there\\r\\nmight be a whole world in which nothing was real in either of these\\r\\nsenses. it might turn out that the objects of perception failed of\\r\\nreality in one or both of these respects, without its being in any way\\r\\ndeducible that they are not parts of the external world with which\\r\\nphysics deals. similar remarks will apply to the word \"independent.\"\\r\\nmost of the associations of this word are bound up with ideas as to\\r\\ncausation which it is not now possible to maintain. _a_ is independent\\r\\nof _b_ when _b_ is not an indispensable part of the _cause_ of _a_.\\r\\nbut when it is recognised that causation is nothing more than\\r\\ncorrelation, and that there are correlations of simultaneity as well\\r\\nas of succession, it becomes evident that there is no uniqueness in a\\r\\nseries of casual antecedents of a given event, but that, at any point\\r\\nwhere there is a correlation of simultaneity, we can pass from one\\r\\nline of antecedents to another in order to obtain a new series of\\r\\ncausal antecedents. it will be necessary to specify the causal law\\r\\naccording to which the antecedents are to be considered. i received a\\r\\nletter the other day from a correspondent who had been puzzled by\\r\\nvarious philosophical questions. after enumerating them he says:\\r\\n\"these questions led me from bonn to strassburg, where i found\\r\\nprofessor simmel.\" now, it would be absurd to deny that these\\r\\nquestions caused his body to move from bonn to strassburg, and yet it\\r\\nmust be supposed that a set of purely mechanical antecedents could\\r\\nalso be found which would account for this transfer of matter from one\\r\\nplace to another. owing to this plurality of causal series antecedent\\r\\nto a given event, the notion of _the_ cause becomes indefinite, and\\r\\nthe question of independence becomes correspondingly ambiguous. thus,\\r\\ninstead of asking simply whether _a_ is independent of _b_, we ought\\r\\nto ask whether there is a series determined by such and such causal\\r\\nlaws leading from _b_ to _a_. this point is important in connexion\\r\\nwith the particular question of objects of perception. it may be that\\r\\nno objects quite like those which we perceive ever exist unperceived;\\r\\nin this case there will be a causal law according to which objects of\\r\\nperception are not independent of being perceived. but even if this be\\r\\nthe case, it may nevertheless also happen that there are purely\\r\\nphysical causal laws determining the occurrence of objects which are\\r\\nperceived by means of other objects which perhaps are not perceived.\\r\\nin that case, in regard to such causal laws objects of perception will\\r\\nbe independent of being perceived. thus the question whether objects\\r\\nof perception are independent of being perceived is, as it stands,\\r\\nindeterminate, and the answer will be yes or no according to the\\r\\nmethod adopted of making it determinate. i believe that this confusion\\r\\nhas borne a very large part in prolonging the controversies on this\\r\\nsubject, which might well have seemed capable of remaining for ever\\r\\nundecided. the view which i should wish to advocate is that objects of\\r\\nperception do not persist unchanged at times when they are not\\r\\nperceived, although probably objects more or less resembling them do\\r\\nexist at such times; that objects of perception are part, and the only\\r\\nempirically knowable part, of the actual subject-matter of physics,\\r\\nand are themselves properly to be called physical; that purely\\r\\nphysical laws exist determining the character and duration of objects\\r\\nof perception without any reference to the fact that they are\\r\\nperceived; and that in the establishment of such laws the propositions\\r\\nof physics do not presuppose any propositions of psychology or even\\r\\nthe existence of mind. i do not know whether realists would recognise\\r\\nsuch a view as realism. all that i should claim for it is, that it\\r\\navoids difficulties which seem to me to beset both realism and\\r\\nidealism as hitherto advocated, and that it avoids the appeal which\\r\\nthey have made to ideas which logical analysis shows to be ambiguous.\\r\\na further defence and elaboration of the positions which i advocate,\\r\\nbut for which time is lacking now, will be found indicated in my book\\r\\non _our knowledge of the external world_.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe adoption of scientific method in philosophy, if i am not mistaken,\\r\\ncompels us to abandon the hope of solving many of the more ambitious\\r\\nand humanly interesting problems of traditional philosophy. some of\\r\\nthese it relegates, though with little expectation of a successful\\r\\nsolution, to special sciences, others it shows to be such as our\\r\\ncapacities are essentially incapable of solving. but there remain a\\r\\nlarge number of the recognised problems of philosophy in regard to\\r\\nwhich the method advocated gives all those advantages of division into\\r\\ndistinct questions, of tentative, partial, and progressive advance,\\r\\nand of appeal to principles with which, independently of temperament,\\r\\nall competent students must agree. the failure of philosophy hitherto\\r\\nhas been due in the main to haste and ambition: patience and modesty,\\r\\nhere as in other sciences, will open the road to solid and durable\\r\\nprogress.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[19] bosanquet, _logic_, ii, p. 211.\\r\\n\\r\\n[20] _some problems of philosophy_, p 124.\\r\\n\\r\\n[21] _first principles_ (1862), part ii,

article no less a question than the ancient\\r\\nmetaphysical query, \"what is matter?\" the question, \"what is matter?\"\\r\\nin so far as it concerns philosophy, is, i think, already capable of\\r\\nan answer which in principle will be as complete as an answer can hope\\r\\nto be; that is to say, we can separate the problem into an essentially\\r\\nsoluble and an essentially insoluble portion, and we can now see how\\r\\nto solve the essentially soluble portion, at least as regards its main\\r\\noutlines. it is these outlines which i wish to suggest in the present\\r\\narticle. my main position, which is realistic, is, i hope and believe,\\r\\nnot remote from that of professor alexander, by whose writings on this\\r\\nsubject i have profited greatly.[24] it is also in close accord with\\r\\nthat of dr. nunn.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\ncommon sense is accustomed to the division of the world into mind and\\r\\nmatter. it is supposed by all who have never studied philosophy that\\r\\nthe distinction between mind and matter is perfectly clear and easy,\\r\\nthat the two do not at any point overlap, and that only a fool or a\\r\\nphilosopher could be in doubt as to whether any given entity is mental\\r\\nor material. this simple faith survives in descartes and in a\\r\\nsomewhat modified form in spinoza, but with leibniz it begins to\\r\\ndisappear, and from his day to our own almost every philosopher of\\r\\nnote has criticised and rejected the dualism of common sense. it is my\\r\\nintention in this article to defend this dualism; but before defending\\r\\nit we must spend a few moments on the reasons which have prompted its\\r\\nrejection.\\r\\n\\r\\nour knowledge of the material world is obtained by means of the\\r\\nsenses, of sight and touch and so on. at first it is supposed that\\r\\nthings are just as they seem, but two opposite sophistications soon\\r\\ndestroy this nave belief. on the one hand the physicists cut up\\r\\nmatter into molecules, atoms, corpuscles, and as many more such\\r\\nsubdivisions as their future needs may make them postulate, and the\\r\\nunits at which they arrive are uncommonly different from the visible,\\r\\ntangible objects of daily life. a unit of matter tends more and more\\r\\nto be something like an electromagnetic field filling all space,\\r\\nthough having its greatest intensity in a small region. matter\\r\\nconsisting of such elements is as remote from daily life as any\\r\\nmetaphysical theory. it differs from the theories of metaphysicians\\r\\nonly in the fact that its practical efficacy proves that it contains\\r\\nsome measure of truth and induces business men to invest money on the\\r\\nstrength of it; but, in spite of its connection with the money market,\\r\\nit remains a metaphysical theory none the less.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second kind of sophistication to which the world of common sense\\r\\nhas been subjected is derived from the psychologists and\\r\\nphysiologists. the physiologists point out that what we see depends\\r\\nupon the eye, that what we hear depends upon the ear, and that all our\\r\\nsenses are liable to be affected by anything which affects the brain,\\r\\nlike alcohol or hasheesh. psychologists point out how much of what we\\r\\nthink we see is supplied by association or unconscious inference, how\\r\\nmuch is mental interpretation, and how doubtful is the residuum which\\r\\ncan be regarded as crude datum. from these facts it is argued by the\\r\\npsychologists that the notion of a datum passively received by the\\r\\nmind is a delusion, and it is argued by the physiologists that even if\\r\\na pure datum of sense could be obtained by the analysis of experience,\\r\\nstill this datum could not belong, as common sense supposes, to the\\r\\nouter world, since its whole nature is conditioned by our nerves and\\r\\nsense organs, changing as they change in ways which it is thought\\r\\nimpossible to connect with any change in the matter supposed to be\\r\\nperceived. this physiologist\\'s argument is exposed to the rejoinder,\\r\\nmore specious than solid, that our knowledge of the existence of the\\r\\nsense organs and nerves is obtained by that very process which the\\r\\nphysiologist has been engaged in discrediting, since the existence of\\r\\nthe nerves and sense organs is only known through the evidence of the\\r\\nsenses themselves. this argument may prove that some reinterpretation\\r\\nof the results of physiology is necessary before they can acquire\\r\\nmetaphysical validity. but it does not upset the physiological\\r\\nargument in so far as this constitutes merely a _reductio ad absurdum_\\r\\nof nave realism.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese various lines of argument prove, i think, that some part of the\\r\\nbeliefs of common sense must be abandoned. they prove that, if we take\\r\\nthese beliefs as a whole, we are forced into conclusions which are in\\r\\npart self-contradictory; but such arguments cannot of themselves\\r\\ndecide what portion of our common-sense beliefs is in need of\\r\\ncorrection. common sense believes that what we see is physical,\\r\\noutside the mind, and continuing to exist if we shut our eyes or turn\\r\\nthem in another direction. i believe that common sense is right in\\r\\nregarding what we see as physical and (in one of several possible\\r\\nsenses) outside the mind, but is probably wrong in supposing that it\\r\\ncontinues to exist when we are no longer looking at it. it seems to me\\r\\nthat the whole discussion of matter has been obscured by two errors\\r\\nwhich support each other. the first of these is the error that what we\\r\\nsee, or perceive through any of our other senses, is subjective: the\\r\\nsecond is the belief that what is physical must be persistent.\\r\\nwhatever physics may regard as the ultimate constituents of matter, it\\r\\nalways supposes these constituents to be indestructible. since the\\r\\nimmediate data of sense are not indestructible but in a state of\\r\\nperpetual flux, it is argued that these data themselves cannot be\\r\\namong the ultimate constituents of matter. i believe this to be a\\r\\nsheer mistake. the persistent particles of mathematical physics i\\r\\nregard as logical constructions, symbolic fictions enabling us to\\r\\nexpress compendiously very complicated assemblages of facts; and, on\\r\\nthe other hand, i believe that the actual data in sensation, the\\r\\nimmediate objects of sight or touch or hearing, are extra-mental,\\r\\npurely physical, and among the ultimate constituents of matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy meaning in regard to the impermanence of physical entities may\\r\\nperhaps be made clearer by the use of bergson\\'s favourite illustration\\r\\nof the cinematograph. when i first read bergson\\'s statement that the\\r\\nmathematician conceives the world after the analogy of a\\r\\ncinematograph, i had never seen a cinematograph, and my first visit to\\r\\none was determined by the desire to verify bergson\\'s statement, which\\r\\ni found to be completely true, at least so far as i am concerned.\\r\\nwhen, in a picture palace, we see a man rolling down hill, or running\\r\\naway from the police, or falling into a river, or doing any of those\\r\\nother things to which men in such places are addicted, we know that\\r\\nthere is not really only one man moving, but a succession of films,\\r\\neach with a different momentary man. the illusion of persistence\\r\\narises only through the approach to continuity in the series of\\r\\nmomentary men. now what i wish to suggest is that in this respect the\\r\\ncinema is a better metaphysician than common sense, physics, or\\r\\nphilosophy. the real man too, i believe, however the police may swear\\r\\nto his identity, is really a series of momentary men, each different\\r\\none from the other, and bound together, not by a numerical identity,\\r\\nbut by continuity and certain intrinsic causal laws. and what applies\\r\\nto men applies equally to tables and chairs, the sun, moon and stars.\\r\\neach of these is to be regarded, not as one single persistent entity,\\r\\nbut as a series of entities succeeding each other in time, each\\r\\nlasting for a very brief period, though probably not for a mere\\r\\nmathematical instant. in saying this i am only urging the same kind of\\r\\ndivision in time as we are accustomed to acknowledge in the case of\\r\\nspace. a body which fills a cubic foot will be admitted to consist of\\r\\nmany smaller bodies, each occupying only a very tiny volume; similarly\\r\\na thing which persists for an hour is to be regarded as composed of\\r\\nmany things of less duration. a true theory of matter requires a\\r\\ndivision of things into time-corpuscles as well as into\\r\\nspace-corpuscles.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe world may be conceived as consisting of a multitude of entities\\r\\narranged in a certain pattern. the entities which are arranged i shall\\r\\ncall \"particulars.\" the arrangement or pattern results from relations\\r\\namong particulars. classes or series of particulars, collected\\r\\ntogether on account of some property which makes it convenient to be\\r\\nable to speak of them as wholes, are what i call logical constructions\\r\\nor symbolic fictions. the particulars are to be conceived, not on the\\r\\nanalogy of bricks in a building, but rather on the analogy of notes\\r\\nin a symphony. the ultimate constituents of a symphony (apart from\\r\\nrelations) are the notes, each of which lasts only for a very short\\r\\ntime. we may collect together all the notes played by one instrument:\\r\\nthese may be regarded as the analogues of the successive particulars\\r\\nwhich common sense would regard as successive states of one \"thing.\"\\r\\nbut the \"thing\" ought to be regarded as no more \"real\" or\\r\\n\"substantial\" than, for example, the rle of the trombone. as soon as\\r\\n\"things\" are conceived in this manner it will be found that the\\r\\ndifficulties in the way of regarding immediate objects of sense as\\r\\nphysical have largely disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen people ask, \"is the object of sense mental or physical?\" they\\r\\nseldom have any clear idea either what is meant by \"mental\" or\\r\\n\"physical,\" or what criteria are to be applied for deciding whether a\\r\\ngiven entity belongs to one class or the other. i do not know how to\\r\\ngive a sharp definition of the word \"mental,\" but something may be\\r\\ndone by enumerating occurrences which are indubitably mental:\\r\\nbelieving, doubting, wishing, willing, being pleased or pained, are\\r\\ncertainly mental occurrences; so are what we may call experiences,\\r\\nseeing, hearing, smelling, perceiving generally. but it does not\\r\\nfollow from this that what is seen, what is heard, what is smelt, what\\r\\nis perceived, must be mental. when i see a flash of lightning, my\\r\\nseeing of it is mental, but what i see, although it is not quite the\\r\\nsame as what anybody else sees at the same moment, and although it\\r\\nseems very unlike what the physicist would describe as a flash of\\r\\nlightning, is not mental. i maintain, in fact, that if the physicist\\r\\ncould describe truly and fully all that occurs in the physical world\\r\\nwhen there is a flash of lightning, it would contain as a constituent\\r\\nwhat i see, and also what is seen by anybody else who would commonly\\r\\nbe said to see the same flash. what i mean may perhaps be made plainer\\r\\nby saying that if my body could remain in exactly the same state in\\r\\nwhich it is, although my mind had ceased to exist, precisely that\\r\\nobject which i now see when i see the flash would exist, although of\\r\\ncourse i should not see it, since my seeing is mental. the principal\\r\\nreasons which have led people to reject this view have, i think, been\\r\\ntwo: first, that they did not adequately distinguish between my seeing\\r\\nand what i see; secondly, that the causal dependence of what i see\\r\\nupon my body has made people suppose that what i see cannot be\\r\\n\"outside\" me. the first of these reasons need not detain us, since the\\r\\nconfusion only needs to be pointed out in order to be obviated; but\\r\\nthe second requires some discussion, since it can only be answered by\\r\\nremoving current misconceptions, on the one hand as to the nature of\\r\\nspace, and on the other, as to the meaning of causal dependence.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen people ask whether colours, for example, or other secondary\\r\\nqualities are inside or outside the mind, they seem to suppose that\\r\\ntheir meaning must be clear, and that it ought to be possible to say\\r\\nyes or no without any further discussion of the terms involved. in\\r\\nfact, however, such terms as \"inside\" or \"outside\" are very ambiguous.\\r\\nwhat is meant by asking whether this or that is \"in\" the mind? the\\r\\nmind is not like a bag or a pie; it does not occupy a certain region\\r\\nin space, or, if (in a sense) it does, what is in that region is\\r\\npresumably part of the brain, which would not be said to be in the\\r\\nmind. when people say that sensible qualities are in the mind, they do\\r\\nnot mean \"spatially contained in\" in the sense in which the blackbirds\\r\\nwere in the pie. we might regard the mind as an assemblage of\\r\\nparticulars, namely, what would be called \"states of mind,\" which\\r\\nwould belong together in virtue of some specific common quality. the\\r\\ncommon quality of all states of mind would be the quality designated\\r\\nby the word \"mental\"; and besides this we should have to suppose that\\r\\neach separate person\\'s states of mind have some common characteristic\\r\\ndistinguishing them from the states of mind of other people. ignoring\\r\\nthis latter point, let us ask ourselves whether the quality designated\\r\\nby the word \"mental\" does, as a matter of observation, actually belong\\r\\nto objects of sense, such as colours or noises. i think any candid\\r\\nperson must reply that, however difficult it may be to know what we\\r\\nmean by \"mental,\" it is not difficult to see that colours and noises\\r\\nare not mental in the sense of having that intrinsic peculiarity which\\r\\nbelongs to beliefs and wishes and volitions, but not to the physical\\r\\nworld. berkeley advances on this subject a plausible argument[26]\\r\\nwhich seems to me to rest upon an ambiguity in the word \"pain.\" he\\r\\nargues that the realist supposes the heat which he feels in\\r\\napproaching a fire to be something outside his mind, but that as he\\r\\napproaches nearer and nearer to the fire the sensation of heat passes\\r\\nimperceptibly into pain, and that no one could regard pain as\\r\\nsomething outside the mind. in reply to this argument, it should be\\r\\nobserved in the first place that the heat of which we are immediately\\r\\naware is not in the fire but in our own body. it is only by inference\\r\\nthat the fire is judged to be the cause of the heat which we feel in\\r\\nour body. in the second place (and this is the more important point),\\r\\nwhen we speak of pain we may mean one of two things: we may mean the\\r\\nobject of the sensation or other experience which has the quality of\\r\\nbeing painful, or we may mean the quality of painfulness itself. when\\r\\na man says he has a pain in his great toe, what he means is that he\\r\\nhas a sensation associated with his great toe and having the quality\\r\\nof painfulness. the sensation itself, like every sensation, consists\\r\\nin experiencing a sensible object, and the experiencing has that\\r\\nquality of painfulness which only mental occurrences can have, but\\r\\nwhich may belong to thoughts or desires, as well as to sensations. but\\r\\nin common language we speak of the sensible object experienced in a\\r\\npainful sensation as a pain, and it is this way of speaking which\\r\\ncauses the confusion upon which the plausibility of berkeley\\'s\\r\\nargument depends. it would be absurd to attribute the quality of\\r\\npainfulness to anything non-mental, and hence it comes to be thought\\r\\nthat what we call a pain in the toe must be mental. in fact, however,\\r\\nit is not the sensible object in such a case which is painful, but the\\r\\nsensation, that is to say, the experience of the sensible object. as\\r\\nthe heat which we experience from the fire grows greater, the\\r\\nexperience passes gradually from being pleasant to being painful, but\\r\\nneither the pleasure nor the pain is a quality of the object\\r\\nexperienced as opposed to the experience, and it is therefore a\\r\\nfallacy to argue that this object must be mental on the ground that\\r\\npainfulness can only be attributed to what is mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nif, then, when we say that something is in the mind we mean that it\\r\\nhas a certain recognisable intrinsic characteristic such as belongs to\\r\\nthoughts and desires, it must be maintained on grounds of immediate\\r\\ninspection that objects of sense are not in any mind.\\r\\n\\r\\na different meaning of \"in the mind\" is, however, to be inferred from\\r\\nthe arguments advanced by those who regard sensible objects as being\\r\\nin the mind. the arguments used are, in the main, such as would prove\\r\\nthe causal dependence of objects of sense upon the percipient. now\\r\\nthe notion of causal dependence is very obscure and difficult, much\\r\\nmore so in fact than is generally realised by philosophers. i shall\\r\\nreturn to this point in a moment. for the present, however, accepting\\r\\nthe notion of causal dependence without criticism, i wish to urge that\\r\\nthe dependence in question is rather upon our bodies than upon our\\r\\nminds. the visual appearance of an object is altered if we shut one\\r\\neye, or squint, or look previously at something dazzling; but all\\r\\nthese are bodily acts, and the alterations which they effect are to be\\r\\nexplained by physiology and optics, not by psychology.[27] they are in\\r\\nfact of exactly the same kind as the alterations effected by\\r\\nspectacles or a microscope. they belong therefore to the theory of the\\r\\nphysical world, and can have no bearing upon the question whether what\\r\\nwe see is causally dependent upon the mind. what they do tend to\\r\\nprove, and what i for my part have no wish to deny, is that what we\\r\\nsee is causally dependent upon our body and is not, as crude common\\r\\nsense would suppose, something which would exist equally if our eyes\\r\\nand nerves and brain were absent, any more than the visual appearance\\r\\npresented by an object seen through a microscope would remain if the\\r\\nmicroscope were removed. so long as it is supposed that the physical\\r\\nworld is composed of stable and more or less permanent constituents,\\r\\nthe fact that what we see is changed by changes in our body appears to\\r\\nafford reason for regarding what we see as not an ultimate constituent\\r\\nof matter. but if it is recognised that the ultimate constituents of\\r\\nmatter are as circumscribed in duration as in spatial extent, the\\r\\nwhole of this difficulty vanishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere remains, however, another difficulty, connected with space. when\\r\\nwe look at the sun we wish to know something about the sun itself,\\r\\nwhich is ninety-three million miles away; but what we see is dependent\\r\\nupon our eyes, and it is difficult to suppose that our eyes can affect\\r\\nwhat happens at a distance of ninety-three million miles. physics\\r\\ntells us that certain electromagnetic waves start from the sun, and\\r\\nreach our eyes after about eight minutes. they there produce\\r\\ndisturbances in the rods and cones, thence in the optic nerve, thence\\r\\nin the brain. at the end of this purely physical series, by some odd\\r\\nmiracle, comes the experience which we call \"seeing the sun,\" and it\\r\\nis such experiences which form the whole and sole reason for our\\r\\nbelief in the optic nerve, the rods and cones, the ninety-three\\r\\nmillion miles, the electromagnetic waves, and the sun itself. it is\\r\\nthis curious oppositeness of direction between the order of causation\\r\\nas affirmed by physics, and the order of evidence as revealed by\\r\\ntheory of knowledge, that causes the most serious perplexities in\\r\\nregard to the nature of physical reality. anything that invalidates\\r\\nour seeing, as a source of knowledge concerning physical reality,\\r\\ninvalidates also the whole of physics and physiology. and yet,\\r\\nstarting from a common-sense acceptance of our seeing, physics has\\r\\nbeen led step by step to the construction of the causal chain in which\\r\\nour seeing is the last link, and the immediate object which we see\\r\\ncannot be regarded as that initial cause which we believe to be\\r\\nninety-three million miles away, and which we are inclined to regard\\r\\nas the \"real\" sun.\\r\\n\\r\\ni have stated this difficulty as forcibly as i can, because i believe\\r\\nthat it can only be answered by a radical analysis and reconstruction\\r\\nof all the conceptions upon whose employment it depends.\\r\\n\\r\\nspace, time, matter and cause, are the chief of these conceptions. let\\r\\nus begin with the conception of cause.\\r\\n\\r\\ncausal dependence, as i observed a moment ago, is a conception which\\r\\nit is very dangerous to accept at its face value. there exists a\\r\\nnotion that in regard to any event there is something which may be\\r\\ncalled _the_ cause of that event--some one definite occurrence,\\r\\nwithout which the event would have been impossible and with which it\\r\\nbecomes necessary. an event is supposed to be dependent upon its cause\\r\\nin some way which in it is not dependent upon other things. thus men\\r\\nwill urge that the mind is dependent upon the brain, or, with equal\\r\\nplausibility, that the brain is dependent upon the mind. it seems not\\r\\nimprobable that if we had sufficient knowledge we could infer the\\r\\nstate of a man\\'s mind from the state of his brain, or the state of his\\r\\nbrain from the state of his mind. so long as the usual conception of\\r\\ncausal dependence is retained, this state of affairs can be used by\\r\\nthe materialist to urge that the state of our brain causes our\\r\\nthoughts, and by the idealist to urge that our thoughts cause the\\r\\nstate of our brain. either contention is equally valid or equally\\r\\ninvalid. the fact seems to be that there are many correlations of the\\r\\nsort which may be called causal, and that, for example, either a\\r\\nphysical or a mental event can be predicted, theoretically, either\\r\\nfrom a sufficient number of physical antecedents or from a sufficient\\r\\nnumber of mental antecedents. to speak of _the_ cause of an event is\\r\\ntherefore misleading. any set of antecedents from which the event can\\r\\ntheoretically be inferred by means of correlations might be called a\\r\\ncause of the event. but to speak of _the_ cause is to imply a\\r\\nuniqueness which does not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe relevance of this to the experience which we call \"seeing the sun\"\\r\\nis obvious. the fact that there exists a chain of antecedents which\\r\\nmakes our seeing dependent upon the eyes and nerves and brain does not\\r\\neven tend to show that there is not another chain of antecedents in\\r\\nwhich the eyes and nerves and brain as physical things are ignored. if\\r\\nwe are to escape from the dilemma which seemed to arise out of the\\r\\nphysiological causation of what we see when we say we see the sun, we\\r\\nmust find, at least in theory, a way of stating causal laws for the\\r\\nphysical world, in which the units are not material things, such as\\r\\nthe eyes and nerves and brain, but momentary particulars of the same\\r\\nsort as our momentary visual object when we look at the sun. the sun\\r\\nitself and the eyes and nerves and brain must be regarded as\\r\\nassemblages of momentary particulars. instead of supposing, as we\\r\\nnaturally do when we start from an uncritical acceptance of the\\r\\napparent dicta of physics, that _matter_ is what is \"really real\" in\\r\\nthe physical world, and that the immediate objects of sense are mere\\r\\nphantasms, we must regard matter as a logical construction, of which\\r\\nthe constituents will be just such evanescent particulars as may, when\\r\\nan observer happens to be present, become data of sense to that\\r\\nobserver. what physics regards as the sun of eight minutes ago will be\\r\\na whole assemblage of particulars, existing at different times,\\r\\nspreading out from a centre with the velocity of light, and containing\\r\\namong their number all those visual data which are seen by people who\\r\\nare now looking at the sun. thus the sun of eight minutes ago is a\\r\\nclass of particulars, and what i see when i now look at the sun is one\\r\\nmember of this class. the various particulars constituting this class\\r\\nwill be correlated with each other by a certain continuity and certain\\r\\nintrinsic laws of variation as we pass outwards from the centre,\\r\\ntogether with certain modifications correlated extrinsically with\\r\\nother particulars which are not members of this class. it is these\\r\\nextrinsic modifications which represent the sort of facts that, in our\\r\\nformer account, appeared as the influence of the eyes and nerves in\\r\\nmodifying the appearance of the sun.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe _prima facie_ difficulties in the way of this view are chiefly\\r\\nderived from an unduly conventional theory of space. it might seem at\\r\\nfirst sight as if we had packed the world much fuller than it could\\r\\npossibly hold. at every place between us and the sun, we said, there\\r\\nis to be a particular which is to be a member of the sun as it was a\\r\\nfew minutes ago. there will also, of course, have to be a particular\\r\\nwhich is a member of any planet or fixed star that may happen to be\\r\\nvisible from that place. at the place where i am, there will be\\r\\nparticulars which will be members severally of all the \"things\" i am\\r\\nnow said to be perceiving. thus throughout the world, everywhere,\\r\\nthere will be an enormous number of particulars coexisting in the same\\r\\nplace. but these troubles result from contenting ourselves too readily\\r\\nwith the merely three-dimensional space to which schoolmasters have\\r\\naccustomed us. the space of the real world is a space of six\\r\\ndimensions, and as soon as we realise this we see that there is plenty\\r\\nof room for all the particulars for which we want to find positions.\\r\\nin order to realise this we have only to return for a moment from the\\r\\npolished space of physics to the rough and untidy space of our\\r\\nimmediate sensible experience. the space of one man\\'s sensible objects\\r\\nis a three-dimensional space. it does not appear probable that two men\\r\\never both perceive at the same time any one sensible object; when they\\r\\nare said to see the same thing or hear the same noise, there will\\r\\nalways be some difference, however slight, between the actual shapes\\r\\nseen or the actual sounds heard. if this is so, and if, as is\\r\\ngenerally assumed, position in space is purely relative, it follows\\r\\nthat the space of one man\\'s objects and the space of another man\\'s\\r\\nobjects have no place in common, that they are in fact different\\r\\nspaces, and not merely different parts of one space. i mean by this\\r\\nthat such immediate spatial relations as are perceived to hold\\r\\nbetween the different parts of the sensible space perceived by one\\r\\nman, do not hold between parts of sensible spaces perceived by\\r\\ndifferent men. there are therefore a multitude of three-dimensional\\r\\nspaces in the world: there are all those perceived by observers, and\\r\\npresumably also those which are not perceived, merely because no\\r\\nobserver is suitably situated for perceiving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut although these spaces do not have to one another the same kind of\\r\\nspatial relations as obtain between the parts of one of them, it is\\r\\nnevertheless possible to arrange these spaces themselves in a\\r\\nthree-dimensional order. this is done by means of the correlated\\r\\nparticulars which we regard as members (or aspects) of one physical\\r\\nthing. when a number of people are said to see the same object, those\\r\\nwho would be said to be near to the object see a particular occupying\\r\\na larger part of their field of vision than is occupied by the\\r\\ncorresponding particular seen by people who would be said to be\\r\\nfarther from the thing. by means of such considerations it is\\r\\npossible, in ways which need not now be further specified, to arrange\\r\\nall the different spaces in a three-dimensional series. since each of\\r\\nthe spaces is itself three-dimensional, the whole world of particulars\\r\\nis thus arranged in a six-dimensional space, that is to say, six\\r\\nco-ordinates will be required to assign completely the position of any\\r\\ngiven particular, namely, three to assign its position in its own\\r\\nspace and three more to assign the position of its space among the\\r\\nother spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two ways of classifying particulars: we may take together\\r\\nall those that belong to a given \"perspective,\" or all those that are,\\r\\nas common sense would say, different \"aspects\" of the same \"thing.\"\\r\\nfor example, if i am (as is said) seeing the sun, what i see belongs\\r\\nto two assemblages: (1) the assemblage of all my present objects of\\r\\nsense, which is what i call a \"perspective\"; (2) the assemblage of\\r\\nall the different particulars which would be called aspects of the sun\\r\\nof eight minutes ago--this assemblage is what i define as _being_ the\\r\\nsun of eight minutes ago. thus \"perspectives\" and \"things\" are merely\\r\\ntwo different ways of classifying particulars. it is to be observed\\r\\nthat there is no _a priori_ necessity for particulars to be\\r\\nsusceptible of this double classification. there may be what might be\\r\\ncalled \"wild\" particulars, not having the usual relations by which the\\r\\nclassification is effected; perhaps dreams and hallucinations are\\r\\ncomposed of particulars which are \"wild\" in this sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe exact definition of what is meant by a perspective is not quite\\r\\neasy. so long as we confine ourselves to visible objects or to objects\\r\\nof touch we might define the perspective of a given particular as \"all\\r\\nparticulars which have a simple (direct) spatial relation to the given\\r\\nparticular.\" between two patches of colour which i see now, there is a\\r\\ndirect spatial relation which i equally see. but between patches of\\r\\ncolour seen by different men there is only an indirect constructed\\r\\nspatial relation by means of the placing of \"things\" in physical space\\r\\n(which is the same as the space composed of perspectives). those\\r\\nparticulars which have direct spatial relations to a given particular\\r\\nwill belong to the same perspective. but if, for example, the sounds\\r\\nwhich i hear are to belong to the same perspective with the patches of\\r\\ncolour which i see, there must be particulars which have no direct\\r\\nspatial relation and yet belong to the same perspective. we cannot\\r\\ndefine a perspective as all the data of one percipient at one time,\\r\\nbecause we wish to allow the possibility of perspectives which are not\\r\\nperceived by any one. there will be need, therefore, in defining a\\r\\nperspective, of some principle derived neither from psychology nor\\r\\nfrom space.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch a principle may be obtained from the consideration of _time_.\\r\\nthe one all-embracing time, like the one all-embracing space, is a\\r\\nconstruction; there is no _direct_ time-relation between particulars\\r\\nbelonging to my perspective and particulars belonging to another\\r\\nman\\'s. on the other hand, any two particulars of which i am aware are\\r\\neither simultaneous or successive, and their simultaneity or\\r\\nsuccessiveness is sometimes itself a datum to me. we may therefore\\r\\ndefine the perspective to which a given particular belongs as \"all\\r\\nparticulars simultaneous with the given particular,\" where\\r\\n\"simultaneous\" is to be understood as a direct simple relation, not\\r\\nthe derivative constructed relation of physics. it may be observed\\r\\nthat the introduction of \"local time\" suggested by the principle of\\r\\nrelativity has effected, for purely scientific reasons, much the same\\r\\nmultiplication of times as we have just been advocating.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe sum-total of all the particulars that are (directly) either\\r\\nsimultaneous with or before or after a given particular may be defined\\r\\nas the \"biography\" to which that particular belongs. it will be\\r\\nobserved that, just as a perspective need not be actually perceived by\\r\\nany one, so a biography need not be actually lived by any one. those\\r\\nbiographies that are lived by no one are called \"official.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe definition of a \"thing\" is effected by means of continuity and of\\r\\ncorrelations which have a certain differential independence of other\\r\\n\"things.\" that is to say, given a particular in one perspective, there\\r\\nwill usually in a neighbouring perspective be a very similar\\r\\nparticular, differing from the given particular, to the first order of\\r\\nsmall quantities, according to a law involving only the difference of\\r\\nposition of the two perspectives in perspective space, and not any of\\r\\nthe other \"things\" in the universe. it is this continuity and\\r\\ndifferential independence in the law of change as we pass from one\\r\\nperspective to another that defines the class of particulars which is\\r\\nto be called \"one thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbroadly speaking, we may say that the physicist finds it convenient to\\r\\nclassify particulars into \"things,\" while the psychologist finds it\\r\\nconvenient to classify them into \"perspectives\" and \"biographies,\"\\r\\nsince one perspective _may_ constitute the momentary data of one\\r\\npercipient, and one biography _may_ constitute the whole of the data\\r\\nof one percipient throughout his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now sum up our discussion. our object has been to discover as\\r\\nfar as possible the nature of the ultimate constituents of the\\r\\nphysical world. when i speak of the \"physical world,\" i mean, to begin\\r\\nwith, the world dealt with by physics. it is obvious that physics is\\r\\nan empirical science, giving us a certain amount of knowledge and\\r\\nbased upon evidence obtained through the senses. but partly through\\r\\nthe development of physics itself, partly through arguments derived\\r\\nfrom physiology, psychology or metaphysics, it has come to be thought\\r\\nthat the immediate data of sense could not themselves form part of the\\r\\nultimate constituents of the physical world, but were in some sense\\r\\n\"mental,\" \"in the mind,\" or \"subjective.\" the grounds for this view,\\r\\nin so far as they depend upon physics, can only be adequately dealt\\r\\nwith by rather elaborate constructions depending upon symbolic logic,\\r\\nshowing that out of such materials as are provided by the senses it is\\r\\npossible to construct classes and series having the properties which\\r\\nphysics assigns to matter. since this argument is difficult and\\r\\ntechnical, i have not embarked upon it in this article. but in so far\\r\\nas the view that sense-data are \"mental\" rests upon physiology,\\r\\npsychology, or metaphysics, i have tried to show that it rests upon\\r\\nconfusions and prejudices--prejudices in favour of permanence in the\\r\\nultimate constituents of matter, and confusions derived from unduly\\r\\nsimple notions as to space, from the causal correlation of sense-data\\r\\nwith sense-organs, and from failure to distinguish between sense-data\\r\\nand sensations. if what we have said on these subjects is valid, the\\r\\nexistence of sense-data is logically independent of the existence of\\r\\nmind, and is causally dependent upon the _body_ of the percipient\\r\\nrather than upon his mind. the causal dependence upon the body of the\\r\\npercipient, we found, is a more complicated matter than it appears to\\r\\nbe, and, like all causal dependence, is apt to give rise to erroneous\\r\\nbeliefs through misconceptions as to the nature of causal correlation.\\r\\nif we have been right in our contentions, sense-data are merely those\\r\\namong the ultimate constituents of the physical world, of which we\\r\\nhappen to be immediately aware; they themselves are purely physical,\\r\\nand all that is mental in connection with them is our awareness of\\r\\nthem, which is irrelevant to their nature and to their place in\\r\\nphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nunduly simple notions as to space have been a great stumbling-block to\\r\\nrealists. when two men look at the same table, it is supposed that\\r\\nwhat the one sees and what the other sees are in the same place. since\\r\\nthe shape and colour are not quite the same for the two men, this\\r\\nraises a difficulty, hastily solved, or rather covered up, by\\r\\ndeclaring what each sees to be purely \"subjective\"--though it would\\r\\npuzzle those who use this glib word to say what they mean by it. the\\r\\ntruth seems to be that space--and time also--is much more complicated\\r\\nthan it would appear to be from the finished structure of physics, and\\r\\nthat the one all-embracing three-dimensional space is a logical\\r\\nconstruction, obtained by means of correlations from a crude space of\\r\\nsix dimensions. the particulars occupying this six-dimensional space,\\r\\nclassified in one way, form \"things,\" from which with certain further\\r\\nmanipulations we can obtain what physics can regard as matter;\\r\\nclassified in another way, they form \"perspectives\" and \"biographies,\"\\r\\nwhich may, if a suitable percipient happens to exist, form\\r\\nrespectively the sense-data of a momentary or of a total experience.\\r\\nit is only when physical \"things\" have been dissected into series of\\r\\nclasses of particulars, as we have done, that the conflict between the\\r\\npoint of view of physics and the point of view of psychology can be\\r\\novercome. this conflict, if what has been said is not mistaken, flows\\r\\nfrom different methods of classification, and vanishes as soon as its\\r\\nsource is discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nin favour of the theory which i have briefly outlined, i do not claim\\r\\nthat it is _certainly_ true. apart from the likelihood of mistakes,\\r\\nmuch of it is avowedly hypothetical. what i do claim for the theory is\\r\\nthat it _may_ be true, and that this is more than can be said for any\\r\\nother theory except the closely analogous theory of leibniz. the\\r\\ndifficulties besetting realism, the confusions obstructing any\\r\\nphilosophical account of physics, the dilemma resulting from\\r\\ndiscrediting sense-data, which yet remain the sole source of our\\r\\nknowledge of the outer world--all these are avoided by the theory\\r\\nwhich i advocate. this does not prove the theory to be true, since\\r\\nprobably many other theories might be invented which would have the\\r\\nsame merits. but it does prove that the theory has a better chance of\\r\\nbeing true than any of its present competitors, and it suggests that\\r\\nwhat can be known with certainty is likely to be discoverable by\\r\\ntaking our theory as a starting-point, and gradually freeing it from\\r\\nall such assumptions as seem irrelevant, unnecessary, or unfounded. on\\r\\nthese grounds, i recommend it to attention as a hypothesis and a basis\\r\\nfor further work, though not as itself a finished or adequate solution\\r\\nof the problem with which it deals.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[23] an address delivered to the philosophical society of manchester\\r\\nin february, 1915. reprinted from _the monist_, july, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\n[24] cf.

sense-data to physics\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni. the problem stated\\r\\n\\r\\nphysics is said to be an empirical science, based upon observation and\\r\\nexperiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is supposed to be verifiable, i.e. capable of calculating\\r\\nbeforehand results subsequently confirmed by observation and\\r\\nexperiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat can we learn by observation and experiment?\\r\\n\\r\\nnothing, so far as physics is concerned, except immediate data of\\r\\nsense: certain patches of colour, sounds, tastes, smells, etc., with\\r\\ncertain spatio-temporal relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe supposed contents of the physical world are _prima facie_ very\\r\\ndifferent from these: molecules have no colour, atoms make no noise,\\r\\nelectrons have no taste, and corpuscles do not even smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nif such objects are to be verified, it must be solely through their\\r\\nrelation to sense-data: they must have some kind of correlation with\\r\\nsense-data, and must be verifiable through their correlation _alone_.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut how is the correlation itself ascertained? a correlation can only\\r\\nbe ascertained empirically by the correlated objects being constantly\\r\\n_found_ together. but in our case, only one term of the correlation,\\r\\nnamely, the sensible term, is ever _found_: the other term seems\\r\\nessentially incapable of being found. therefore, it would seem, the\\r\\ncorrelation with objects of sense, by which physics was to be\\r\\nverified, is itself utterly and for ever unverifiable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two ways of avoiding this result.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) we may say that we know some principle _a priori_, without the\\r\\nneed of empirical verification, e.g. that our sense-data have _causes_\\r\\nother than themselves, and that something can be known about these\\r\\ncauses by inference from their effects. this way has been often\\r\\nadopted by philosophers. it may be necessary to adopt this way to some\\r\\nextent, but in so far as it is adopted physics ceases to be empirical\\r\\nor based upon experiment and observation alone. therefore this way is\\r\\nto be avoided as much as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) we may succeed in actually defining the objects of physics as\\r\\nfunctions of sense-data. just in so far as physics leads to\\r\\nexpectations, this _must_ be possible, since we can only _expect_ what\\r\\ncan be experienced. and in so far as the physical state of affairs is\\r\\ninferred from sense-data, it must be capable of expression as a\\r\\nfunction of sense-data. the problem of accomplishing this expression\\r\\nleads to much interesting logico-mathematical work.\\r\\n\\r\\nin physics as commonly set forth, sense-data appear as functions of\\r\\nphysical objects: when such-and-such waves impinge upon the eye, we\\r\\nsee such-and-such colours, and so on. but the waves are in fact\\r\\ninferred from the colours, not vice versa. physics cannot be regarded\\r\\nas validly based upon empirical data until the waves have been\\r\\nexpressed as functions of the colours and other sense-data.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus if physics is to be verifiable we are faced with the following\\r\\nproblem: physics exhibits sense-data as functions of physical objects,\\r\\nbut verification is only possible if physical objects can be exhibited\\r\\nas functions of sense-data. we have therefore to solve the equations\\r\\ngiving sense-data in terms of physical objects, so as to make them\\r\\ninstead give physical objects in terms of sense-data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nii. characteristics of sense-data\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i speak of a \"sense-datum,\" i do not mean the whole of what is\\r\\ngiven in sense at one time. i mean rather such a part of the whole as\\r\\nmight be singled out by attention: particular patches of colour,\\r\\nparticular noises, and so on. there is some difficulty in deciding\\r\\nwhat is to be considered _one_ sense-datum: often attention causes\\r\\ndivisions to appear where, so far as can be discovered, there were no\\r\\ndivisions before. an observed complex fact, such as that this patch of\\r\\nred is to the left of that patch of blue, is also to be regarded as a\\r\\ndatum from our present point of view: epistemologically, it does not\\r\\ndiffer greatly from a simple sense-datum as regards its function in\\r\\ngiving knowledge. its _logical_ structure is very different, however,\\r\\nfrom that of sense: _sense_ gives acquaintance with particulars, and\\r\\nis thus a two-term relation in which the object can be _named_ but not\\r\\n_asserted_, and is inherently incapable of truth or falsehood, whereas\\r\\nthe observation of a complex fact, which may be suitably called\\r\\nperception, is not a two-term relation, but involves the propositional\\r\\nform on the object-side, and gives knowledge of a truth, not mere\\r\\nacquaintance with a particular. this logical difference, important as\\r\\nit is, is not very relevant to our present problem; and it will be\\r\\nconvenient to regard data of perception as included among sense-data\\r\\nfor the purposes of this paper. it is to be observed that the\\r\\nparticulars which are constituents of a datum of perception are always\\r\\nsense-data in the strict sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nconcerning sense-data, we know that they are there while they are\\r\\ndata, and this is the epistemological basis of all our knowledge of\\r\\nexternal particulars. (the meaning of the word \"external\" of course\\r\\nraises problems which will concern us later.) we do not know, except\\r\\nby means of more or less precarious inferences, whether the objects\\r\\nwhich are at one time sense-data continue to exist at times when they\\r\\nare not data. sense-data at the times when they are data are all that\\r\\nwe directly and primitively know of the external world; hence in\\r\\nepistemology the fact that they are _data_ is all-important. but the\\r\\nfact that they are all that we directly know gives, of course, no\\r\\npresumption that they are all that there is. if we could construct an\\r\\nimpersonal metaphysic, independent of the accidents of our knowledge\\r\\nand ignorance, the privileged position of the actual data would\\r\\nprobably disappear, and they would probably appear as a rather\\r\\nhaphazard selection from a mass of objects more or less like them. in\\r\\nsaying this, i assume only that it is probable that there are\\r\\nparticulars with which we are not acquainted. thus the special\\r\\nimportance of sense-data is in relation to epistemology, not to\\r\\nmetaphysics. in this respect, physics is to be reckoned as\\r\\nmetaphysics: it is impersonal, and nominally pays no special attention\\r\\nto sense-data. it is only when we ask how physics can be _known_ that\\r\\nthe importance of sense-data re-emerges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niii. sensibilia\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall give the name _sensibilia_ to those objects which have the\\r\\nsame metaphysical and physical status as sense-data, without\\r\\nnecessarily being data to any mind. thus the relation of a _sensibile_\\r\\nto a sense-datum is like that of a man to a husband: a man becomes a\\r\\nhusband by entering into the relation of marriage, and similarly a\\r\\n_sensibile_ becomes a sense-datum by entering into the relation of\\r\\nacquaintance. it is important to have both terms; for we wish to\\r\\ndiscuss whether an object which is at one time a sense-datum can still\\r\\nexist at a time when it is not a sense-datum. we cannot ask \"can\\r\\nsense-data exist without being given?\" for that is like asking \"can\\r\\nhusbands exist without being married?\" we must ask \"can _sensibilia_\\r\\nexist without being given?\" and also \"can a particular _sensibile_ be\\r\\nat one time a sense-datum, and at another not?\" unless we have the\\r\\nword _sensibile_ as well as the word \"sense-datum,\" such questions are\\r\\napt to entangle us in trivial logical puzzles.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that all sense-data are _sensibilia_. it is a\\r\\nmetaphysical question whether all _sensibilia_ are sense-data, and an\\r\\nepistemological question whether there exist means of inferring\\r\\n_sensibilia_ which are not data from those that are.\\r\\n\\r\\na few preliminary remarks, to be amplified as we proceed, will serve\\r\\nto elucidate the use which i propose to make of _sensibilia_.\\r\\n\\r\\ni regard sense-data as not mental, and as being, in fact, part of the\\r\\nactual subject-matter of physics. there are arguments, shortly to be\\r\\nexamined, for their subjectivity, but these arguments seem to me only\\r\\nto prove _physiological_ subjectivity, i.e. causal dependence on the\\r\\nsense-organs, nerves, and brain. the appearance which a thing presents\\r\\nto us is causally dependent upon these, in exactly the same way as it\\r\\nis dependent upon intervening fog or smoke or coloured glass. both\\r\\ndependences are contained in the statement that the appearance which a\\r\\npiece of matter presents when viewed from a given place is a function\\r\\nnot only of the piece of matter, but also of the intervening medium.\\r\\n(the terms used in this statement--\"matter,\" \"view from a given\\r\\nplace,\" \"appearance,\" \"intervening medium\"--will all be defined in the\\r\\ncourse of the present paper.) we have not the means of ascertaining\\r\\nhow things appear from places not surrounded by brain and nerves and\\r\\nsense-organs, because we cannot leave the body; but continuity makes\\r\\nit not unreasonable to suppose that they present _some_ appearance at\\r\\nsuch places. any such appearance would be included among _sensibilia_.\\r\\nif--_per impossibile_--there were a complete human body with no mind\\r\\ninside it, all those _sensibilia_ would exist, in relation to that\\r\\nbody, which would be sense-data if there were a mind in the body. what\\r\\nthe mind adds to _sensibilia_, in fact, is _merely_ awareness:\\r\\neverything else is physical or physiological.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niv. sense-data are physical\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore discussing this question it will be well to define the sense in\\r\\nwhich the terms \"mental\" and \"physical\" are to be used. the word\\r\\n\"physical,\" in all preliminary discussions, is to be understood as\\r\\nmeaning \"what is dealt with by physics.\" physics, it is plain, tells\\r\\nus something about some of the constituents of the actual world; what\\r\\nthese constituents are may be doubtful, but it is they that are to be\\r\\ncalled physical, whatever their nature may prove to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe definition of the term \"mental\" is more difficult, and can only be\\r\\nsatisfactorily given after many difficult controversies have been\\r\\ndiscussed and decided. for present purposes therefore i must content\\r\\nmyself with assuming a dogmatic answer to these controversies. i shall\\r\\ncall a particular \"mental\" when it is aware of something, and i shall\\r\\ncall a fact \"mental\" when it contains a mental particular as a\\r\\nconstituent.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that the mental and the physical are not necessarily\\r\\nmutually exclusive, although i know of no reason to suppose that they\\r\\noverlap.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe doubt as to the correctness of our definition of the \"mental\" is\\r\\nof little importance in our present discussion. for what i am\\r\\nconcerned to maintain is that sense-data are physical, and this being\\r\\ngranted it is a matter of indifference in our present inquiry whether\\r\\nor not they are also mental. although i do not hold, with mach and\\r\\njames and the \"new realists,\" that the difference between the mental\\r\\nand the physical is _merely_ one of arrangement, yet what i have to\\r\\nsay in the present paper is compatible with their doctrine and might\\r\\nhave been reached from their standpoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nin discussions on sense-data, two questions are commonly confused,\\r\\nnamely:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) do sensible objects persist when we are not sensible of them? in\\r\\nother words, do _sensibilia_ which are data at a certain time\\r\\nsometimes continue to exist at times when they are not data? and (2)\\r\\nare sense-data mental or physical?\\r\\n\\r\\ni propose to assert that sense-data are physical, while yet\\r\\nmaintaining that they probably never persist unchanged after ceasing\\r\\nto be data. the view that they do not persist is often thought, quite\\r\\nerroneously in my opinion, to imply that they are mental; and this\\r\\nhas, i believe, been a potent source of confusion in regard to our\\r\\npresent problem. if there were, as some have held, a _logical\\r\\nimpossibility_ in sense-data persisting after ceasing to be data, that\\r\\ncertainly would tend to show that they were mental; but if, as i\\r\\ncontend, their non-persistence is merely a probable inference from\\r\\nempirically ascertained causal laws, then it carries no such\\r\\nimplication with it, and we are quite free to treat them as part of\\r\\nthe subject-matter of physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nlogically a sense-datum is an object, a particular of which the\\r\\nsubject is aware. it does not contain the subject as a part, as for\\r\\nexample beliefs and volitions do. the existence of the sense-datum is\\r\\ntherefore not logically dependent upon that of the subject; for the\\r\\nonly way, so far as i know, in which the existence of _a_ can be\\r\\n_logically_ dependent upon the existence of _b_ is when _b_ is part of\\r\\n_a_. there is therefore no _a priori_ reason why a particular which is\\r\\na sense-datum should not persist after it has ceased to be a datum,\\r\\nnor why other similar particulars should not exist without ever being\\r\\ndata. the view that sense-data are mental is derived, no doubt, in\\r\\npart from their physiological subjectivity, but in part also from a\\r\\nfailure to distinguish between sense-data and \"sensations.\" by a\\r\\nsensation i mean the fact consisting in the subject\\'s awareness of the\\r\\nsense-datum. thus a sensation is a complex of which the subject is a\\r\\nconstituent and which therefore is mental. the sense-datum, on the\\r\\nother hand, stands over against the subject as that external object of\\r\\nwhich in sensation the subject is aware. it is true that the\\r\\nsense-datum is in many cases in the subject\\'s body, but the subject\\'s\\r\\nbody is as distinct from the subject as tables and chairs are, and is\\r\\nin fact merely a part of the material world. so soon, therefore, as\\r\\nsense-data are clearly distinguished from sensations, and as their\\r\\nsubjectivity is recognised to be physiological not psychical, the\\r\\nchief obstacles in the way of regarding them as physical are removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv. \"sensibilia\" and \"things\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut if \"sensibilia\" are to be recognised as the ultimate constituents\\r\\nof the physical world, a long and difficult journey is to be performed\\r\\nbefore we can arrive either at the \"thing\" of common sense or at the\\r\\n\"matter\" of physics. the supposed impossibility of combining the\\r\\ndifferent sense-data which are regarded as appearances of the same\\r\\n\"thing\" to different people has made it seem as though these\\r\\n\"sensibilia\" must be regarded as mere subjective phantasms. a given\\r\\ntable will present to one man a rectangular appearance, while to\\r\\nanother it appears to have two acute angles and two obtuse angles; to\\r\\none man it appears brown, while to another, towards whom it reflects\\r\\nthe light, it appears white and shiny. it is said, not wholly without\\r\\nplausibility, that these different shapes and different colours cannot\\r\\nco-exist simultaneously in the same place, and cannot therefore both\\r\\nbe constituents of the physical world. this argument i must confess\\r\\nappeared to me until recently to be irrefutable. the contrary opinion\\r\\nhas, however, been ably maintained by dr. t.p. nunn in an article\\r\\nentitled: \"are secondary qualities independent of perception?\"[29] the\\r\\nsupposed impossibility derives its apparent force from the phrase:\\r\\n\"_in the same place_,\" and it is precisely in this phrase that its\\r\\nweakness lies. the conception of space is too often treated in\\r\\nphilosophy--even by those who on reflection would not defend such\\r\\ntreatment--as though it were as given, simple, and unambiguous as\\r\\nkant, in his psychological innocence, supposed. it is the unperceived\\r\\nambiguity of the word \"place\" which, as we shall shortly see, has\\r\\ncaused the difficulties to realists and given an undeserved advantage\\r\\nto their opponents. two \"places\" of different kinds are involved in\\r\\nevery sense-datum, namely the place _at_ which it appears and the\\r\\nplace _from_ which it appears. these belong to different spaces,\\r\\nalthough, as we shall see, it is possible, with certain limitations,\\r\\nto establish a correlation between them. what we call the different\\r\\nappearances of the same thing to different observers are each in a\\r\\nspace private to the observer concerned. no place in the private world\\r\\nof one observer is identical with a place in the private world of\\r\\nanother observer. there is therefore no question of combining the\\r\\ndifferent appearances in the one place; and the fact that they cannot\\r\\nall exist in one place affords accordingly no ground whatever for\\r\\nquestioning their physical reality. the \"thing\" of common sense may in\\r\\nfact be identified with the whole class of its appearances--where,\\r\\nhowever, we must include among appearances not only those which are\\r\\nactual sense-data, but also those \"sensibilia,\" if any, which, on\\r\\ngrounds of continuity and resemblance, are to be regarded as belonging\\r\\nto the same system of appearances, although there happen to be no\\r\\nobservers to whom they are data.\\r\\n\\r\\nan example may make this clearer. suppose there are a number of people\\r\\nin a room, all seeing, as they say, the same tables and chairs, walls\\r\\nand pictures. no two of these people have exactly the same sense-data,\\r\\nyet there is sufficient similarity among their data to enable them to\\r\\ngroup together certain of these data as appearances of one \"thing\" to\\r\\nthe several spectators, and others as appearances of another \"thing.\"\\r\\nbesides the appearances which a given thing in the room presents to\\r\\nthe actual spectators, there are, we may suppose, other appearances\\r\\nwhich it would present to other possible spectators. if a man were to\\r\\nsit down between two others, the appearance which the room would\\r\\npresent to him would be intermediate between the appearances which it\\r\\npresents to the two others: and although this appearance would not\\r\\nexist as it is without the sense organs, nerves and brain, of the\\r\\nnewly arrived spectator, still it is not unnatural to suppose that,\\r\\nfrom the position which he now occupies, _some_ appearance of the\\r\\nroom existed before his arrival. this supposition, however, need\\r\\nmerely be noticed and not insisted upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nsince the \"thing\" cannot, without indefensible partiality, be\\r\\nidentified with any single one of its appearances, it came to be\\r\\nthought of as something distinct from all of them and underlying them.\\r\\nbut by the principle of occam\\'s razor, if the class of appearances\\r\\nwill fulfil the purposes for the sake of which the thing was invented\\r\\nby the prehistoric metaphysicians to whom common sense is due, economy\\r\\ndemands that we should identify the thing with the class of its\\r\\nappearances. it is not necessary to _deny_ a substance or substratum\\r\\nunderlying these appearances; it is merely expedient to abstain from\\r\\nasserting this unnecessary entity. our procedure here is precisely\\r\\nanalogous to that which has swept away from the philosophy of\\r\\nmathematics the useless menagerie of metaphysical monsters with which\\r\\nit used to be infested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvi. constructions versus inferences\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore proceeding to analyse and explain the ambiguities of the word\\r\\n\"place,\" a few general remarks on method are desirable. the supreme\\r\\nmaxim in scientific philosophising is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n  _wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted\\r\\n  for inferred entities._\\r\\n\\r\\nsome examples of the substitution of construction for inference in the\\r\\nrealm of mathematical philosophy may serve to elucidate the uses of\\r\\nthis maxim. take first the case of irrationals. in old days,\\r\\nirrationals were inferred as the supposed limits of series of\\r\\nrationals which had no rational limit; but the objection to this\\r\\nprocedure was that it left the existence of irrationals merely\\r\\noptative, and for this reason the stricter methods of the present day\\r\\nno longer tolerate such a definition. we now define an irrational\\r\\nnumber as a certain class of ratios, thus constructing it logically by\\r\\nmeans of ratios, instead of arriving at it by a doubtful inference\\r\\nfrom them. take again the case of cardinal numbers. two equally\\r\\nnumerous collections appear to have something in common: this\\r\\nsomething is supposed to be their cardinal number. but so long as the\\r\\ncardinal number is inferred from the collections, not constructed in\\r\\nterms of them, its existence must remain in doubt, unless in virtue of\\r\\na metaphysical postulate _ad hoc_. by defining the cardinal number of\\r\\na given collection as the class of all equally numerous collections,\\r\\nwe avoid the necessity of this metaphysical postulate, and thereby\\r\\nremove a needless element of doubt from the philosophy of arithmetic.\\r\\na similar method, as i have shown elsewhere, can be applied to classes\\r\\nthemselves, which need not be supposed to have any metaphysical\\r\\nreality, but can be regarded as symbolically constructed fictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe method by which the construction proceeds is closely analogous in\\r\\nthese and all similar cases. given a set of propositions nominally\\r\\ndealing with the supposed inferred entities, we observe the properties\\r\\nwhich are required of the supposed entities in order to make these\\r\\npropositions true. by dint of a little logical ingenuity, we then\\r\\nconstruct some logical function of less hypothetical entities which\\r\\nhas the requisite properties. this constructed function we substitute\\r\\nfor the supposed inferred entities, and thereby obtain a new and less\\r\\ndoubtful interpretation of the body of propositions in question. this\\r\\nmethod, so fruitful in the philosophy of mathematics, will be found\\r\\nequally applicable in the philosophy of physics, where, i do not\\r\\ndoubt, it would have been applied long ago but for the fact that all\\r\\nwho have studied this subject hitherto have been completely ignorant\\r\\nof mathematical logic. i myself cannot claim originality in the\\r\\napplication of this method to physics, since i owe the suggestion and\\r\\nthe stimulus for its application entirely to my friend and\\r\\ncollaborator dr. whitehead, who is engaged in applying it to the more\\r\\nmathematical portions of the region intermediate between sense-data\\r\\nand the points, instants and particles of physics.\\r\\n\\r\\na complete application of the method which substitutes constructions\\r\\nfor inferences would exhibit matter wholly in terms of sense-data, and\\r\\neven, we may add, of the sense-data of a single person, since the\\r\\nsense-data of others cannot be known without some element of\\r\\ninference. this, however, must remain for the present an ideal, to be\\r\\napproached as nearly as possible, but to be reached, if at all, only\\r\\nafter a long preliminary labour of which as yet we can only see the\\r\\nvery beginning. the inferences which are unavoidable can, however, be\\r\\nsubjected to certain guiding principles. in the first place they\\r\\nshould always be made perfectly explicit, and should be formulated in\\r\\nthe most general manner possible. in the second place the inferred\\r\\nentities should, whenever this can be done, be similar to those whose\\r\\nexistence is given, rather than, like the kantian _ding an sich_,\\r\\nsomething wholly remote from the data which nominally support the\\r\\ninference. the inferred entities which i shall allow myself are of two\\r\\nkinds: (_a_) the sense-data of other people, in favour of which there\\r\\nis the evidence of testimony, resting ultimately upon the analogical\\r\\nargument in favour of minds other than my own; (_b_) the \"sensibilia\"\\r\\nwhich would appear from places where there happen to be no minds, and\\r\\nwhich i suppose to be real although they are no one\\'s data. of these\\r\\ntwo classes of inferred entities, the first will probably be allowed\\r\\nto pass unchallenged. it would give me the greatest satisfaction to be\\r\\nable to dispense with it, and thus establish physics upon a\\r\\nsolipsistic basis; but those--and i fear they are the majority--in\\r\\nwhom the human affections are stronger than the desire for logical\\r\\neconomy, will, no doubt, not share my desire to render solipsism\\r\\nscientifically satisfactory. the second class of inferred entities\\r\\nraises much more serious questions. it may be thought monstrous to\\r\\nmaintain that a thing can present any appearance at all in a place\\r\\nwhere no sense organs and nervous structure exist through which it\\r\\ncould appear. i do not myself feel the monstrosity; nevertheless i\\r\\nshould regard these supposed appearances only in the light of a\\r\\nhypothetical scaffolding, to be used while the edifice of physics is\\r\\nbeing raised, though possibly capable of being removed as soon as the\\r\\nedifice is completed. these \"sensibilia\" which are not data to anyone\\r\\nare therefore to be taken rather as an illustrative hypothesis and as\\r\\nan aid in preliminary statement than as a dogmatic part of the\\r\\nphilosophy of physics in its final form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvii. private space and the space of perspectives\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now to explain the ambiguity in the word \"place,\" and how it\\r\\ncomes that two places of different sorts are associated with every\\r\\nsense-datum, namely the place _at_ which it is and the place _from_\\r\\nwhich it is perceived. the theory to be advocated is closely analogous\\r\\nto leibniz\\'s monadology, from which it differs chiefly in being less\\r\\nsmooth and tidy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first fact to notice is that, so far as can be discovered, no\\r\\nsensibile is ever a datum to two people at once. the things seen by\\r\\ntwo different people are often closely similar, so similar that the\\r\\nsame _words_ can be used to denote them, without which communication\\r\\nwith others concerning sensible objects would be impossible. but, in\\r\\nspite of this similarity, it would seem that some difference always\\r\\narises from difference in the point of view. thus each person, so far\\r\\nas his sense-data are concerned, lives in a private world. this\\r\\nprivate world contains its own space, or rather spaces, for it would\\r\\nseem that only experience teaches us to correlate the space of sight\\r\\nwith the space of touch and with the various other spaces of other\\r\\nsenses. this multiplicity of private spaces, however, though\\r\\ninteresting to the psychologist, is of no great importance in regard\\r\\nto our present problem, since a merely solipsistic experience enables\\r\\nus to correlate them into the one private space which embraces all our\\r\\nown sense-data. the place _at_ which a sense-datum is, is a place in\\r\\nprivate space. this place therefore is different from any place in the\\r\\nprivate space of another percipient. for if we assume, as logical\\r\\neconomy demands, that all position is relative, a place is only\\r\\ndefinable by the things in or around it, and therefore the same place\\r\\ncannot occur in two private worlds which have no common constituent.\\r\\nthe question, therefore, of combining what we call different\\r\\nappearances of the same thing in the same place does not arise, and\\r\\nthe fact that a given object appears to different spectators to have\\r\\ndifferent shapes and colours affords no argument against the physical\\r\\nreality of all these shapes and colours.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition to the private spaces belonging to the private worlds of\\r\\ndifferent percipients, there is, however, another space, in which one\\r\\nwhole private world counts as a point, or at least as a spatial unit.\\r\\nthis might be described as the space of points of view, since each\\r\\nprivate world may be regarded as the appearance which the universe\\r\\npresents from a certain point of view. i prefer, however, to speak of\\r\\nit as the space of _perspectives_, in order to obviate the suggestion\\r\\nthat a private world is only real when someone views it. and for the\\r\\nsame reason, when i wish to speak of a private world without assuming\\r\\na percipient, i shall call it a \"perspective.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now to explain how the different perspectives are ordered in\\r\\none space. this is effected by means of the correlated \"sensibilia\"\\r\\nwhich are regarded as the appearances, in different perspectives, of\\r\\none and the same thing. by moving, and by testimony, we discover that\\r\\ntwo different perspectives, though they cannot both contain the same\\r\\n\"sensibilia,\" may nevertheless contain very similar ones; and the\\r\\nspatial order of a certain group of \"sensibilia\" in a private space of\\r\\none perspective is found to be identical with, or very similar to, the\\r\\nspatial order of the correlated \"sensibilia\" in the private space of\\r\\nanother perspective. in this way one \"sensibile\" in one perspective is\\r\\ncorrelated with one \"sensibile\" in another. such correlated\\r\\n\"sensibilia\" will be called \"appearances of one thing.\" in leibniz\\'s\\r\\nmonadology, since each monad mirrored the whole universe, there was in\\r\\neach perspective a \"sensibile\" which was an appearance of each thing.\\r\\nin our system of perspectives, we make no such assumption of\\r\\ncompleteness. a given thing will have appearances in some\\r\\nperspectives, but presumably not in certain others. the \"thing\" being\\r\\ndefined as the class of its appearances, if  is the class of\\r\\nperspectives in which a certain thing  appears, then  is a member of\\r\\nthe multiplicative class of ,  being a class of mutually exclusive\\r\\nclasses of \"sensibilia.\" and similarly a perspective is a member of\\r\\nthe multiplicative class of the things which appear in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe arrangement of perspectives in a space is effected by means of the\\r\\ndifferences between the appearances of a given thing in the various\\r\\nperspectives. suppose, say, that a certain penny appears in a number\\r\\nof different perspectives; in some it looks larger and in some\\r\\nsmaller, in some it looks circular, in others it presents the\\r\\nappearance of an ellipse of varying eccentricity. we may collect\\r\\ntogether all those perspectives in which the appearance of the penny\\r\\nis circular. these we will place on one straight line, ordering them\\r\\nin a series by the variations in the apparent size of the penny. those\\r\\nperspectives in which the penny appears as a straight line of a\\r\\ncertain thickness will similarly be placed upon a plane (though in\\r\\nthis case there will be many different perspectives in which the penny\\r\\nis of the same size; when one arrangement is completed these will form\\r\\na circle concentric with the penny), and ordered as before by the\\r\\napparent size of the penny. by such means, all those perspectives in\\r\\nwhich the penny presents a visual appearance can be arranged in a\\r\\nthree-dimensional spatial order. experience shows that the same\\r\\nspatial order of perspectives would have resulted if, instead of the\\r\\npenny, we had chosen any other thing which appeared in all the\\r\\nperspectives in question, or any other method of utilising the\\r\\ndifferences between the appearances of the same things in different\\r\\nperspectives. it is this empirical fact which has made it possible to\\r\\nconstruct the one all-embracing space of physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space whose construction has just been explained, and whose\\r\\nelements are whole perspectives, will be called \"perspective-space.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nviii. the placing of \"things\" and \"sensibilia\" in perspective space\\r\\n\\r\\nthe world which we have so far constructed is a world of six\\r\\ndimensions, since it is a three-dimensional series of perspectives,\\r\\neach of which is itself three-dimensional. we have now to explain the\\r\\ncorrelation between the perspective space and the various private\\r\\nspaces contained within the various perspectives severally. it is by\\r\\nmeans of this correlation that the one three-dimensional space of\\r\\nphysics is constructed; and it is because of the unconscious\\r\\nperformance of this correlation that the distinction between\\r\\nperspective space and the percipient\\'s private space has been blurred,\\r\\nwith disastrous results for the philosophy of physics. let us revert\\r\\nto our penny: the perspectives in which the penny appears larger are\\r\\nregarded as being nearer to the penny than those in which it appears\\r\\nsmaller, but as far as experience goes the apparent size of the penny\\r\\nwill not grow beyond a certain limit, namely, that where (as we say)\\r\\nthe penny is so near the eye that if it were any nearer it could not\\r\\nbe seen. by touch we may prolong the series until the penny touches\\r\\nthe eye, but no further. if we have been travelling along a line of\\r\\nperspectives in the previously defined sense, we may, however, by\\r\\nimagining the penny removed, prolong the line of perspectives by\\r\\nmeans, say, of another penny; and the same may be done with any other\\r\\nline of perspectives defined by means of the penny. all these lines\\r\\nmeet in a certain place, that is, in a certain perspective. this\\r\\nperspective will be defined as \"the place where the penny is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nit is now evident in what sense two places in constructed physical\\r\\nspace are associated with a given \"sensibile.\" there is first the\\r\\nplace which is the perspective of which the \"sensibile\" is a member.\\r\\nthis is the place _from_ which the \"sensibile\" appears. secondly there\\r\\nis the place where the thing is of which the \"sensibile\" is a member,\\r\\nin other words an appearance; this is the place _at_ which the\\r\\n\"sensibile\" appears. the \"sensibile\" which is a member of one\\r\\nperspective is correlated with another perspective, namely, that which\\r\\nis the place where the thing is of which the \"sensibile\" is an\\r\\nappearance. to the psychologist the \"place from which\" is the more\\r\\ninteresting, and the \"sensibile\" accordingly appears to him subjective\\r\\nand where the percipient is. to the physicist the \"place at which\" is\\r\\nthe more interesting, and the \"sensibile\" accordingly appears to him\\r\\nphysical and external. the causes, limits and partial justification of\\r\\neach of these two apparently incompatible views are evident from the\\r\\nabove duplicity of places associated with a given \"sensibile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have seen that we can assign to a physical thing a place in the\\r\\nperspective space. in this way different parts of our body acquire\\r\\npositions in perspective space, and therefore there is a meaning\\r\\n(whether true or false need not much concern us) in saying that the\\r\\nperspective to which our sense-data belong is inside our head. since\\r\\nour mind is correlated with the perspective to which our sense-data\\r\\nbelong, we may regard this perspective as being the position of our\\r\\nmind in perspective space. if, therefore, this perspective is, in the\\r\\nabove defined sense, inside our head, there is a good meaning for the\\r\\nstatement that the mind is in the head. we can now say of the various\\r\\nappearances of a given thing that some of them are nearer to the thing\\r\\nthan others; those are nearer which belong to perspectives that are\\r\\nnearer to \"the place where the thing is.\" we can thus find a meaning,\\r\\ntrue or false, for the statement that more is to be learnt about a\\r\\nthing by examining it close to than by viewing it from a distance. we\\r\\ncan also find a meaning for the phrase \"the things which intervene\\r\\nbetween the subject and a thing of which an appearance is a datum to\\r\\nhim.\" one reason often alleged for the subjectivity of sense-data is\\r\\nthat the appearance of a thing may change when we find it hard to\\r\\nsuppose that the thing itself has changed--for example, when the\\r\\nchange is due to our shutting our eyes, or to our screwing them up so\\r\\nas to make the thing look double. if the thing is defined as the class\\r\\nof its appearances (which is the definition adopted above), there is\\r\\nof course necessarily _some_ change in the thing whenever any one of\\r\\nits appearances changes. nevertheless there is a very important\\r\\ndistinction between two different ways in which the appearances may\\r\\nchange. if after looking at a thing i shut my eyes, the appearance of\\r\\nmy eyes changes in every perspective in which there is such an\\r\\nappearance, whereas most of the appearances of the thing will remain\\r\\nunchanged. we may say, as a matter of definition, that a thing changes\\r\\nwhen, however near to the thing an appearance of it may be, there are\\r\\nchanges in appearances as near as, or still nearer to, the thing. on\\r\\nthe other hand we shall say that the change is in some other thing if\\r\\nall appearances of the thing which are at not more than a certain\\r\\ndistance from the thing remain unchanged, while only comparatively\\r\\ndistant appearances of the thing are altered. from this consideration\\r\\nwe are naturally led to the consideration of _matter_, which must be\\r\\nour next topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nix. the definition of matter\\r\\n\\r\\nwe defined the \"physical thing\" as the class of its appearances, but\\r\\nthis can hardly be taken as a definition of matter. we want to be able\\r\\nto express the fact that the appearance of a thing in a given\\r\\nperspective is causally affected by the matter between the thing and\\r\\nthe perspective. we have found a meaning for \"between a thing and a\\r\\nperspective.\" but we want matter to be something other than the whole\\r\\nclass of appearances of a thing, in order to state the influence of\\r\\nmatter on appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe commonly assume that the information we get about a thing is more\\r\\naccurate when the thing is nearer. far off, we see it is a man; then\\r\\nwe see it is jones; then we see he is smiling. complete accuracy would\\r\\nonly be attainable as a limit: if the appearances of jones as we\\r\\napproach him tend towards a limit, that limit may be taken to be what\\r\\njones really is. it is obvious that from the point of view of physics\\r\\nthe appearances of a thing close to \"count\" more than the appearances\\r\\nfar off. we may therefore set up the following tentative definition:\\r\\n\\r\\nthe _matter_ of a given thing is the limit of its appearances as their\\r\\ndistance from the thing diminishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nit seems probable that there is something in this definition, but it\\r\\nis not quite satisfactory, because empirically there is no such limit\\r\\nto be obtained from sense-data. the definition will have to be eked\\r\\nout by constructions and definitions. but probably it suggests the\\r\\nright direction in which to look.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are now in a position to understand in outline the reverse journey\\r\\nfrom matter to sense-data which is performed by physics. the\\r\\nappearance of a thing in a given perspective is a function of the\\r\\nmatter composing the thing and of the intervening matter. the\\r\\nappearance of a thing is altered by intervening smoke or mist, by blue\\r\\nspectacles or by alterations in the sense-organs or nerves of the\\r\\npercipient (which also must be reckoned as part of the intervening\\r\\nmedium). the nearer we approach to the thing, the less its appearance\\r\\nis affected by the intervening matter. as we travel further and\\r\\nfurther from the thing, its appearances diverge more and more from\\r\\ntheir initial character; and the causal laws of their divergence are\\r\\nto be stated in terms of the matter which lies between them and the\\r\\nthing. since the appearances at very small distances are less affected\\r\\nby causes other than the thing itself, we come to think that the limit\\r\\ntowards which these appearances tend as the distance diminishes is\\r\\nwhat the thing \"really is,\" as opposed to what it merely seems to be.\\r\\nthis, together with its necessity for the statement of causal laws,\\r\\nseems to be the source of the entirely erroneous feeling that matter\\r\\nis more \"real\" than sense-data.\\r\\n\\r\\nconsider for example the infinite divisibility of matter. in looking\\r\\nat a given thing and approaching it, one sense-datum will become\\r\\nseveral, and each of these will again divide. thus _one_ appearance\\r\\nmay represent _many_ things, and to this process there seems no end.\\r\\nhence in the limit, when we approach indefinitely near to the thing\\r\\nthere will be an indefinite number of units of matter corresponding to\\r\\nwhat, at a finite distance, is only one appearance. this is how\\r\\ninfinite divisibility arises.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole causal efficacy of a thing resides in its matter. this is in\\r\\nsome sense an empirical fact, but it would be hard to state it\\r\\nprecisely, because \"causal efficacy\" is difficult to define.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat can be known empirically about the matter of a thing is only\\r\\napproximate, because we cannot get to know the appearances of the\\r\\nthing from very small distances, and cannot accurately infer the limit\\r\\nof these appearances. but it _is_ inferred _approximately_ by means of\\r\\nthe appearances we can observe. it then turns out that these\\r\\nappearances can be exhibited by physics as a function of the matter\\r\\nin our immediate neighbourhood; e.g. the visual appearance of a\\r\\ndistant object is a function of the light-waves that reach the eyes.\\r\\nthis leads to confusions of thought, but offers no real difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\none appearance, of a visible object for example, is not sufficient to\\r\\ndetermine its other simultaneous appearances, although it goes a\\r\\ncertain distance towards determining them. the determination of the\\r\\nhidden structure of a thing, so far as it is possible at all, can only\\r\\nbe effected by means of elaborate dynamical inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx. time[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nit seems that the one all-embracing time is a construction, like the\\r\\none all-embracing space. physics itself has become conscious of this\\r\\nfact through the discussions connected with relativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nbetween two perspectives which both belong to one person\\'s experience,\\r\\nthere will be a direct time-relation of before and after. this\\r\\nsuggests a way of dividing history in the same sort of way as it is\\r\\ndivided by different experiences, but without introducing experience\\r\\nor anything mental: we may define a \"biography\" as everything that is\\r\\n(directly) earlier or later than, or simultaneous with, a given\\r\\n\"sensibile.\" this will give a series of perspectives, which _might_\\r\\nall form parts of one person\\'s experience, though it is not necessary\\r\\nthat all or any of them should actually do so. by this means, the\\r\\nhistory of the world is divided into a number of mutually exclusive\\r\\nbiographies.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now to correlate the times in the different biographies. the\\r\\nnatural thing would be to say that the appearances of a given\\r\\n(momentary) thing in two different perspectives belonging to different\\r\\nbiographies are to be taken as simultaneous; but this is not\\r\\nconvenient. suppose _a_ shouts to _b_, and _b_ replies as soon as he\\r\\nhears _a\\'s_ shout. then between _a\\'s_ hearing of his own shout and his\\r\\nhearing of _b\\'s_ there is an interval; thus if we made _a\\'s_ and _b\\'s_\\r\\nhearing of the same shout exactly simultaneous with each other, we\\r\\nshould have events exactly simultaneous with a given event but not\\r\\nwith each other. to obviate this, we assume a \"velocity of sound.\"\\r\\nthat is, we assume that the time when _b_ hears _a\\'s_ shout is\\r\\nhalf-way between the time when _a_ hears his own shout and the time\\r\\nwhen he hears _b\\'s_. in this way the correlation is effected.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat has been said about sound applies of course equally to light. the\\r\\ngeneral principle is that the appearances, in different perspectives,\\r\\nwhich are to be grouped together as constituting what a certain thing\\r\\nis at a certain moment, are not to be all regarded as being at that\\r\\nmoment. on the contrary they spread outward from the thing with\\r\\nvarious velocities according to the nature of the appearances. since\\r\\nno _direct_ means exist of correlating the time in one biography with\\r\\nthe time in another, this temporal grouping of the appearances\\r\\nbelonging to a given thing at a given moment is in part conventional.\\r\\nits motive is partly to secure the verification of such maxims as that\\r\\nevents which are exactly simultaneous with the same event are exactly\\r\\nsimultaneous with one another, partly to secure convenience in the\\r\\nformulation of causal laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nxi. the persistence of things and matter\\r\\n\\r\\napart from any of the fluctuating hypotheses of physics, three main\\r\\nproblems arise in connecting the world of physics with the world of\\r\\nsense, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n    1. the construction of a single space;\\r\\n    2. the construction of a single time;\\r\\n    3. the construction of permanent things or matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have already considered the first and second of these problems; it\\r\\nremains to consider the third.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have seen how correlated appearances in different perspectives are\\r\\ncombined to form one \"thing\" at one moment in the all-embracing time\\r\\nof physics. we have now to consider how appearances at different times\\r\\nare combined as belonging to one \"thing,\" and how we arrive at the\\r\\npersistent \"matter\" of physics. the assumption of permanent substance,\\r\\nwhich technically underlies the procedure of physics, cannot of course\\r\\nbe regarded as metaphysically legitimate: just as the one thing\\r\\nsimultaneously seen by many people is a construction, so the one thing\\r\\nseen at different times by the same or different people must be a\\r\\nconstruction, being in fact nothing but a certain grouping of certain\\r\\n\"sensibilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have seen that the momentary state of a \"thing\" is an assemblage of\\r\\n\"sensibilia,\" in different perspectives, not all simultaneous in the\\r\\none constructed time, but spreading out from \"the place where the\\r\\nthing is\" with velocities depending upon the nature of the\\r\\n\"sensibilia.\" the time _at_ which the \"thing\" is in this state is the\\r\\nlower limit of the times at which these appearances occur. we have now\\r\\nto consider what leads us to speak of another set of appearances as\\r\\nbelonging to the same \"thing\" at a different time.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor this purpose, we may, at least to begin with, confine ourselves\\r\\nwithin a single biography. if we can always say when two \"sensibilia\"\\r\\nin a given biography are appearances of one thing, then, since we have\\r\\nseen how to connect \"sensibilia\" in different biographies as\\r\\nappearances of the same momentary state of a thing, we shall have all\\r\\nthat is necessary for the complete construction of the history of a\\r\\nthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is to be observed, to begin with, that the identity of a thing for\\r\\ncommon sense is not always correlated with the identity of matter for\\r\\nphysics. a human body is one persisting thing for common sense, but\\r\\nfor physics its matter is constantly changing. we may say, broadly,\\r\\nthat the common-sense conception is based upon continuity in\\r\\nappearances at the ordinary distances of sense-data, while the\\r\\nphysical conception is based upon the continuity of appearances at\\r\\nvery small distances from the thing. it is probable that the\\r\\ncommon-sense conception is not capable of complete precision. let us\\r\\ntherefore concentrate our attention upon the conception of the\\r\\npersistence of matter in physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first characteristic of two appearances of the same piece of\\r\\nmatter at different times is _continuity_. the two appearances must be\\r\\nconnected by a series of intermediaries, which, if time and space form\\r\\ncompact series, must themselves form a compact series. the colour of\\r\\nthe leaves is different in autumn from what it is in summer; but we\\r\\nbelieve that the change occurs gradually, and that, if the colours are\\r\\ndifferent at two given times, there are intermediate times at which\\r\\nthe colours are intermediate between those at the given times.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there are two considerations that are important as regards\\r\\ncontinuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, it is largely hypothetical. we do not observe any one thing\\r\\ncontinuously, and it is merely a hypothesis to assume that, while we\\r\\nare not observing it, it passes through conditions intermediate\\r\\nbetween those in which it is perceived. during uninterrupted\\r\\nobservation, it is true, continuity is nearly verified; but even here,\\r\\nwhen motions are very rapid, as in the case of explosions, the\\r\\ncontinuity is not actually capable of direct verification. thus we can\\r\\nonly say that the sense-data are found to _permit_ a hypothetical\\r\\ncomplement of \"sensibilia\" such as will preserve continuity, and that\\r\\ntherefore there _may_ be such a complement. since, however, we have\\r\\nalready made such use of hypothetical \"sensibilia,\" we will let this\\r\\npoint pass, and admit such \"sensibilia\" as are required to preserve\\r\\ncontinuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecondly, continuity is not a sufficient criterion of material\\r\\nidentity. it is true that in many cases, such as rocks, mountains,\\r\\ntables, chairs, etc., where the appearances change slowly, continuity\\r\\nis sufficient, but in other cases, such as the parts of an\\r\\napproximately homogeneous fluid, it fails us utterly. we can travel by\\r\\nsensibly continuous gradations from any one drop of the sea at any one\\r\\ntime to any other drop at any other time. we infer the motions of\\r\\nsea-water from the effects of the current, but they cannot be inferred\\r\\nfrom direct sensible observation together with the assumption of\\r\\ncontinuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe characteristic required in addition to continuity is conformity\\r\\nwith the laws of dynamics. starting from what common sense regards as\\r\\npersistent things, and making only such modifications as from time to\\r\\ntime seem reasonable, we arrive at assemblages of \"sensibilia\" which\\r\\nare found to obey certain simple laws, namely those of dynamics. by\\r\\nregarding \"sensibilia\" at different times as belonging to the same\\r\\npiece of matter, we are able to define _motion_, which presupposes the\\r\\nassumption or construction of something persisting throughout the\\r\\ntime of the motion. the motions which are regarded as occurring,\\r\\nduring a period in which all the \"sensibilia\" and the times of their\\r\\nappearance are given, will be different according to the manner in\\r\\nwhich we combine \"sensibilia\" at different times as belonging to the\\r\\nsame piece of matter. thus even when the whole history of the world is\\r\\ngiven in every particular, the question what motions take place is\\r\\nstill to a certain extent arbitrary even after the assumption of\\r\\ncontinuity. experience shows that it is possible to determine motions\\r\\nin such a way as to satisfy the laws of dynamics, and that this\\r\\ndetermination, roughly and on the whole, is fairly in agreement with\\r\\nthe common-sense opinions about persistent things. this determination,\\r\\ntherefore, is adopted, and leads to a criterion by which we can\\r\\ndetermine, sometimes practically, sometimes only theoretically,\\r\\nwhether two appearances at different times are to be regarded as\\r\\nbelonging to the same piece of matter. the persistence of all matter\\r\\nthroughout all time can, i imagine, be secured by definition.\\r\\n\\r\\nto recommend this conclusion, we must consider what it is that is\\r\\nproved by the empirical success of physics. what is proved is that its\\r\\nhypotheses, though unverifiable where they go beyond sense-data, are\\r\\nat no point in contradiction with sense-data, but, on the contrary,\\r\\nare ideally such as to render all sense-data calculable when a\\r\\nsufficient collection of \"sensibilia\" is given. now physics has found\\r\\nit empirically possible to collect sense-data into series, each series\\r\\nbeing regarded as belonging to one \"thing,\" and behaving, with regard\\r\\nto the laws of physics, in a way in which series not belonging to one\\r\\nthing would in general not behave. if it is to be unambiguous whether\\r\\ntwo appearances belong to the same thing or not, there must be only\\r\\none way of grouping appearances so that the resulting things obey the\\r\\nlaws of physics. it would be very difficult to prove that this is the\\r\\ncase, but for our present purposes we may let this point pass, and\\r\\nassume that there is only one way. thus we may lay down the following\\r\\ndefinition: _physical things are those series of appearances whose\\r\\nmatter obeys the laws of physics_. that such series exist is an\\r\\nempirical fact, which constitutes the verifiability of physics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nxii. illusions, hallucinations, and dreams\\r\\n\\r\\nit remains to ask how, in our system, we are to find a place for\\r\\nsense-data which apparently fail to have the usual connection with the\\r\\nworld of physics. such sense-data are of various kinds, requiring\\r\\nsomewhat different treatment. but all are of the sort that would be\\r\\ncalled \"unreal,\" and therefore, before embarking upon the discussion,\\r\\ncertain logical remarks must be made upon the conceptions of reality\\r\\nand unreality.\\r\\n\\r\\nmr. a. wolf[31] says:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"the conception of mind as a system of transparent activities is,\\r\\n  i think, also untenable because of its failure to account for the\\r\\n  very possibility of dreams and hallucinations. it seems impossible\\r\\n  to realise how a bare, transparent activity can be directed to\\r\\n  what is not there, to apprehend what is not given.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis statement is one which, probably, most people would endorse. but\\r\\nit is open to two objections. first it is difficult to see how an\\r\\nactivity, however un-\"transparent,\" can be directed towards a nothing:\\r\\na term of a relation cannot be a mere nonentity. secondly, no reason\\r\\nis given, and i am convinced that none can be given, for the assertion\\r\\nthat dream-objects are not \"there\" and not \"given.\" let us take the\\r\\nsecond point first.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the belief that dream-objects are not given comes, i think, from\\r\\nfailure to distinguish, as regards waking life, between the\\r\\nsense-datum and the corresponding \"thing.\" in dreams, there is no such\\r\\ncorresponding \"thing\" as the dreamer supposes; if, therefore, the\\r\\n\"thing\" were given in waking life, as e.g. meinong maintains,[32] then\\r\\nthere would be a difference in respect of givenness between dreams and\\r\\nwaking life. but if, as we have maintained, what is given is never the\\r\\nthing, but merely one of the \"sensibilia\" which compose the thing,\\r\\nthen what we apprehend in a dream is just as much given as what we\\r\\napprehend in waking life.\\r\\n\\r\\nexactly the same argument applies as to the dream-objects being\\r\\n\"there.\" they have their position in the private space of the\\r\\nperspective of the dreamer; where they fail is in their correlation\\r\\nwith other private spaces and therefore with perspective space. but in\\r\\nthe only sense in which \"there\" can be a datum, they are \"there\" just\\r\\nas truly as any of the sense-data of waking life.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the conception of \"illusion\" or \"unreality,\" and the correlative\\r\\nconception of \"reality,\" are generally used in a way which embodies\\r\\nprofound logical confusions. words that go in pairs, such as \"real\"\\r\\nand \"unreal,\" \"existent\" and \"non-existent,\" \"valid\" and \"invalid,\"\\r\\netc., are all derived from the one fundamental pair, \"true\" and\\r\\n\"false.\" now \"true\" and \"false\" are applicable only--except in\\r\\nderivative significations--to _propositions_. thus wherever the above\\r\\npairs can be significantly applied, we must be dealing either with\\r\\npropositions or with such incomplete phrases as only acquire meaning\\r\\nwhen put into a context which, with them, forms a proposition. thus\\r\\nsuch pairs of words can be applied to _descriptions_,[33] but not to\\r\\nproper names: in other words, they have no application whatever to\\r\\ndata, but only to entities or non-entities described in terms of data.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us illustrate by the terms \"existence\" and \"non-existence.\" given\\r\\nany datum _x_, it is meaningless either to assert or to deny that _x_\\r\\n\"exists.\" we might be tempted to say: \"of course _x_ exists, for\\r\\notherwise it could not be a datum.\" but such a statement is really\\r\\nmeaningless, although it is significant and true to say \"my present\\r\\nsense-datum exists,\" and it may also be true that \"_x_ is my present\\r\\nsense-datum.\" the inference from these two propositions to \"_x_\\r\\nexists\" is one which seems irresistible to people unaccustomed to\\r\\nlogic; yet the apparent proposition inferred is not merely false, but\\r\\nstrictly meaningless. to say \"my present sense-datum exists\" is to say\\r\\n(roughly): \"there is an object of which \\'my present sense-datum\\' is a\\r\\ndescription.\" but we cannot say: \"there is an object of which \\'_x_\\' is\\r\\na description,\" because \\'_x_\\' is (in the case we are supposing) a\\r\\nname, not a description. dr. whitehead and i have explained this point\\r\\nfully elsewhere (_loc. cit._) with the help of symbols, without which\\r\\nit is hard to understand; i shall not therefore here repeat the\\r\\ndemonstration of the above propositions, but shall proceed with their\\r\\napplication to our present problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fact that \"existence\" is only applicable to descriptions is\\r\\nconcealed by the use of what are grammatically proper names in a way\\r\\nwhich really transforms them into descriptions. it is, for example, a\\r\\nlegitimate question whether homer existed; but here \"homer\" means\\r\\n\"the author of the homeric poems,\" and is a description. similarly we\\r\\nmay ask whether god exists; but then \"god\" means \"the supreme being\"\\r\\nor \"the _ens realissimum_\" or whatever other description we may\\r\\nprefer. if \"god\" were a proper name, god would have to be a datum; and\\r\\nthen no question could arise as to his existence. the distinction\\r\\nbetween existence and other predicates, which kant obscurely felt, is\\r\\nbrought to light by the theory of descriptions, and is seen to remove\\r\\n\"existence\" altogether from the fundamental notions of metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat has been said about \"existence\" applies equally to \"reality,\"\\r\\nwhich may, in fact, be taken as synonymous with \"existence.\"\\r\\nconcerning the immediate objects in illusions, hallucinations, and\\r\\ndreams, it is meaningless to ask whether they \"exist\" or are \"real.\"\\r\\nthere they are, and that ends the matter. but we may legitimately\\r\\ninquire as to the existence or reality of \"things\" or other\\r\\n\"sensibilia\" inferred from such objects. it is the unreality of these\\r\\n\"things\" and other \"sensibilia,\" together with a failure to notice\\r\\nthat they are not data, which has led to the view that the objects of\\r\\ndreams are unreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now apply these considerations in detail to the stock arguments\\r\\nagainst realism, though what is to be said will be mainly a repetition\\r\\nof what others have said before.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) we have first the variety of normal appearances, supposed to be\\r\\nincompatible. this is the case of the different shapes and colours\\r\\nwhich a given thing presents to different spectators. locke\\'s water\\r\\nwhich seems both hot and cold belongs to this class of cases. our\\r\\nsystem of different perspectives fully accounts for these cases, and\\r\\nshows that they afford no argument against realism.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) we have cases where the correlation between different senses is\\r\\nunusual. the bent stick in water belongs here. people say it looks\\r\\nbent but is straight: this only means that it is straight to the\\r\\ntouch, though bent to sight. there is no \"illusion,\" but only a false\\r\\ninference, if we think that the stick would feel bent to the touch.\\r\\nthe stick would look just as bent in a photograph, and, as mr.\\r\\ngladstone used to say, \"the photograph cannot lie.\"[34] the case of\\r\\nseeing double also belongs here, though in this case the cause of the\\r\\nunusual correlation is physiological, and would therefore not operate\\r\\nin a photograph. it is a mistake to ask whether the \"thing\" is\\r\\nduplicated when we see it double. the \"thing\" is a whole system of\\r\\n\"sensibilia,\" and it is only those visual \"sensibilia\" which are data\\r\\nto the percipient that are duplicated. the phenomenon has a purely\\r\\nphysiological explanation; indeed, in view of our having two eyes, it\\r\\nis in less need of explanation than the single visual sense-datum\\r\\nwhich we normally obtain from the things on which we focus.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) we come now to cases like dreams, which may, at the moment of\\r\\ndreaming, contain nothing to arouse suspicion, but are condemned on the\\r\\nground of their supposed incompatibility with earlier and later data. of\\r\\ncourse it often happens that dream-objects fail to behave in the\\r\\naccustomed manner: heavy objects fly, solid objects melt, babies turn\\r\\ninto pigs or undergo even greater changes. but none of these unusual\\r\\noccurrences _need_ happen in a dream, and it is not on account of such\\r\\noccurrences that dream-objects are called \"unreal.\" it is their lack of\\r\\ncontinuity with the dreamer\\'s past and future that makes him, when he\\r\\nwakes, condemn them; and it is their lack of correlation with other\\r\\nprivate worlds that makes others condemn them. omitting the latter\\r\\nground, our reason for condemning them is that the \"things\" which we\\r\\ninfer from them cannot be combined according to the laws of physics with\\r\\nthe \"things\" inferred from waking sense-data. this might be used to\\r\\ncondemn the \"things\" inferred from the data of dreams. dream-data are no\\r\\ndoubt appearances of \"things,\" but not of such \"things\" as the dreamer\\r\\nsupposes. i have no wish to combat psychological theories of dreams,\\r\\nsuch as those of the psycho-analysts. but there certainly are cases\\r\\nwhere (whatever psychological causes may contribute) the presence of\\r\\nphysical causes also is very evident. for instance, a door banging may\\r\\nproduce a dream of a naval engagement, with images of battleships and\\r\\nsea and smoke. the whole dream will be an appearance of the door\\r\\nbanging, but owing to the peculiar condition of the body (especially the\\r\\nbrain) during sleep, this appearance is not that expected to be produced\\r\\nby a door banging, and thus the dreamer is led to entertain false\\r\\nbeliefs. but his sense-data are still physical, and are such as a\\r\\ncompleted physics would include and calculate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) the last class of illusions are those which cannot be discovered\\r\\nwithin one person\\'s experience, except through the discovery of\\r\\ndiscrepancies with the experiences of others. dreams might conceivably\\r\\nbelong to this class, if they were jointed sufficiently neatly into\\r\\nwaking life; but the chief instances are recurrent sensory\\r\\nhallucinations of the kind that lead to insanity. what makes the\\r\\npatient, in such cases, become what others call insane is the fact\\r\\nthat, within his own experience, there is nothing to show that the\\r\\nhallucinatory sense-data do not have the usual kind of connection with\\r\\n\"sensibilia\" in other perspectives. of course he may learn this\\r\\nthrough testimony, but he probably finds it simpler to suppose that\\r\\nthe testimony is untrue and that he is being wilfully deceived. there\\r\\nis, so far as i can see, no theoretical criterion by which the patient\\r\\ncan decide, in such a case, between the two equally satisfactory\\r\\nhypotheses of his madness and of his friends\\' mendacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the above instances it would appear that abnormal sense-data, of\\r\\nthe kind which we regard as deceptive, have intrinsically just the\\r\\nsame status as any others, but differ as regards their correlations or\\r\\ncausal connections with other \"sensibilia\" and with \"things.\" since\\r\\nthe usual correlations and connections become part of our unreflective\\r\\nexpectations, and even seem, except to the psychologist, to form part\\r\\nof our data, it comes to be thought, mistakenly, that in such cases\\r\\nthe data are unreal, whereas they are merely the causes of false\\r\\ninferences. the fact that correlations and connections of unusual\\r\\nkinds occur adds to the difficulty of inferring things from sense and\\r\\nof expressing physics in terms of sense-data. but the unusualness\\r\\nwould seem to be always physically or physiologically explicable, and\\r\\ntherefore raises only a complication, not a philosophical objection.\\r\\n\\r\\ni conclude, therefore, that no valid objection exists to the view\\r\\nwhich regards sense-data as part of the actual substance of the\\r\\nphysical world, and that, on the other hand, this view is the only one\\r\\nwhich accounts for the empirical verifiability of physics. in the\\r\\npresent paper, i have given only a rough preliminary sketch. in\\r\\nparticular, the part played by _time_ in the construction of the\\r\\nphysical world is, i think, more fundamental than would appear from\\r\\nthe above account. i should hope that, with further elaboration, the\\r\\npart played by unperceived \"sensibilia\" could be indefinitely\\r\\ndiminished, probably by invoking the history of a \"thing\" to eke out\\r\\nthe inferences derivable from its momentary appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[29] _proc. arist. soc._, 1909-1910, pp. 191-218.\\r\\n\\r\\n[30] on this subject, compare _a theory of time and space_, by mr.\\r\\na.a. robb (camb. univ.

with misleading associations as to\\r\\nmake its complete extrusion from the philosophical vocabulary\\r\\ndesirable; secondly, to inquire what principle, if any, is employed in\\r\\nscience in place of the supposed \"law of causality\" which philosophers\\r\\nimagine to be employed; thirdly, to exhibit certain confusions,\\r\\nespecially in regard to teleology and determinism, which appear to me\\r\\nto be connected with erroneous notions as to causality.\\r\\n\\r\\nall philosophers, of every school, imagine that causation is one of\\r\\nthe fundamental axioms or postulates of science, yet, oddly enough, in\\r\\nadvanced sciences such as gravitational astronomy, the word \"cause\"\\r\\nnever occurs. dr. james ward, in his _naturalism and agnosticism_,\\r\\nmakes this a ground of complaint against physics: the business of\\r\\nthose who wish to ascertain the ultimate truth about the world, he\\r\\napparently thinks, should be the discovery of causes, yet physics\\r\\nnever even seeks them. to me it seems that philosophy ought not to\\r\\nassume such legislative functions, and that the reason why physics has\\r\\nceased to look for causes is that, in fact, there are no such things.\\r\\nthe law of causality, i believe, like much that passes muster among\\r\\nphilosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the\\r\\nmonarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm. in\\r\\norder to find out what philosophers commonly understand by \"cause,\" i\\r\\nconsulted baldwin\\'s _dictionary_, and was rewarded beyond my\\r\\nexpectations, for i found the following three mutually incompatible\\r\\ndefinitions:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"causality. (1) the necessary connection of events in the\\r\\n     time-series....\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"cause (notion of). whatever may be included in the thought or\\r\\n     perception of a process as taking place in consequence of\\r\\n     another process....\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"cause and effect. (1) cause and effect ... are correlative terms\\r\\n     denoting any two distinguishable things, phases, or aspects of\\r\\n     reality, which are so related to each other that whenever the\\r\\n     first ceases to exist the second comes into existence\\r\\n     immediately after, and whenever the second comes into existence\\r\\n     the first has ceased to exist immediately before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us consider these three definitions in turn. the first, obviously,\\r\\nis unintelligible without a definition of \"necessary.\" under this\\r\\nhead, baldwin\\'s _dictionary_ gives the following:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"necessary. that is necessary which not only is true, but would\\r\\n     be true under all circumstances. something more than brute\\r\\n     compulsion is, therefore, involved in the conception; there is\\r\\n     a general law under which the thing takes place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe notion of cause is so intimately connected with that of necessity\\r\\nthat it will be no digression to linger over the above definition,\\r\\nwith a view to discovering, if possible, _some_ meaning of which it is\\r\\ncapable; for, as it stands, it is very far from having any definite\\r\\nsignification.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first point to notice is that, if any meaning is to be given to\\r\\nthe phrase \"would be true under all circumstances,\" the subject of it\\r\\nmust be a propositional function, not a proposition.[35] a\\r\\nproposition is simply true or false, and that ends the matter: there\\r\\ncan be no question of \"circumstances.\" \"charles i\\'s head was cut off\"\\r\\nis just as true in summer as in winter, on sundays as on mondays. thus\\r\\nwhen it is worth saying that something \"would be true under all\\r\\ncircumstances,\" the something in question must be a propositional\\r\\nfunction, i.e. an expression containing a variable, and becoming a\\r\\nproposition when a value is assigned to the variable; the varying\\r\\n\"circumstances\" alluded to are then the different values of which the\\r\\nvariable is capable. thus if \"necessary\" means \"what is true under all\\r\\ncircumstances,\" then \"if _x_ is a man, _x_ is mortal\" is necessary,\\r\\nbecause it is true for any possible value of _x_. thus we should be\\r\\nled to the following definition:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"necessary is a predicate of a propositional function, meaning\\r\\n     that it is true for all possible values of its argument or\\r\\n     arguments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately, however, the definition in baldwin\\'s _dictionary_ says\\r\\nthat what is necessary is not only \"true under all circumstances\" but\\r\\nis also \"true.\" now these two are incompatible. only propositions can\\r\\nbe \"true,\" and only propositional functions can be \"true under all\\r\\ncircumstances.\" hence the definition as it stands is nonsense. what is\\r\\nmeant seems to be this: \"a proposition is necessary when it is a value\\r\\nof a propositional function which is true under all circumstances,\\r\\ni.e. for all values of its argument or arguments.\" but if we adopt\\r\\nthis definition, the same proposition will be necessary or contingent\\r\\naccording as we choose one or other of its terms as the argument to\\r\\nour propositional function. for example, \"if socrates is a man,\\r\\nsocrates is mortal,\" is necessary if socrates is chosen as argument,\\r\\nbut not if _man_ or _mortal_ is chosen. again, \"if socrates is a man,\\r\\nplato is mortal,\" will be necessary if either socrates or _man_ is\\r\\nchosen as argument, but not if plato or _mortal_ is chosen. however,\\r\\nthis difficulty can be overcome by specifying the constituent which is\\r\\nto be regarded as argument, and we thus arrive at the following\\r\\ndefinition:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"a proposition is _necessary_ with respect to a given constituent if\\r\\nit remains true when that constituent is altered in any way compatible\\r\\nwith the proposition remaining significant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now apply this definition to the definition of causality quoted\\r\\nabove. it is obvious that the argument must be the time at which the\\r\\nearlier event occurs. thus an instance of causality will be such as:\\r\\n\"if the event [math: e_{1}] occurs at the time [math: t_{1}], it will\\r\\nbe followed by the event [math: e_{2}].\" this proposition is intended\\r\\nto be necessary with respect to [math: t_{1}], i.e. to remain true\\r\\nhowever [math: t_{1}] may be varied. causality, as a universal law,\\r\\nwill then be the following: \"given any event [math: t_{1}], there is\\r\\nan event [math: e_{2}] such that, whenever [math: t_{1}] occurs,\\r\\n[math: e_{2}] occurs later.\" but before this can be considered\\r\\nprecise, we must specify how much later [math: e_{2}] is to occur.\\r\\nthus the principle becomes:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"given any event [math: e_{1}], there is an event [math: e_{2}] and a\\r\\ntime-interval  such that, whenever [math: e_{1}] occurs, [math:\\r\\ne_{2}] follows after an interval .\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni am not concerned as yet to consider whether this law is true or\\r\\nfalse. for the present, i am merely concerned to discover what the law\\r\\nof causality is supposed to be. i pass, therefore, to the other\\r\\ndefinitions quoted above.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second definition need not detain us long, for two reasons. first,\\r\\nbecause it is psychological: not the \"thought or perception\" of a\\r\\nprocess, but the process itself, must be what concerns us in\\r\\nconsidering causality. secondly, because it is circular: in speaking\\r\\nof a process as \"taking place in consequence of\" another process, it\\r\\nintroduces the very notion of cause which was to be defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe third definition is by far the most precise; indeed as regards\\r\\nclearness it leaves nothing to be desired. but a great difficulty is\\r\\ncaused by the temporal contiguity of cause and effect which the\\r\\ndefinition asserts. no two instants are contiguous, since the\\r\\ntime-series is compact; hence either the cause or the effect or both\\r\\nmust, if the definition is correct, endure for a finite time; indeed,\\r\\nby the wording of the definition it is plain that both are assumed to\\r\\nendure for a finite time. but then we are faced with a dilemma: if the\\r\\ncause is a process involving change within itself, we shall require\\r\\n(if causality is universal) causal relations between its earlier and\\r\\nlater parts; moreover, it would seem that only the later parts can be\\r\\nrelevant to the effect, since the earlier parts are not contiguous to\\r\\nthe effect, and therefore (by the definition) cannot influence the\\r\\neffect. thus we shall be led to diminish the duration of the cause\\r\\nwithout limit, and however much we may diminish it, there will still\\r\\nremain an earlier part which might be altered without altering the\\r\\neffect, so that the true cause, as defined, will not have been\\r\\nreached, for it will be observed that the definition excludes\\r\\nplurality of causes. if, on the other hand, the cause is purely\\r\\nstatic, involving no change within itself, then, in the first place,\\r\\nno such cause is to be found in nature, and in the second place, it\\r\\nseems strange--too strange to be accepted, in spite of bare logical\\r\\npossibility--that the cause, after existing placidly for some time,\\r\\nshould suddenly explode into the effect, when it might just as well\\r\\nhave done so at any earlier time, or have gone on unchanged without\\r\\nproducing its effect. this dilemma, therefore, is fatal to the view\\r\\nthat cause and effect can be contiguous in time; if there are causes\\r\\nand effects, they must be separated by a finite time-interval , as\\r\\nwas assumed in the above interpretation of the first definition.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat is essentially the same statement of the law of causality as the\\r\\none elicited above from the first of baldwin\\'s definitions is given by\\r\\nother philosophers. thus john stuart mill says:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the law of causation, the recognition of which is the main pillar of\\r\\ninductive science, is but the familiar truth, that invariability of\\r\\nsuccession is found by observation to obtain between every fact in\\r\\nnature and some other fact which has preceded it.\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nand bergson, who has rightly perceived that the law as stated by\\r\\nphilosophers is worthless, nevertheless continues to suppose that it\\r\\nis used in science. thus he says:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"now, it is argued, this law [the law of causality] means that every\\r\\nphenomenon is determined by its conditions, or, in other words, that\\r\\nthe same causes produce the same effects.\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nand again:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"we perceive physical phenomena, and these phenomena obey laws. this\\r\\nmeans: (1) that phenomena _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, previously perceived,\\r\\ncan occur again in the same shape; (2) that a certain phenomenon p,\\r\\nwhich appeared after the conditions _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and after\\r\\nthese conditions only, will not fail to recur as soon as the same\\r\\nconditions are again present.\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\na great part of bergson\\'s attack on science rests on the assumption\\r\\nthat it employs this principle. in fact, it employs no such principle,\\r\\nbut philosophers--even bergson--are too apt to take their views on\\r\\nscience from each other, not from science. as to what the principle\\r\\nis, there is a fair consensus among philosophers of different schools.\\r\\nthere are, however, a number of difficulties which at once arise. i\\r\\nomit the question of plurality of causes for the present, since other\\r\\ngraver questions have to be considered. two of these, which are forced\\r\\non our attention by the above statement of the law, are the\\r\\nfollowing:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  (1) what is meant by an \"event\"?\\r\\n\\r\\n  (2) how long may the time-interval be between cause and effect?\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) an \"event,\" in the statement of the law, is obviously intended to\\r\\nbe something that is likely to recur since otherwise the law becomes\\r\\ntrivial. it follows that an \"event\" is not a particular, but some\\r\\nuniversal of which there may be many instances. it follows also that\\r\\nan \"event\" must be something short of the whole state of the universe,\\r\\nsince it is highly improbable that this will recur. what is meant by\\r\\nan \"event\" is something like striking a match, or dropping a penny\\r\\ninto the slot of an automatic machine. if such an event is to recur,\\r\\nit must not be defined too narrowly: we must not state with what\\r\\ndegree of force the match is to be struck, nor what is to be the\\r\\ntemperature of the penny. for if such considerations were relevant,\\r\\nour \"event\" would occur at most once, and the law would cease to give\\r\\ninformation. an \"event,\" then, is a universal defined sufficiently\\r\\nwidely to admit of many particular occurrences in time being instances\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the next question concerns the time-interval. philosophers, no\\r\\ndoubt, think of cause and effect as contiguous in time, but this, for\\r\\nreasons already given, is impossible. hence, since there are no\\r\\ninfinitesimal time-intervals, there must be some finite lapse of time\\r\\n between cause and effect. this, however, at once raises insuperable\\r\\ndifficulties. however short we make the interval , something may\\r\\nhappen during this interval which prevents the expected result. i put\\r\\nmy penny in the slot, but before i can draw out my ticket there is an\\r\\nearthquake which upsets the machine and my calculations. in order to\\r\\nbe sure of the expected effect, we must know that there is nothing in\\r\\nthe environment to interfere with it. but this means that the supposed\\r\\ncause is not, by itself, adequate to insure the effect. and as soon as\\r\\nwe include the environment, the probability of repetition is\\r\\ndiminished, until at last, when the whole environment is included, the\\r\\nprobability of repetition becomes almost _nil_.\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite of these difficulties, it must, of course, be admitted that\\r\\nmany fairly dependable regularities of sequence occur in daily life.\\r\\nit is these regularities that have suggested the supposed law of\\r\\ncausality; where they are found to fail, it is thought that a better\\r\\nformulation could have been found which would have never failed. i am\\r\\nfar from denying that there may be such sequences which in fact never\\r\\ndo fail. it may be that there will never be an exception to the rule\\r\\nthat when a stone of more than a certain mass, moving with more than a\\r\\ncertain velocity, comes in contact with a pane of glass of less than\\r\\na certain thickness, the glass breaks. i also do not deny that the\\r\\nobservation of such regularities, even when they are not without\\r\\nexceptions, is useful in the infancy of a science: the observation\\r\\nthat unsupported bodies in air usually fall was a stage on the way to\\r\\nthe law of gravitation. what i deny is that science assumes the\\r\\nexistence of invariable uniformities of sequence of this kind, or that\\r\\nit aims at discovering them. all such uniformities, as we saw, depend\\r\\nupon a certain vagueness in the definition of the \"events.\" that\\r\\nbodies fall is a vague qualitative statement; science wishes to know\\r\\nhow fast they fall. this depends upon the shape of the bodies and the\\r\\ndensity of the air. it is true that there is more nearly uniformity\\r\\nwhen they fall in a vacuum; so far as galileo could observe, the\\r\\nuniformity is then complete. but later it appeared that even there the\\r\\nlatitude made a difference, and the altitude. theoretically, the\\r\\nposition of the sun and moon must make a difference. in short, every\\r\\nadvance in a science takes us farther away from the crude uniformities\\r\\nwhich are first observed, into greater differentiation of antecedent\\r\\nand consequent, and into a continually wider circle of antecedents\\r\\nrecognised as relevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe principle \"same cause, same effect,\" which philosophers imagine to\\r\\nbe vital to science, is therefore utterly otiose. as soon as the\\r\\nantecedents have been given sufficiently fully to enable the\\r\\nconsequent to be calculated with some exactitude, the antecedents have\\r\\nbecome so complicated that it is very unlikely they will ever recur.\\r\\nhence, if this were the principle involved, science would remain\\r\\nutterly sterile.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe importance of these considerations lies partly in the fact that\\r\\nthey lead to a more correct account of scientific procedure, partly in\\r\\nthe fact that they remove the analogy with human volition which makes\\r\\nthe conception of cause such a fruitful source of fallacies. the\\r\\nlatter point will become clearer by the help of some illustrations.\\r\\nfor this purpose i shall consider a few maxims which have played a\\r\\ngreat part in the history of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) \"cause and effect must more or less resemble each other.\" this\\r\\nprinciple was prominent in the philosophy of occasionalism, and is\\r\\nstill by no means extinct. it is still often thought, for example,\\r\\nthat mind could not have grown up in a universe which previously\\r\\ncontained nothing mental, and one ground for this belief is that\\r\\nmatter is too dissimilar from mind to have been able to cause it. or,\\r\\nmore particularly, what are termed the nobler parts of our nature are\\r\\nsupposed to be inexplicable, unless the universe always contained\\r\\nsomething at least equally noble which could cause them. all such\\r\\nviews seem to depend upon assuming some unduly simplified law of\\r\\ncausality; for, in any legitimate sense of \"cause\" and \"effect,\"\\r\\nscience seems to show that they are usually very widely dissimilar,\\r\\nthe \"cause\" being, in fact, two states of the whole universe, and the\\r\\n\"effect\" some particular event.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) \"cause is analogous to volition, since there must be an\\r\\nintelligible _nexus_ between cause and effect.\" this maxim is, i\\r\\nthink, often unconsciously in the imaginations of philosophers who\\r\\nwould reject it when explicitly stated. it is probably operative in\\r\\nthe view we have just been considering, that mind could not have\\r\\nresulted from a purely material world. i do not profess to know what\\r\\nis meant by \"intelligible\"; it seems to mean \"familiar to\\r\\nimagination.\" nothing is less \"intelligible,\" in any other sense, than\\r\\nthe connection between an act of will and its fulfilment. but\\r\\nobviously the sort of nexus desired between cause and effect is such\\r\\nas could only hold between the \"events\" which the supposed law of\\r\\ncausality contemplates; the laws which replace causality in such a\\r\\nscience as physics leave no room for any two events between which a\\r\\nnexus could be sought.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) \"the cause _compels_ the effect in some sense in which the effect\\r\\ndoes not compel the cause.\" this belief seems largely operative in the\\r\\ndislike of determinism; but, as a matter of fact, it is connected with\\r\\nour second maxim, and falls as soon as that is abandoned. we may\\r\\ndefine \"compulsion\" as follows: \"any set of circumstances is said to\\r\\ncompel a when a desires to do something which the circumstances\\r\\nprevent, or to abstain from something which the circumstances cause.\"\\r\\nthis presupposes that some meaning has been found for the word\\r\\n\"cause\"--a point to which i shall return later. what i want to make\\r\\nclear at present is that compulsion is a very complex notion,\\r\\ninvolving thwarted desire. so long as a person does what he wishes to\\r\\ndo, there is no compulsion, however much his wishes may be calculable\\r\\nby the help of earlier events. and where desire does not come in,\\r\\nthere can be no question of compulsion. hence it is, in general,\\r\\nmisleading to regard the cause as compelling the effect.\\r\\n\\r\\na vaguer form of the same maxim substitutes the word \"determine\" for\\r\\nthe word \"compel\"; we are told that the cause _determines_ the effect\\r\\nin a sense in which the effect does not _determine_ the cause. it is\\r\\nnot quite clear what is meant by \"determining\"; the only precise\\r\\nsense, so far as i know, is that of a function or one-many relation.\\r\\nif we admit plurality of causes, but not of effects, that is, if we\\r\\nsuppose that, given the cause, the effect must be such and such, but,\\r\\ngiven the effect, the cause may have been one of many alternatives,\\r\\nthen we may say that the cause determines the effect, but not the\\r\\neffect the cause. plurality of causes, however, results only from\\r\\nconceiving the effect vaguely and narrowly and the cause precisely and\\r\\nwidely. many antecedents may \"cause\" a man\\'s death, because his death\\r\\nis vague and narrow. but if we adopt the opposite course, taking as\\r\\nthe \"cause\" the drinking of a dose of arsenic, and as the \"effect\" the\\r\\nwhole state of the world five minutes later, we shall have plurality\\r\\nof effects instead of plurality of causes. thus the supposed lack of\\r\\nsymmetry between \"cause\" and \"effect\" is illusory.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) \"a cause cannot operate when it has ceased to exist, because what\\r\\nhas ceased to exist is nothing.\" this is a common maxim, and a still\\r\\nmore common unexpressed prejudice. it has, i fancy, a good deal to do\\r\\nwith the attractiveness of bergson\\'s \"_dure_\": since the past has\\r\\neffects now, it must still exist in some sense. the mistake in this\\r\\nmaxim consists in the supposition that causes \"operate\" at all. a\\r\\nvolition \"operates\" when what it wills takes place; but nothing can\\r\\noperate except a volition. the belief that causes \"operate\" results\\r\\nfrom assimilating them, consciously or unconsciously, to volitions. we\\r\\nhave already seen that, if there are causes at all, they must be\\r\\nseparated by a finite interval of time from their effects, and thus\\r\\ncause their effects after they have ceased to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be objected to the above definition of a volition \"operating\"\\r\\nthat it only operates when it \"causes\" what it wills, not when it\\r\\nmerely happens to be followed by what it wills. this certainly\\r\\nrepresents the usual view of what is meant by a volition \"operating,\"\\r\\nbut as it involves the very view of causation which we are engaged in\\r\\ncombating, it is not open to us as a definition. we may say that a\\r\\nvolition \"operates\" when there is some law in virtue of which a\\r\\nsimilar volition in rather similar circumstances will usually be\\r\\nfollowed by what it wills. but this is a vague conception, and\\r\\nintroduces ideas which we have not yet considered. what is chiefly\\r\\nimportant to notice is that the usual notion of \"operating\" is not\\r\\nopen to us if we reject, as i contend that we should, the usual notion\\r\\nof causation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) \"a cause cannot operate except where it is.\" this maxim is very\\r\\nwidespread; it was urged against newton, and has remained a source of\\r\\nprejudice against \"action at a distance.\" in philosophy it has led to\\r\\na denial of transient action, and thence to monism or leibnizian\\r\\nmonadism. like the analogous maxim concerning temporal contiguity, it\\r\\nrests upon the assumption that causes \"operate,\" i.e. that they are in\\r\\nsome obscure way analogous to volitions. and, as in the case of\\r\\ntemporal contiguity, the inferences drawn from this maxim are wholly\\r\\ngroundless.\\r\\n\\r\\ni return now to the question, what law or laws can be found to take\\r\\nthe place of the supposed law of causality?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, without passing beyond such uniformities of sequence as are\\r\\ncontemplated by the traditional law, we may admit that, if any such\\r\\nsequence has been observed in a great many cases, and has never been\\r\\nfound to fail, there is an inductive probability that it will be found\\r\\nto hold in future cases. if stones have hitherto been found to break\\r\\nwindows, it is probable that they will continue to do so. this, of\\r\\ncourse, assumes the inductive principle, of which the truth may\\r\\nreasonably be questioned; but as this principle is not our present\\r\\nconcern, i shall in this discussion treat it as indubitable. we may\\r\\nthen say, in the case of any such frequently observed sequence, that\\r\\nthe earlier event is the _cause_ and the later event the _effect_.\\r\\n\\r\\nseveral considerations, however, make such special sequences very\\r\\ndifferent from the traditional relation of cause and effect. in the\\r\\nfirst place, the sequence, in any hitherto unobserved instance, is no\\r\\nmore than probable, whereas the relation of cause and effect was\\r\\nsupposed to be necessary. i do not mean by this merely that we are not\\r\\nsure of having discovered a true case of cause and effect; i mean\\r\\nthat, even when we have a case of cause and effect in our present\\r\\nsense, all that is meant is that on grounds of observation, it is\\r\\nprobable that when one occurs the other will also occur. thus in our\\r\\npresent sense, a may be the cause of b even if there actually are\\r\\ncases where b does not follow a. striking a match will be the cause of\\r\\nits igniting, in spite of the fact that some matches are damp and fail\\r\\nto ignite.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the second place, it will not be assumed that _every_ event has\\r\\nsome antecedent which is its cause in this sense; we shall only\\r\\nbelieve in causal sequences where we find them, without any\\r\\npresumption that they always are to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the third place, _any_ case of sufficiently frequent sequence will\\r\\nbe causal in our present sense; for example, we shall not refuse to\\r\\nsay that night is the cause of day. our repugnance to saying this\\r\\narises from the ease with which we can imagine the sequence to fail,\\r\\nbut owing to the fact that cause and effect must be separated by a\\r\\nfinite interval of time, _any_ such sequence _might_ fail through the\\r\\ninterposition of other circumstances in the interval. mill, discussing\\r\\nthis instance of night and day, says:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"it is necessary to our using the word cause, that we should believe\\r\\nnot only that the antecedent always _has_ been followed by the\\r\\nconsequent, but that as long as the present constitution of things\\r\\nendures, it always _will_ be so.\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nin this sense, we shall have to give up the hope of finding causal\\r\\nlaws such as mill contemplated; any causal sequence which we have\\r\\nobserved may at any moment be falsified without a falsification of any\\r\\nlaws of the kind that the more advanced sciences aim at establishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the fourth place, such laws of probable sequence, though useful in\\r\\ndaily life and in the infancy of a science, tend to be displaced by\\r\\nquite different laws as soon as a science is successful. the law of\\r\\ngravitation will illustrate what occurs in any advanced science. in\\r\\nthe motions of mutually gravitating bodies, there is nothing that can\\r\\nbe called a cause, and nothing that can be called an effect; there is\\r\\nmerely a formula. certain differential equations can be found, which\\r\\nhold at every instant for every particle of the system, and which,\\r\\ngiven the configuration and velocities at one instant, or the\\r\\nconfigurations at two instants, render the configuration at any other\\r\\nearlier or later instant theoretically calculable. that is to say, the\\r\\nconfiguration at any instant is a function of that instant and the\\r\\nconfigurations at two given instants. this statement holds throughout\\r\\nphysics, and not only in the special case of gravitation. but there is\\r\\nnothing that could be properly called \"cause\" and nothing that could\\r\\nbe properly called \"effect\" in such a system.\\r\\n\\r\\nno doubt the reason why the old \"law of causality\" has so long\\r\\ncontinued to pervade the books of philosophers is simply that the idea\\r\\nof a function is unfamiliar to most of them, and therefore they seek\\r\\nan unduly simplified statement. there is no question of repetitions of\\r\\nthe \"same\" cause producing the \"same\" effect; it is not in any\\r\\nsameness of causes and effects that the constancy of scientific law\\r\\nconsists, but in sameness of relations. and even \"sameness of\\r\\nrelations\" is too simple a phrase; \"sameness of differential\\r\\nequations\" is the only correct phrase. it is impossible to state this\\r\\naccurately in non-mathematical language; the nearest approach would be\\r\\nas follows: \"there is a constant relation between the state of the\\r\\nuniverse at any instant and the rate of change in the rate at which\\r\\nany part of the universe is changing at that instant, and this\\r\\nrelation is many-one, i.e. such that the rate of change in the rate of\\r\\nchange is determinate when the state of the universe is given.\" if the\\r\\n\"law of causality\" is to be something actually discoverable in the\\r\\npractice of science, the above proposition has a better right to the\\r\\nname than any \"law of causality\" to be found in the books of\\r\\nphilosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to the above principle, several observations must be made--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) no one can pretend that the above principle is _a priori_ or\\r\\nself-evident or a \"necessity of thought.\" nor is it, in any sense, a\\r\\npremiss of science: it is an empirical generalisation from a number of\\r\\nlaws which are themselves empirical generalisations.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the law makes no difference between past and future: the future\\r\\n\"determines\" the past in exactly the same sense in which the past\\r\\n\"determines\" the future. the word \"determine,\" here, has a purely\\r\\nlogical significance: a certain number of variables \"determine\"\\r\\nanother variable if that other variable is a function of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) the law will not be empirically verifiable unless the course of\\r\\nevents within some sufficiently small volume will be approximately\\r\\nthe same in any two states of the universe which only differ in regard\\r\\nto what is at a considerable distance from the small volume in\\r\\nquestion. for example, motions of planets in the solar system must be\\r\\napproximately the same however the fixed stars may be distributed,\\r\\nprovided that all the fixed stars are very much farther from the sun\\r\\nthan the planets are. if gravitation varied directly as the distance,\\r\\nso that the most remote stars made the most difference to the motions\\r\\nof the planets, the world might be just as regular and just as much\\r\\nsubject to mathematical laws as it is at present, but we could never\\r\\ndiscover the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) although the old \"law of causality\" is not assumed by science,\\r\\nsomething which we may call the \"uniformity of nature\" is assumed, or\\r\\nrather is accepted on inductive grounds. the uniformity of nature does\\r\\nnot assert the trivial principle \"same cause, same effect,\" but the\\r\\nprinciple of the permanence of laws. that is to say, when a law\\r\\nexhibiting, e.g. an acceleration as a function of the configuration\\r\\nhas been found to hold throughout the observable past, it is expected\\r\\nthat it will continue to hold in the future, or that, if it does not\\r\\nitself hold, there is some other law, agreeing with the supposed law\\r\\nas regards the past, which will hold for the future. the ground of\\r\\nthis principle is simply the inductive ground that it has been found\\r\\nto be true in very many instances; hence the principle cannot be\\r\\nconsidered certain, but only probable to a degree which cannot be\\r\\naccurately estimated.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe uniformity of nature, in the above sense, although it is assumed\\r\\nin the practice of science, must not, in its generality, be regarded\\r\\nas a kind of major premiss, without which all scientific reasoning\\r\\nwould be in error. the assumption that _all_ laws of nature are\\r\\npermanent has, of course, less probability than the assumption that\\r\\nthis or that particular law is permanent; and the assumption that a\\r\\nparticular law is permanent for all time has less probability than the\\r\\nassumption that it will be valid up to such and such a date. science,\\r\\nin any given case, will assume what the case requires, but no more. in\\r\\nconstructing the _nautical almanac_ for 1915 it will assume that the\\r\\nlaw of gravitation will remain true up to the end of that year; but it\\r\\nwill make no assumption as to 1916 until it comes to the next volume\\r\\nof the almanac. this procedure is, of course, dictated by the fact\\r\\nthat the uniformity of nature is not known _a priori_, but is an\\r\\nempirical generalisation, like \"all men are mortal.\" in all such\\r\\ncases, it is better to argue immediately from the given particular\\r\\ninstances to the new instance, than to argue by way of a major\\r\\npremiss; the conclusion is only probable in either case, but acquires\\r\\na higher probability by the former method than by the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nin all science we have to distinguish two sorts of laws: first, those\\r\\nthat are empirically verifiable but probably only approximate;\\r\\nsecondly, those that are not verifiable, but may be exact. the law of\\r\\ngravitation, for example, in its applications to the solar system, is\\r\\nonly empirically verifiable when it is assumed that matter outside the\\r\\nsolar system may be ignored for such purposes; we believe this to be\\r\\nonly approximately true, but we cannot empirically verify the law of\\r\\nuniversal gravitation which we believe to be exact. this point is very\\r\\nimportant in connection with what we may call \"relatively isolated\\r\\nsystems.\" these may be defined as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\na system relatively isolated during a given period is one which,\\r\\nwithin some assignable margin of error, will behave in the same way\\r\\nthroughout that period, however the rest of the universe may be\\r\\nconstituted.\\r\\n\\r\\na system may be called \"practically isolated\" during a given period\\r\\nif, although there _might_ be states of the rest of the universe which\\r\\nwould produce more than the assigned margin of error, there is reason\\r\\nto believe that such states do not in fact occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nstrictly speaking, we ought to specify the respect in which the system\\r\\nis relatively isolated. for example, the earth is relatively isolated\\r\\nas regards falling bodies, but not as regards tides; it is\\r\\n_practically_ isolated as regards economic phenomena, although, if\\r\\njevons\\' sunspot theory of commercial crises had been true, it would\\r\\nnot have been even practically isolated in this respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be observed that we cannot prove in advance that a system is\\r\\nisolated. this will be inferred from the observed fact that\\r\\napproximate uniformities can be stated for this system alone. if the\\r\\ncomplete laws for the whole universe were known, the isolation of a\\r\\nsystem could be deduced from them; assuming, for example, the law of\\r\\nuniversal gravitation, the practical isolation of the solar system in\\r\\nthis respect can be deduced by the help of the fact that there is very\\r\\nlittle matter in its neighbourhood. but it should be observed that\\r\\nisolated systems are only important as providing a possibility of\\r\\n_discovering_ scientific laws; they have no theoretical importance in\\r\\nthe finished structure of a science.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe case where one event a is said to \"cause\" another event b, which\\r\\nphilosophers take as fundamental, is really only the most simplified\\r\\ninstance of a practically isolated system. it may happen that, as a\\r\\nresult of general scientific laws, whenever a occurs throughout a\\r\\ncertain period, it is followed by b; in that case, a and b form a\\r\\nsystem which is practically isolated throughout that period. it is,\\r\\nhowever, to be regarded as a piece of good fortune if this occurs; it\\r\\nwill always be due to special circumstances, and would not have been\\r\\ntrue if the rest of the universe had been different though subject to\\r\\nthe same laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe essential function which causality has been supposed to perform is\\r\\nthe possibility of inferring the future from the past, or, more\\r\\ngenerally, events at any time from events at certain assigned times.\\r\\nany system in which such inference is possible may be called a\\r\\n\"deterministic\" system. we may define a deterministic system as\\r\\nfollows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  a system is said to be \"deterministic\" when, given certain data,\\r\\n  [math: e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n}, at times t_{1}, t_{2}, ...,\\r\\n  t_{n}] respectively, concerning this system, if [math: e_{t}] is\\r\\n  the state of the system at any time _t_, there is a functional\\r\\n  relation of the form\\r\\n\\r\\n[math: e_{t} = f (e_{1}, t_{1}, e_{2}, t_{2}, ..., e_{n}, t_{n}, t)]. (a)\\r\\n\\r\\n  the system will be \"deterministic throughout a given period\" if\\r\\n  _t_, in the above formula, may be any time within that period,\\r\\n  though outside that period the formula may be no longer true. if\\r\\n  the universe, as a whole, is such a system, determinism is true of\\r\\n  the universe; if not, not. a system which is part of a\\r\\n  deterministic system i shall call \"determined\"; one which is not\\r\\n  part of any such system i shall call \"capricious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe events [math: e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n}] i shall call \"determinants\"\\r\\nof the system. it is to be observed that a system which has one set of\\r\\ndeterminants will in general have many. in the case of the motions of\\r\\nthe planets, for example, the configurations of the solar system at any\\r\\ntwo given times will be determinants.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may take another illustration from the hypothesis of\\r\\npsycho-physical parallelism. let us assume, for the purposes of this\\r\\nillustration, that to a given state of brain a given state of mind\\r\\nalways corresponds, and vice versa, i.e. that there is a one-one\\r\\nrelation between them, so that each is a function of the other. we may\\r\\nalso assume, what is practically certain, that to a given state of a\\r\\ncertain brain a given state of the whole material universe\\r\\ncorresponds, since it is highly improbable that a given brain is ever\\r\\ntwice in exactly the same state. hence there will be a one-one\\r\\nrelation between the state of a given person\\'s mind and the state of\\r\\nthe whole material universe. it follows that, if _n_ states of the\\r\\nmaterial universe are determinants of the material universe, then _n_\\r\\nstates of a given man\\'s mind are determinants of the whole material\\r\\nand mental universe--assuming, that is to say, that psycho-physical\\r\\nparallelism is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above illustration is important in connection with a certain\\r\\nconfusion which seems to have beset those who have philosophised on\\r\\nthe relation of mind and matter. it is often thought that, if the\\r\\nstate of the mind is determinate when the state of the brain is given,\\r\\nand if the material world forms a deterministic system, then mind is\\r\\n\"subject\" to matter in some sense in which matter is not \"subject\" to\\r\\nmind. but if the state of the brain is also determinate when the state\\r\\nof the mind is given, it must be exactly as true to regard matter as\\r\\nsubject to mind as it would be to regard mind as subject to matter. we\\r\\ncould, theoretically, work out the history of mind without ever\\r\\nmentioning matter, and then, at the end, deduce that matter must\\r\\nmeanwhile have gone through the corresponding history. it is true that\\r\\nif the relation of brain to mind were many-one, not one-one, there\\r\\nwould be a one-sided dependence of mind on brain, while conversely, if\\r\\nthe relation were one-many, as bergson supposes, there would be a\\r\\none-aided dependence of brain on mind. but the dependence involved is,\\r\\nin any case, only logical; it does not mean that we shall be\\r\\ncompelled to do things we desire not to do, which is what people\\r\\ninstinctively imagine it to mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nas another illustration we may take the case of mechanism and\\r\\nteleology. a system may be defined as \"mechanical\" when it has a set\\r\\nof determinants that are purely material, such as the positions of\\r\\ncertain pieces of matter at certain times. it is an open question\\r\\nwhether the world of mind and matter, as we know it, is a mechanical\\r\\nsystem or not; let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that it is a\\r\\nmechanical system. this supposition--so i contend--throws no light\\r\\nwhatever on the question whether the universe is or is not a\\r\\n\"teleological\" system. it is difficult to define accurately what is\\r\\nmeant by a \"teleological\" system, but the argument is not much\\r\\naffected by the particular definition we adopt. broadly, a\\r\\nteleological system is one in which purposes are realised, i.e. in\\r\\nwhich certain desires--those that are deeper or nobler or more\\r\\nfundamental or more universal or what not--are followed by their\\r\\nrealisation. now the fact--if it be a fact--that the universe is\\r\\nmechanical has no bearing whatever on the question whether it is\\r\\nteleological in the above sense. there might be a mechanical system in\\r\\nwhich all wishes were realised, and there might be one in which all\\r\\nwishes were thwarted. the question whether, or how far, our actual\\r\\nworld is teleological, cannot, therefore, be settled by proving that\\r\\nit is mechanical, and the desire that it should be teleological is no\\r\\nground for wishing it to be not mechanical.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, in all these questions, a very great difficulty in avoiding\\r\\nconfusion between what we can infer and what is in fact determined.\\r\\nlet us consider, for a moment, the various senses in which the future\\r\\nmay be \"determined.\" there is one sense--and a very important one--in\\r\\nwhich it is determined quite independently of scientific laws, namely,\\r\\nthe sense that it will be what it will be. we all regard the past as\\r\\ndetermined simply by the fact that it has happened; but for the\\r\\naccident that memory works backward and not forward, we should regard\\r\\nthe future as equally determined by the fact that it will happen.\\r\\n\"but,\" we are told, \"you cannot alter the past, while you can to some\\r\\nextent alter the future.\" this view seems to me to rest upon just\\r\\nthose errors in regard to causation which it has been my object to\\r\\nremove. you cannot make the past other than it was--true, but this is\\r\\na mere application of the law of contradiction. if you already know\\r\\nwhat the past was, obviously it is useless to wish it different. but\\r\\nalso you cannot make the future other than it will be; this again is\\r\\nan application of the law of contradiction. and if you happen to know\\r\\nthe future--e.g. in the case of a forthcoming eclipse--it is just as\\r\\nuseless to wish it different as to wish the past different. \"but,\" it\\r\\nwill be rejoined, \"our wishes can _cause_ the future, sometimes, to be\\r\\ndifferent from what it would be if they did not exist, and they can\\r\\nhave no such effect upon the past.\" this, again, is a mere tautology.\\r\\nan effect being _defined_ as something subsequent to its cause,\\r\\nobviously we can have no _effect_ upon the past. but that does not\\r\\nmean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes\\r\\nhad been different. obviously, our present wishes are conditioned by\\r\\nthe past, and therefore could not have been different unless the past\\r\\nhad been different; therefore, if our present wishes were different,\\r\\nthe past would be different. of course, the past cannot be different\\r\\nfrom what it was, but no more can our present wishes be different from\\r\\nwhat they are; this again is merely the law of contradiction. the\\r\\nfacts seem to be merely (1) that wishing generally depends upon\\r\\nignorance, and is therefore commoner in regard to the future than in\\r\\nregard to the past; (2) that where a wish concerns the future, it and\\r\\nits realisation very often form a \"practically independent system,\"\\r\\ni.e. many wishes regarding the future are realised. but there seems no\\r\\ndoubt that the main difference in our feelings arises from the\\r\\naccidental fact that the past but not the future can be known by\\r\\nmemory.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough the sense of \"determined\" in which the future is determined\\r\\nby the mere fact that it will be what it will be is sufficient (at\\r\\nleast so it seems to me) to refute some opponents of determinism,\\r\\nnotably m. bergson and the pragmatists, yet it is not what most people\\r\\nhave in mind when they speak of the future as determined. what they\\r\\nhave in mind is a formula by means of which the future can be\\r\\nexhibited, and at least theoretically calculated, as a function of the\\r\\npast. but at this point we meet with a great difficulty, which besets\\r\\nwhat has been said above about deterministic systems, as well as what\\r\\nis said by others.\\r\\n\\r\\nif formul of any degree of complexity, however great, are admitted,\\r\\nit would seem that any system, whose state at a given moment is a\\r\\nfunction of certain measurable quantities, must be a deterministic\\r\\nsystem. let us consider, in illustration, a single material particle,\\r\\nwhose co-ordinates at time _t_ are [math: x_{t}, y_{t}, z_{t}]. then,\\r\\nhowever, the particle moves, there must be, theoretically, functions\\r\\n[math: f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}], such that\\r\\n\\r\\n[math: x_{t} = f_{t}(t), y_{t} = f_{2}(t), z_{t} = f_{3}(t).]\\r\\n\\r\\nit follows that, theoretically, the whole state of the material\\r\\nuniverse at time _t_ must be capable of being exhibited as a function\\r\\nof _t_. hence our universe will be deterministic in the sense defined\\r\\nabove. but if this be true, no information is conveyed about the\\r\\nuniverse in stating that it is deterministic. it is true that the\\r\\nformul involved may be of strictly infinite complexity, and therefore\\r\\nnot practically capable of being written down or apprehended. but\\r\\nexcept from the point of view of our knowledge, this might seem to be\\r\\na detail: in itself, if the above considerations are sound, the\\r\\nmaterial universe _must_ be deterministic, _must_ be subject to laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis, however, is plainly not what was intended. the difference\\r\\nbetween this view and the view intended may be seen as follows. given\\r\\nsome formula which fits the facts hitherto--say the law of\\r\\ngravitation--there will be an infinite number of other formul, not\\r\\nempirically distinguishable from it in the past, but diverging from it\\r\\nmore and more in the future. hence, even assuming that there are\\r\\npersistent laws, we shall have no reason for assuming that the law of\\r\\nthe inverse square will hold in future; it may be some other hitherto\\r\\nindistinguishable law that will hold. we cannot say that _every_ law\\r\\nwhich has held hitherto must hold in the future, because past facts\\r\\nwhich obey one law will also obey others, hitherto indistinguishable\\r\\nbut diverging in future. hence there must, at every moment, be laws\\r\\nhitherto unbroken which are now broken for the first time. what\\r\\nscience does, in fact, is to select the _simplest_ formula that will\\r\\nfit the facts. but this, quite obviously, is merely a methodological\\r\\nprecept, not a law of nature. if the simplest formula ceases, after a\\r\\ntime, to be applicable, the simplest formula that remains applicable\\r\\nis selected, and science has no sense that an axiom has been\\r\\nfalsified. we are thus left with the brute fact that, in many\\r\\ndepartments of science, quite simple laws have hitherto been found to\\r\\nhold. this fact cannot be regarded as having any _a priori_ ground,\\r\\nnor can it be used to support inductively the opinion that the same\\r\\nlaws will continue; for at every moment laws hitherto true are being\\r\\nfalsified, though in the advanced sciences these laws are less simple\\r\\nthan those that have remained true. moreover it would be fallacious to\\r\\nargue inductively from the state of the advanced sciences to the\\r\\nfuture state of the others, for it may well be that the advanced\\r\\nsciences are advanced simply because, hitherto, their subject-matter\\r\\nhas obeyed simple and easily ascertainable laws, while the\\r\\nsubject-matter of other sciences has not done so.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difficulty we have been considering seems to be met partly, if not\\r\\nwholly, by the principle that the _time_ must not enter explicitly\\r\\ninto our formul. all mechanical laws exhibit acceleration as a\\r\\nfunction of configuration, not of configuration and time jointly; and\\r\\nthis principle of the irrelevance of the time may be extended to all\\r\\nscientific laws. in fact we might interpret the \"uniformity of nature\"\\r\\nas meaning just this, that no scientific law involves the time as an\\r\\nargument, unless, of course, it is given in an integrated form, in\\r\\nwhich case _lapse_ of time, though not absolute time, may appear in\\r\\nour formul. whether this consideration suffices to overcome our\\r\\ndifficulty completely, i do not know; but in any case it does much to\\r\\ndiminish it.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will serve to illustrate what has been said if we apply it to the\\r\\nquestion of free will.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) determinism in regard to the will is the doctrine that our\\r\\nvolitions belong to some deterministic system, i.e. are \"determined\"\\r\\nin the sense defined above. whether this doctrine is true or false, is\\r\\na mere question of fact; no _a priori_ considerations (if our previous\\r\\ndiscussions have been correct) can exist on either side. on the one\\r\\nhand, there is no _a priori_ category of causality, but merely certain\\r\\nobserved uniformities. as a matter of fact, there are observed\\r\\nuniformities in regard to volitions; thus there is some empirical\\r\\nevidence that volitions are determined. but it would be very rash to\\r\\nmaintain that the evidence is overwhelming, and it is quite possible\\r\\nthat some volitions, as well as some other things, are not determined,\\r\\nexcept in the sense in which we found that everything must be\\r\\ndetermined.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) but, on the other hand, the subjective sense of freedom, sometimes\\r\\nalleged against determinism, has no bearing on the question whatever.\\r\\nthe view that it has a bearing rests upon the belief that causes\\r\\ncompel their effects, or that nature enforces obedience to its laws as\\r\\ngovernments do. these are mere anthropomorphic superstitions, due to\\r\\nassimilation of causes with volitions and of natural laws with human\\r\\nedicts. we feel that our will is not compelled, but that only means\\r\\nthat it is not other than we choose it to be. it is one of the\\r\\ndemerits of the traditional theory of causality that it has created an\\r\\nartificial opposition between determinism and the freedom of which we\\r\\nare introspectively conscious.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) besides the general question whether volitions are determined,\\r\\nthere is the further question whether they are _mechanically_\\r\\ndetermined, i.e. whether they are part of what was above defined as a\\r\\nmechanical system. this is the question whether they form part of a\\r\\nsystem with purely material determinants, i.e. whether there are laws\\r\\nwhich, given certain material data, make all volitions functions of\\r\\nthose data. here again, there is empirical evidence up to a point, but\\r\\nit is not conclusive in regard to all volitions. it is important to\\r\\nobserve, however that even if volitions are part of a mechanical\\r\\nsystem, this by no means implies any supremacy of matter over mind. it\\r\\nmay well be that the same system which is susceptible of material\\r\\ndeterminants is also susceptible of mental determinants; thus a\\r\\nmechanical system may be determined by sets of volitions, as well as\\r\\nby sets of material facts. it would seem, therefore, that the reasons\\r\\nwhich make people dislike the view that volitions are mechanically\\r\\ndetermined are fallacious.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) the notion of _necessity_, which is often associated with\\r\\ndeterminism, is a confused notion not legitimately deducible from\\r\\ndeterminism. three meanings are commonly confounded when necessity is\\r\\nspoken of:--\\r\\n\\r\\n() an _action_ is necessary when it will be performed however much\\r\\nthe agent may wish to do otherwise. determinism does not imply that\\r\\nactions are necessary in this sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n() a _propositional function_ is necessary when all its values are\\r\\ntrue. this sense is not relevant to our present discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n() a _proposition_ is necessary with respect to a given constituent\\r\\nwhen it is the value, with that constituent as argument, of a\\r\\nnecessary propositional function, in other words, when it remains true\\r\\nhowever that constituent may be varied. in this sense, in a\\r\\ndeterministic system, the connection of a volition with its\\r\\ndeterminants is necessary, if the time at which the determinants occur\\r\\nbe taken as the constituent to be varied, the time-interval between\\r\\nthe determinants and the volition being kept constant. but this sense\\r\\nof necessity is purely logical, and has no emotional importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now sum up our discussion of causality. we found first that the\\r\\nlaw of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is\\r\\nnot employed in science. we then considered the nature of scientific\\r\\nlaws, and found that, instead of stating that one event a is always\\r\\nfollowed by another event b, they stated functional relations between\\r\\ncertain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and\\r\\nother events at earlier or later times or at the same time. we were\\r\\nunable to find any _a priori_ category involved: the existence of\\r\\nscientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily\\r\\nuniversal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form. we\\r\\nfound that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have\\r\\nother sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a\\r\\nmechanically determined system may also be teleologically or\\r\\nvolitionally determined. finally we considered the problem of free\\r\\nwill: here we found that the reasons for supposing volitions to be\\r\\ndetermined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if\\r\\nvolitions are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying\\r\\nfreedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that\\r\\nmechanical events are not determined by volitions. the problem of free\\r\\nwill _versus_ determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly\\r\\nillusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[35] a propositional function is an expression containing a variable,\\r\\nor undetermined constituent, and becoming a proposition as soon as a\\r\\ndefinite value is assigned to the variable. examples are: \"a is a,\"\\r\\n\"_x_ is a number.\" the variable is called the _argument_ of the\\r\\nfunction.\\r\\n\\r\\n[36] _logic_, bk. iii, chap. v,  2.\\r\\n\\r\\n[37] _time and free will_, p. 199.\\r\\n\\r\\n[38] _time and free will._ p. 202.\\r\\n\\r\\n[39] _loc. cit._,  6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\nknowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe object of the following paper is to consider what it is that we\\r\\nknow in cases where we know propositions about \"the so-and-so\" without\\r\\nknowing who or what the so-and-so is. for example, i know that the\\r\\ncandidate who gets most votes will be elected, though i do not know\\r\\nwho is the candidate who will get most votes. the problem i wish to\\r\\nconsider is: what do we know in these cases, where the subject is\\r\\nmerely described? i have considered this problem elsewhere[40] from a\\r\\npurely logical point of view; but in what follows i wish to consider\\r\\nthe question in relation to theory of knowledge as well as in relation\\r\\nto logic, and in view of the above-mentioned logical discussions, i\\r\\nshall in this paper make the logical portion as brief as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to make clear the antithesis between \"acquaintance\" and\\r\\n\"description,\" i shall first of all try to explain what i mean by\\r\\n\"acquaintance.\" i say that i am _acquainted_ with an object when i\\r\\nhave a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when i am\\r\\ndirectly aware of the object itself. when i speak of a cognitive\\r\\nrelation here, i do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\\r\\njudgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation. in fact, i\\r\\nthink the relation of subject and object which i call acquaintance is\\r\\nsimply the converse of the relation of object and subject which\\r\\nconstitutes presentation. that is, to say that s has acquaintance with\\r\\no is essentially the same thing as to say that o is presented to s.\\r\\nbut the associations and natural extensions of the word _acquaintance_\\r\\nare different from those of the word _presentation_. to begin with, as\\r\\nin most cognitive words, it is natural to say that i am acquainted\\r\\nwith an object even at moments when it is not actually before my mind,\\r\\nprovided it has been before my mind, and will be again whenever\\r\\noccasion arises. this is the same sense in which i am said to know\\r\\nthat 2+2=4 even when i am thinking of something else. in the second\\r\\nplace, the word _acquaintance_ is designed to emphasise, more than the\\r\\nword _presentation_, the relational character of the fact with which\\r\\nwe are concerned. there is, to my mind, a danger that, in speaking of\\r\\npresentation, we may so emphasise the object as to lose sight of the\\r\\nsubject. the result of this is either to lead to the view that there\\r\\nis no subject, whence we arrive at materialism; or to lead to the view\\r\\nthat what is presented is part of the subject, whence we arrive at\\r\\nidealism, and should arrive at solipsism but for the most desperate\\r\\ncontortions. now i wish to preserve the dualism of subject and object\\r\\nin my terminology, because this dualism seems to me a fundamental fact\\r\\nconcerning cognition. hence i prefer the word _acquaintance_ because\\r\\nit emphasises the need of a subject which is acquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we ask what are the kinds of objects with which we are\\r\\nacquainted, the first and most obvious example is _sense-data_. when i\\r\\nsee a colour or hear a noise, i have direct acquaintance with the\\r\\ncolour or the noise. the sense-datum with which i am acquainted in\\r\\nthese cases is generally, if not always, complex. this is\\r\\nparticularly obvious in the case of sight. i do not mean, of course,\\r\\nmerely that the supposed physical object is complex, but that the\\r\\ndirect sensible object is complex and contains parts with spatial\\r\\nrelations. whether it is possible to be aware of a complex without\\r\\nbeing aware of its constituents is not an easy question, but on the\\r\\nwhole it would seem that there is no reason why it should not be\\r\\npossible. this question arises in an acute form in connection with\\r\\nself-consciousness, which we must now briefly consider.\\r\\n\\r\\nin introspection, we seem to be immediately aware of varying\\r\\ncomplexes, consisting of objects in various cognitive and conative\\r\\nrelations to ourselves. when i see the sun, it often happens that i\\r\\nam aware of my seeing the sun, in addition to being aware of the sun;\\r\\nand when i desire food, it often happens that i am aware of my desire\\r\\nfor food. but it is hard to discover any state of mind in which i am\\r\\naware of myself alone, as opposed to a complex of which i am a\\r\\nconstituent. the question of the nature of self-consciousness is too\\r\\nlarge and too slightly connected with our subject, to be argued at\\r\\nlength here. it is difficult, but probably not impossible, to account\\r\\nfor plain facts if we assume that we do not have acquaintance with\\r\\nourselves. it is plain that we are not only _acquainted_ with the\\r\\ncomplex \"self-acquainted-with-a,\" but we also _know_ the proposition\\r\\n\"i am acquainted with a.\" now here the complex has been analysed, and\\r\\nif \"i\" does not stand for something which is a direct object of\\r\\nacquaintance, we shall have to suppose that \"i\" is something known by\\r\\ndescription. if we wished to maintain the view that there is no\\r\\nacquaintance with self, we might argue as follows: we are acquainted\\r\\nwith _acquaintance_, and we know that it is a relation. also we are\\r\\nacquainted with a complex in which we perceive that acquaintance is\\r\\nthe relating relation. hence we know that this complex must have a\\r\\nconstituent which is that which is acquainted, i.e. must have a\\r\\nsubject-term as well as an object-term. this subject-term we define\\r\\nas \"i.\" thus \"i\" means \"the subject-term in awarenesses of which _i_\\r\\nam aware.\" but as a definition this cannot be regarded as a happy\\r\\neffort. it would seem necessary, therefore, either to suppose that i\\r\\nam acquainted with myself, and that \"i,\" therefore, requires no\\r\\ndefinition, being merely the proper name of a certain object, or to\\r\\nfind some other analysis of self-consciousness. thus self-consciousness\\r\\ncannot be regarded as throwing light on the question whether we can\\r\\nknow a complex without knowing its constituents. this question,\\r\\nhowever, is not important for our present purposes, and i shall\\r\\ntherefore not discuss it further.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe awarenesses we have considered so far have all been awarenesses of\\r\\nparticular existents, and might all in a large sense be called\\r\\nsense-data. for, from the point of view of theory of knowledge,\\r\\nintrospective knowledge is exactly on a level with knowledge derived\\r\\nfrom sight or hearing. but, in addition to awareness of the above kind\\r\\nof objects, which may be called awareness of _particulars_; we have\\r\\nalso (though not quite in the same sense) what may be called awareness\\r\\nof _universals_. awareness of universals is called _conceiving_, and a\\r\\nuniversal of which we are aware is called a _concept_. not only are we\\r\\naware of particular yellows, but if we have seen a sufficient number\\r\\nof yellows and have sufficient intelligence, we are aware of the\\r\\nuniversal _yellow_; this universal is the subject in such judgments as\\r\\n\"yellow differs from blue\" or \"yellow resembles blue less than green\\r\\ndoes.\" and the universal yellow is the predicate in such judgments as\\r\\n\"this is yellow,\" where \"this\" is a particular sense-datum. and\\r\\nuniversal relations, too, are objects of awarenesses; up and down,\\r\\nbefore and after, resemblance, desire, awareness itself, and so on,\\r\\nwould seem to be all of them objects of which we can be aware.\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to relations, it might be urged that we are never aware of\\r\\nthe universal relation itself, but only of complexes in which it is a\\r\\nconstituent. for example, it may be said that we do not know directly\\r\\nsuch a relation as _before_, though we understand such a proposition\\r\\nas \"this is before that,\" and may be directly aware of such a complex\\r\\nas \"this being before that.\" this view, however, is difficult to\\r\\nreconcile with the fact that we often know propositions in which the\\r\\nrelation is the subject, or in which the relata are not definite given\\r\\nobjects, but \"anything.\" for example, we know that if one thing is\\r\\nbefore another, and the other before a third, then the first is before\\r\\nthe third; and here the things concerned are not definite things, but\\r\\n\"anything.\" it is hard to see how we could know such a fact about\\r\\n\"before\" unless we were acquainted with \"before,\" and not merely with\\r\\nactual particular cases of one given object being before another given\\r\\nobject. and more directly: a judgment such as \"this is before that,\"\\r\\nwhere this judgment is derived from awareness of a complex,\\r\\nconstitutes an analysis, and we should not understand the analysis if\\r\\nwe were not acquainted with the meaning of the terms employed. thus we\\r\\nmust suppose that we are acquainted with the meaning of \"before,\" and\\r\\nnot merely with instances of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are thus at least two sorts of objects of which we are aware,\\r\\nnamely, particulars and universals. among particulars i include all\\r\\nexistents, and all complexes of which one or more constituents are\\r\\nexistents, such as this-before-that, this-above-that,\\r\\nthe-yellowness-of-this. among universals i include all objects of\\r\\nwhich no particular is a constituent. thus the disjunction\\r\\n\"universal-particular\" includes all objects. we might also call it the\\r\\ndisjunction \"abstract-concrete.\" it is not quite parallel with the\\r\\nopposition \"concept-percept,\" because things remembered or imagined\\r\\nbelong with particulars, but can hardly be called percepts. (on the\\r\\nother hand, universals with which we are acquainted may be identified\\r\\nwith concepts.)\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that among the objects with which we are acquainted\\r\\nare not included physical objects (as opposed to sense-data), nor\\r\\nother people\\'s minds. these things are known to us by what i call\\r\\n\"knowledge by description,\" which we must now consider.\\r\\n\\r\\nby a \"description\" i mean any phrase of the form \"a so-and-so\" or \"the\\r\\nso-and-so.\" a phrase of the form \"a so-and-so\" i shall call an\\r\\n\"ambiguous\" description; a phrase of the form \"the so-and-so\" (in the\\r\\nsingular) i shall call a \"definite\" description. thus \"a man\" is an\\r\\nambiguous description, and \"the man with the iron mask\" is a definite\\r\\ndescription. there are various problems connected with ambiguous\\r\\ndescriptions, but i pass them by, since they do not directly concern\\r\\nthe matter i wish to discuss. what i wish to discuss is the nature of\\r\\nour knowledge concerning objects in cases where we know that there is\\r\\nan object answering to a definite description, though we are not\\r\\n_acquainted_ with any such object. this is a matter which is concerned\\r\\nexclusively with _definite_ descriptions. i shall, therefore, in the\\r\\nsequel, speak simply of \"descriptions\" when i mean \"definite\\r\\ndescriptions.\" thus a description will mean any phrase of the form\\r\\n\"the so-and-so\" in the singular.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall say that an object is \"known by description\" when we know that\\r\\nit is \"_the_ so-and-so,\" i.e. when we know that there is one object,\\r\\nand no more, having a certain property; and it will generally be\\r\\nimplied that we do not have knowledge of the same object by\\r\\nacquaintance. we know that the man with the iron mask existed, and\\r\\nmany propositions are known about him; but we do not know who he was.\\r\\nwe know that the candidate who gets most votes will be elected, and in\\r\\nthis case we are very likely also acquainted (in the only sense in\\r\\nwhich one can be acquainted with some one else) with the man who is,\\r\\nin fact, the candidate who will get most votes, but we do not know\\r\\nwhich of the candidates he is, i.e. we do not know any proposition of\\r\\nthe form \"a is the candidate who will get most votes\" where a is one\\r\\nof the candidates by name. we shall say that we have \"_merely_\\r\\ndescriptive knowledge\" of the so-and-so when, although we know that\\r\\nthe so-and-so exists, and although we may possibly be acquainted with\\r\\nthe object which is, in fact, the so-and-so, yet we do not know any\\r\\nproposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so,\" where _a_ is something with which\\r\\nwe are acquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we say \"the so-and-so exists,\" we mean that there is just one\\r\\nobject which is the so-and-so. the proposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so\"\\r\\nmeans that _a_ has the property so-and-so, and nothing else has. \"sir\\r\\njoseph larmor is the unionist candidate\" means \"sir joseph larmor is a\\r\\nunionist candidate, and no one else is.\" \"the unionist candidate\\r\\nexists\" means \"some one is a unionist candidate, and no one else is.\"\\r\\nthus, when we are acquainted with an object which we know to be the\\r\\nso-and-so, we know that the so-and-so exists but we may know that the\\r\\nso-and-so exists when we are not acquainted with any object which we\\r\\nknow to be the so-and-so, and even when we are not acquainted with any\\r\\nobject which, in fact, is the so-and-so.\\r\\n\\r\\ncommon words, even proper names, are usually really descriptions. that\\r\\nis to say, the thought in the mind of a person using a proper name\\r\\ncorrectly can generally only be expressed explicitly if we replace the\\r\\nproper name by a description. moreover, the description required to\\r\\nexpress the thought will vary for different people, or for the same\\r\\nperson at different times. the only thing constant (so long as the\\r\\nname is rightly used) is the object to which the name applies. but so\\r\\nlong as this remains constant, the particular description involved\\r\\nusually makes no difference to the truth or falsehood of the\\r\\nproposition in which the name appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take some illustrations. suppose some statement made about\\r\\nbismarck. assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance\\r\\nwith oneself, bismarck himself might have used his name directly to\\r\\ndesignate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. in this\\r\\ncase, if he made a judgment about himself, he himself might be a\\r\\nconstituent of the judgment. here the proper name has the direct use\\r\\nwhich it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain\\r\\nobject, and not for a description of the object. but if a person who\\r\\nknew bismarck made a judgment about him, the case is different. what\\r\\nthis person was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he\\r\\nconnected (rightly, we will suppose) with bismarck\\'s body. his body as\\r\\na physical object, and still more his mind, were only known as the\\r\\nbody and the mind connected with these sense-data. that is, they were\\r\\nknown by description. it is, of course, very much a matter of chance\\r\\nwhich characteristics of a man\\'s appearance will come into a friend\\'s\\r\\nmind when he thinks of him; thus the description actually in the\\r\\nfriend\\'s mind is accidental. the essential point is that he knows that\\r\\nthe various descriptions all apply to the same entity, in spite of\\r\\nnot being acquainted with the entity in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we, who did not know bismarck, make a judgment about him, the\\r\\ndescription in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass\\r\\nof historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to\\r\\nidentify him. but, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\\r\\nthink of him as \"the first chancellor of the german empire.\" here all\\r\\nthe words are abstract except \"german.\" the word \"german\" will again\\r\\nhave different meanings for different people. to some it will recall\\r\\ntravels in germany, to some the look of germany on the map, and so on.\\r\\nbut if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable,\\r\\nwe shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a\\r\\nparticular with which we are acquainted. such reference is involved in\\r\\nany mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite\\r\\ndates), or of here and there, or of what others have told us. thus it\\r\\nwould seem that, in some way or other, a description known to be\\r\\napplicable to a particular must involve some reference to a particular\\r\\nwith which we are acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing\\r\\ndescribed is not to be merely what follows logically from the\\r\\ndescription. for example, \"the most long-lived of men\" is a\\r\\ndescription which must apply to some man, but we can make no judgments\\r\\nconcerning this man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the\\r\\ndescription gives. if, however, we say, \"the first chancellor of the\\r\\ngerman empire was an astute diplomatist,\" we can only be assured of\\r\\nthe truth of our judgment in virtue of something with which we are\\r\\nacquainted--usually a testimony heard or read. considered\\r\\npsychologically, apart from the information we convey to others, apart\\r\\nfrom the fact about the actual bismarck, which gives importance to\\r\\nour judgment, the thought we really have contains the one or more\\r\\nparticulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts. all\\r\\nnames of places--london, england, europe, the earth, the solar\\r\\nsystem--similarly involve, when used, descriptions which start from\\r\\nsome one or more particulars with which we are acquainted. i suspect\\r\\nthat even the universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a\\r\\nconnection with particulars. in logic, on the contrary, where we are\\r\\nconcerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or\\r\\ncould exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem that, when we make a statement about something only\\r\\nknown by description, we often _intend_ to make our statement, not in\\r\\nthe form involving the description, but about the actual thing\\r\\ndescribed. that is to say, when we say anything about bismarck, we\\r\\nshould like, if we could, to make the judgment which bismarck alone\\r\\ncan make, namely, the judgment of which he himself is a constituent.\\r\\nin this we are necessarily defeated, since the actual bismarck is\\r\\nunknown to us. but we know that there is an object b called bismarck,\\r\\nand that b was an astute diplomatist. we can thus _describe_ the\\r\\nproposition we should like to affirm, namely, \"b was an astute\\r\\ndiplomatist,\" where b is the object which was bismarck. what enables\\r\\nus to communicate in spite of the varying descriptions we employ is\\r\\nthat we know there is a true proposition concerning the actual\\r\\nbismarck, and that, however we may vary the description (so long as\\r\\nthe description is correct), the proposition described is still the\\r\\nsame. this proposition, which is described and is known to be true, is\\r\\nwhat interests us; but we are not acquainted with the proposition\\r\\nitself, and do not know _it_, though we know it is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from\\r\\nacquaintance with particulars: there is bismarck to people who knew\\r\\nhim, bismarck to those who only know of him through history, the man\\r\\nwith the iron mask, the longest-lived of men. these are progressively\\r\\nfurther removed from acquaintance with particulars, and there is a\\r\\nsimilar hierarchy in the region of universals. many universals, like\\r\\nmany particulars, are only known to us by description. but here, as in\\r\\nthe case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by\\r\\ndescription is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is\\r\\nknown by acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fundamental epistemological principle in the analysis of\\r\\npropositions containing descriptions is this: _every proposition which\\r\\nwe can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which\\r\\nwe are acquainted._ from what has been said already, it will be plain\\r\\nwhy i advocate this principle, and how i propose to meet the case of\\r\\npropositions which at first sight contravene it. let us begin with the\\r\\nreasons for supposing the principle true.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe chief reason for supposing the principle true is that it seems\\r\\nscarcely possible to believe that we can make a judgment or entertain\\r\\na supposition without knowing what it is that we are judging or\\r\\nsupposing about. if we make a judgment about (say) julius csar, it is\\r\\nplain that the actual person who was julius csar is not a constituent\\r\\nof the judgment. but before going further, it may be well to explain\\r\\nwhat i mean when i say that this or that is a constituent of a\\r\\njudgment, or of a proposition which we understand. to begin with\\r\\njudgments: a judgment, as an occurrence, i take to be a relation of a\\r\\nmind to several entities, namely, the entities which compose what is\\r\\njudged. if, e.g. i judge that a loves b, the judgment as an event\\r\\nconsists in the existence, at a certain moment, of a specific\\r\\nfour-term relation, called _judging_, between me and a and love and b.\\r\\nthat is to say, at the time when i judge, there is a certain complex\\r\\nwhose terms are myself and a and love and b, and whose relating\\r\\nrelation is _judging_. my reasons for this view have been set forth\\r\\nelsewhere,[41] and i shall not repeat them here. assuming this view of\\r\\njudgment, the constituents of the judgment are simply the constituents\\r\\nof the complex which is the judgment. thus, in the above case, the\\r\\nconstituents are myself and a and love and b and judging. but myself\\r\\nand judging are constituents shared by all my judgments; thus the\\r\\n_distinctive_ constituents of the particular judgment in question are\\r\\na and love and b. coming now to what is meant by \"understanding a\\r\\nproposition,\" i should say that there is another relation possible\\r\\nbetween me and a and love and b, which is called my _supposing_ that a\\r\\nloves b.[42] when we can _suppose_ that a loves b, we \"understand the\\r\\nproposition\" _a loves b_. thus we often understand a proposition in\\r\\ncases where we have not enough knowledge to make a judgment.\\r\\nsupposing, like judging, is a many-term relation, of which a mind is\\r\\none term. the other terms of the relation are called the constituents\\r\\nof the proposition supposed. thus the principle which i enunciated may\\r\\nbe re-stated as follows: _whenever a relation of supposing or judging\\r\\noccurs, the terms to which the supposing or judging mind is related by\\r\\nthe relation of supposing or judging must be terms with which the mind\\r\\nin question is acquainted._ this is merely to say that we cannot make\\r\\na judgment or a supposition without knowing what it is that we are\\r\\nmaking our judgment or supposition about. it seems to me that the\\r\\ntruth of this principle is evident as soon as the principle is\\r\\nunderstood; i shall, therefore, in what follows, assume the principle,\\r\\nand use it as a guide in analysing judgments that contain\\r\\ndescriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nreturning now to julius csar, i assume that it will be admitted that\\r\\nhe himself is not a constituent of any judgment which i can make. but\\r\\nat this point it is necessary to examine the view that judgments are\\r\\ncomposed of something called \"ideas,\" and that it is the \"idea\" of\\r\\njulius csar that is a constituent of my judgment. i believe the\\r\\nplausibility of this view rests upon a failure to form a right theory\\r\\nof descriptions. we may mean by my \"idea\" of julius csar the things\\r\\nthat i know about him, e.g. that he conquered gaul, was assassinated\\r\\non the ides of march, and is a plague to schoolboys. now i am\\r\\nadmitting, and indeed contending, that in order to discover what is\\r\\nactually in my mind when i judge about julius csar, we must\\r\\nsubstitute for the proper name a description made up of some of the\\r\\nthings i know about him. (a description which will often serve to\\r\\nexpress my thought is \"the man whose name was _julius csar_.\" for\\r\\nwhatever else i may have forgotten about him, it is plain that when i\\r\\nmention him i have not forgotten that that was his name.) but although\\r\\ni think the theory that judgments consist of ideas may have been\\r\\nsuggested in some such way, yet i think the theory itself is\\r\\nfundamentally mistaken. the view seems to be that there is some\\r\\nmental existent which may be called the \"idea\" of something outside\\r\\nthe mind of the person who has the idea, and that, since judgment is a\\r\\nmental event, its constituents must be constituents of the mind of the\\r\\nperson judging. but in this view ideas become a veil between us and\\r\\noutside things--we never really, in knowledge, attain to the things we\\r\\nare supposed to be knowing about, but only to the ideas of those\\r\\nthings. the relation of mind, idea, and object, on this view, is\\r\\nutterly obscure, and, so far as i can see, nothing discoverable by\\r\\ninspection warrants the intrusion of the idea between the mind and the\\r\\nobject. i suspect that the view is fostered by the dislike of\\r\\nrelations, and that it is felt the mind could not know objects unless\\r\\nthere were something \"in\" the mind which could be called the state of\\r\\nknowing the object. such a view, however, leads at once to a vicious\\r\\nendless regress, since the relation of idea to object will have to be\\r\\nexplained by supposing that the idea itself has an idea of the object,\\r\\nand so on _ad infinitum_. i therefore see no reason to believe that,\\r\\nwhen we are acquainted with an object, there is in us something which\\r\\ncan be called the \"idea\" of the object. on the contrary, i hold that\\r\\nacquaintance is wholly a relation, not demanding any such constituent\\r\\nof the mind as is supposed by advocates of \"ideas.\" this is, of\\r\\ncourse, a large question, and one which would take us far from our\\r\\nsubject if it were adequately discussed. i therefore content myself\\r\\nwith the above indications, and with the corollary that, in judging,\\r\\nthe actual objects concerning which we judge, rather than any supposed\\r\\npurely mental entities, are constituents of the complex which is the\\r\\njudgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen, therefore, i say that we must substitute for \"julius csar\" some\\r\\ndescription of julius csar, in order to discover the meaning of a\\r\\njudgment nominally about him, i am not saying that we must substitute\\r\\nan idea. suppose our description is \"the man whose name was _julius\\r\\ncsar_.\" let our judgment be \"julius csar was assassinated.\" then it\\r\\nbecomes \"the man whose name was _julius csar_ was assassinated.\" here\\r\\n_julius csar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted, and\\r\\nall the other constituents of the judgment (neglecting the tense in\\r\\n\"was\") are _concepts_ with which we are acquainted. thus our judgment\\r\\nis wholly reduced to constituents with which we are acquainted, but\\r\\njulius csar himself has ceased to be a constituent of our judgment.\\r\\nthis, however, requires a proviso, to be further explained shortly,\\r\\nnamely that \"the man whose name was _julius csar_\" must not, as a\\r\\nwhole, be a constituent of our judgment, that is to say, this phrase\\r\\nmust not, as a whole, have a meaning which enters into the judgment.\\r\\nany right analysis of the judgment, therefore, must break up this\\r\\nphrase, and not treat it as a subordinate complex which is part of the\\r\\njudgment. the judgment \"the man whose name was _julius csar_ was\\r\\nassassinated\" may be interpreted as meaning \"one and only one man was\\r\\ncalled _julius csar_, and that one was assassinated.\" here it is\\r\\nplain that there is no constituent corresponding to the phrase \"the\\r\\nman whose name was _julius csar_.\" thus there is no reason to regard\\r\\nthis phrase as expressing a constituent of the judgment, and we have\\r\\nseen that this phrase must be broken up if we are to be acquainted\\r\\nwith all the constituents of the judgment. this conclusion, which we\\r\\nhave reached from considerations concerned with the theory of\\r\\nknowledge, is also forced upon us by logical considerations, which\\r\\nmust now be briefly reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is common to distinguish two aspects, _meaning_ and _denotation_,\\r\\nsuch phrases as \"the author of waverley.\" the meaning will be a\\r\\ncertain complex, consisting (at least) of authorship and waverley with\\r\\nsome relation; the denotation will be scott. similarly \"featherless\\r\\nbipeds\" will have a complex meaning, containing as constituents the\\r\\npresence of two feet and the absence of feathers, while its denotation\\r\\nwill be the class of men. thus when we say \"scott is the author of\\r\\nwaverley\" or \"men are the same as featherless bipeds,\" we are\\r\\nasserting an identity of denotation, and this assertion is worth\\r\\nmaking because of the diversity of meaning.[43] i believe that the\\r\\nduality of meaning and denotation, though capable of a true\\r\\ninterpretation, is misleading if taken as fundamental. the denotation,\\r\\ni believe, is not a constituent of the proposition, except in the case\\r\\nof proper names, i.e. of words which do not assign a property to an\\r\\nobject, but merely and solely name it. and i should hold further that,\\r\\nin this sense, there are only two words which are strictly proper\\r\\nnames of particulars, namely, \"i\" and \"this.\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\none reason for not believing the denotation to be a constituent of the\\r\\nproposition is that we may know the proposition even when we are not\\r\\nacquainted with the denotation. the proposition \"the author of\\r\\nwaverley is a novelist\" was known to people who did not know that \"the\\r\\nauthor of waverley\" denoted scott. this reason has been already\\r\\nsufficiently emphasised.\\r\\n\\r\\na second reason is that propositions concerning \"the so-and-so\" are\\r\\npossible even when \"the so-and-so\" has no denotation. take, e.g. \"the\\r\\ngolden mountain does not exist\" or \"the round square is\\r\\nself-contradictory.\" if we are to preserve the duality of meaning and\\r\\ndenotation, we have to say, with meinong, that there are such objects\\r\\nas the golden mountain and the round square, although these objects do\\r\\nnot have being. we even have to admit that the existent round square\\r\\nis existent, but does not exist.[45] meinong does not regard this as a\\r\\ncontradiction, but i fail to see that it is not one. indeed, it seems\\r\\nto me evident that the judgment \"there is no such object as the round\\r\\nsquare\" does not presuppose that there is such an object. if this is\\r\\nadmitted, however, we are led to the conclusion that, by parity of\\r\\nform, no judgment concerning \"the so-and-so\" actually involves the\\r\\nso-and-so as a constituent.\\r\\n\\r\\nmiss jones[46] contends that there is no difficulty in admitting\\r\\ncontradictory predicates concerning such an object as \"the present\\r\\nking of france,\" on the ground that this object is in itself\\r\\ncontradictory. now it might, of course, be argued that this object,\\r\\nunlike the round square, is not self-contradictory, but merely\\r\\nnon-existent. this, however, would not go to the root of the matter.\\r\\nthe real objection to such an argument is that the law of\\r\\ncontradiction ought not to be stated in the traditional form \"a is not\\r\\nboth b and not b,\" but in the form \"no proposition is both true and\\r\\nfalse.\" the traditional form only applies to certain propositions,\\r\\nnamely, to those which attribute a predicate to a subject. when the\\r\\nlaw is stated of propositions, instead of being stated concerning\\r\\nsubjects and predicates, it is at once evident that propositions about\\r\\nthe present king of france or the round square can form no exception,\\r\\nbut are just as incapable of being both true and false as other\\r\\npropositions. miss jones[47] argues that \"scott is the author of\\r\\nwaverley\" asserts identity of denotation between _scott_ and _the\\r\\nauthor of waverley_. but there is some difficulty in choosing among\\r\\nalternative meanings of this contention. in the first place, it should\\r\\nbe observed that _the author of waverley_ is not a _mere_ name, like\\r\\n_scott_. _scott_ is merely a noise or shape conventionally used to\\r\\ndesignate a certain person; it gives us no information about that\\r\\nperson, and has nothing that can be called meaning as opposed to\\r\\ndenotation. (i neglect the fact, considered above, that even proper\\r\\nnames, as a rule, really stand for descriptions.) but _the author of\\r\\nwaverley_ is not merely conventionally a name for scott; the element\\r\\nof mere convention belongs here to the separate words, _the_ and\\r\\n_author_ and _of_ and _waverley_. given what these words stand for,\\r\\n_the author of waverley_ is no longer arbitrary. when it is said that\\r\\nscott is the author of waverley, we are not stating that these are two\\r\\n_names_ for one man, as we should be if we said \"scott is sir walter.\"\\r\\na man\\'s name is what he is called, but however much scott had been\\r\\ncalled the author of waverley, that would not have made him be the\\r\\nauthor; it was necessary for him actually to write waverley, which was\\r\\na fact having nothing to do with names.\\r\\n\\r\\nif, then, we are asserting identity of denotation, we must not mean by\\r\\n_denotation_ the mere relation of a name to the thing named. in fact,\\r\\nit would be nearer to the truth to say that the _meaning_ of \"scott\"\\r\\nis the _denotation_ of \"the author of waverley.\" the relation of\\r\\n\"scott\" to scott is that \"scott\" means scott, just as the relation of\\r\\n\"author\" to the concept which is so called is that \"author\" means this\\r\\nconcept. thus if we distinguish meaning and denotation in \"the author\\r\\nof waverley,\" we shall have to say that \"scott\" has meaning but not\\r\\ndenotation. also when we say \"scott is the author of waverley,\" the\\r\\n_meaning_ of \"the author of waverley\" is relevant to our assertion.\\r\\nfor if the denotation alone were relevant, any other phrase with the\\r\\nsame denotation would give the same proposition. thus \"scott is the\\r\\nauthor of marmion\" would be the same proposition as \"scott is the\\r\\nauthor of waverley.\" but this is plainly not the case, since from the\\r\\nfirst we learn that scott wrote marmion and from the second we learn\\r\\nthat he wrote waverley, but the first tells us nothing about waverley\\r\\nand the second nothing about marmion. hence the meaning of \"the author\\r\\nof waverley,\" as opposed to the denotation, is certainly relevant to\\r\\n\"scott is the author of waverley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have thus agreed that \"the author of waverley\" is not a mere name,\\r\\nand that its meaning is relevant in propositions in which it occurs.\\r\\nthus if we are to say, as miss jones does, that \"scott is the author\\r\\nof waverley\" asserts an identity of denotation, we must regard the\\r\\ndenotation of \"the author of waverley\" as the denotation of what is\\r\\n_meant_ by \"the author of waverley.\" let us call the meaning of \"the\\r\\nauthor of waverley\" m. thus m is what \"the author of waverley\" means.\\r\\nthen we are to suppose that \"scott is the author of waverley\" means\\r\\n\"scott is the denotation of m.\" but here we are explaining our\\r\\nproposition by another of the same form, and thus we have made no\\r\\nprogress towards a real explanation. \"the denotation of m,\" like \"the\\r\\nauthor of waverley,\" has both meaning and denotation, on the theory we\\r\\nare examining. if we call its meaning m\\', our proposition becomes\\r\\n\"scott is the denotation of m\\'.\" but this leads at once to an endless\\r\\nregress. thus the attempt to regard our proposition as asserting\\r\\nidentity of denotation breaks down, and it becomes imperative to find\\r\\nsome other analysis. when this analysis has been completed, we shall\\r\\nbe able to reinterpret the phrase \"identity of denotation,\" which\\r\\nremains obscure so long as it is taken as fundamental.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first point to observe is that, in any proposition about \"the\\r\\nauthor of waverley,\" provided scott is not explicitly mentioned, the\\r\\ndenotation itself, i.e. scott, does not occur, but only the concept of\\r\\ndenotation, which will be represented by a variable. suppose we say\\r\\n\"the author of waverley was the author of marmion,\" we are certainly\\r\\nnot saying that both were scott--we may have forgotten that there was\\r\\nsuch a person as scott. we are saying that there is some man who was\\r\\nthe author of waverley and the author of marmion. that is to say,\\r\\nthere is some one who wrote waverley and marmion, and no one else\\r\\nwrote them. thus the identity is that of a variable, i.e. of an\\r\\nindefinite subject, \"some one.\" this is why we can understand\\r\\npropositions about \"the author of waverley,\" without knowing who he\\r\\nwas. when we say \"the author of waverley was a poet,\" we mean \"one and\\r\\nonly one man wrote waverley, and he was a poet\"; when we say \"the\\r\\nauthor of waverley was scott\" we mean \"one and only one man wrote\\r\\nwaverley, and he was scott.\" here the identity is between a variable,\\r\\ni.e. an indeterminate subject (\"he\"), and scott; \"the author of\\r\\nwaverley\" has been analysed away, and no longer appears as a\\r\\nconstituent of the proposition.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nthe reason why it is imperative to analyse away the phrase \"the author\\r\\nof waverley\" may be stated as follows. it is plain that when we say\\r\\n\"the author of waverley is the author of marmion,\" the _is_ expresses\\r\\nidentity. we have seen also that the common _denotation_, namely\\r\\nscott, is not a constituent of this proposition, while the _meanings_\\r\\n(if any) of \"the author of waverley\" and \"the author of marmion\" are\\r\\nnot identical. we have seen also that, in any sense in which the\\r\\nmeaning of a word is a constituent of a proposition in whose verbal\\r\\nexpression the word occurs, \"scott\" means the actual man scott, in the\\r\\nsame sense (so far as concerns our present discussion) in which\\r\\n\"author\" means a certain universal. thus, if \"the author of waverley\"\\r\\nwere a subordinate complex in the above proposition, its _meaning_\\r\\nwould have to be what was said to be identical with the _meaning_ of\\r\\n\"the author of marmion.\" this is plainly not the case; and the only\\r\\nescape is to say that \"the author of waverley\" does not, by itself,\\r\\nhave a meaning, though phrases of which it is part do have a meaning.\\r\\nthat is, in a right analysis of the above proposition, \"the author of\\r\\nwaverley\" must disappear. this is effected when the above proposition\\r\\nis analysed as meaning: \"some one wrote waverley and no one else did,\\r\\nand that some one also wrote marmion and no one else did.\" this may be\\r\\nmore simply expressed by saying that the propositional function \"_x_\\r\\nwrote waverley and marmion, and no one else did\" is capable of truth,\\r\\ni.e. some value of _x_ makes it true, but no other value does. thus\\r\\nthe true subject of our judgment is a propositional function, i.e. a\\r\\ncomplex containing an undetermined constituent, and becoming a\\r\\nproposition as soon as this constituent is determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now define the denotation of a phrase. if we know that the\\r\\nproposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so\" is true, i.e. that _a_ is so-and-so\\r\\nand nothing else is, we call _a_ the denotation of the phrase \"the\\r\\nso-and-so.\" a very great many of the propositions we naturally make\\r\\nabout \"the so-and-so\" will remain true or remain false if we\\r\\nsubstitute _a_ for \"the so-and-so,\" where _a_ is the denotation of\\r\\n\"the so-and-so.\" such propositions will also remain true or remain\\r\\nfalse if we substitute for \"the so-and-so\" any other phrase having the\\r\\nsame denotation. hence, as practical men, we become interested in the\\r\\ndenotation more than in the description, since the denotation decides\\r\\nas to the truth or falsehood of so many statements in which the\\r\\ndescription occurs. moreover, as we saw earlier in considering the\\r\\nrelations of description and acquaintance, we often wish to reach the\\r\\ndenotation, and are only hindered by lack of acquaintance: in such\\r\\ncases the description is merely the means we employ to get as near as\\r\\npossible to the denotation. hence it naturally comes to be supposed\\r\\nthat the denotation is part of the proposition in which the\\r\\ndescription occurs. but we have seen, both on logical and on\\r\\nepistemological grounds, that this is an error. the actual object (if\\r\\nany) which is the denotation is not (unless it is explicitly\\r\\nmentioned) a constituent of propositions in which descriptions occur;\\r\\nand this is the reason why, in order to understand such propositions,\\r\\nwe need acquaintance with the constituents of the description, but do\\r\\nnot need acquaintance with its denotation. the first result of\\r\\nanalysis, when applied to propositions whose grammatical subject is\\r\\n\"the so-and-so,\" is to substitute a variable as subject; i.e. we\\r\\nobtain a proposition of the form: \"there is _something_ which alone is\\r\\nso-and-so, and that _something_ is such-and-such.\" the further\\r\\nanalysis of propositions concerning \"the so-and-so\" is thus merged in\\r\\nthe problem of the nature of the variable, i.e. of the meanings of\\r\\n_some_, _any_, and _all_. this is a difficult problem, concerning\\r\\nwhich i do not intend to say anything at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nto sum up our whole discussion. we began by distinguishing two sorts\\r\\nof knowledge of objects, namely, knowledge by _acquaintance_ and\\r\\nknowledge by _description_. of these it is only the former that brings\\r\\nthe object itself before the mind. we have acquaintance with\\r\\nsense-data, with many universals, and possibly with ourselves, but not\\r\\nwith physical objects or other minds. we have _descriptive_ knowledge\\r\\nof an object when we know that it is _the_ object having some property\\r\\nor properties with which we are acquainted; that is to say, when we\\r\\nknow that the property or properties in question belong to one object\\r\\nand no more, we are said to have knowledge of that one object by\\r\\ndescription, whether or not we are acquainted with the object. our\\r\\nknowledge of physical objects and of other minds is only knowledge by\\r\\ndescription, the descriptions involved being usually such as involve\\r\\nsense-data. all propositions intelligible to us, whether or not they\\r\\nprimarily concern things only known to us by description, are composed\\r\\nwholly of constituents with which we are acquainted, for a constituent\\r\\nwith which we are not acquainted is unintelligible to us. a judgment,\\r\\nwe found, is not composed of mental constituents called \"ideas,\" but\\r\\nconsists of an occurrence whose constituents are a mind[49] and\\r\\ncertain objects, particulars or universals. (one at least must be a\\r\\nuniversal.) when a judgment is rightly analysed, the objects which are\\r\\nconstituents of it must all be objects with which the mind which is a\\r\\nconstituent of it is acquainted. this conclusion forces us to analyse\\r\\ndescriptive phrases occurring in propositions, and to say that the\\r\\nobjects denoted by such phrases are not constituents of judgments in\\r\\nwhich such phrases occur (unless these objects are explicitly\\r\\nmentioned). this leads us to the view (recommended also on purely\\r\\nlogical grounds) that when we say \"the author of marmion was the\\r\\nauthor of waverley,\" scott himself is not a constituent of our\\r\\njudgment, and that the judgment cannot be explained by saying that it\\r\\naffirms identity of denotation with diversity of meaning. it also,\\r\\nplainly, does not assert identity of meaning. such judgments,\\r\\ntherefore, can only be analysed by breaking up the descriptive\\r\\nphrases, introducing a variable, and making propositional functions\\r\\nthe ultimate subjects. in fact, \"the so-and-so is such-and-such\" will\\r\\nmean that \"_x_ is so-and-so and nothing else is, and _x_ is\\r\\nsuch-and-such\" is capable of truth. the analysis of such judgments\\r\\ninvolves many fresh problems, but the discussion of these problems is\\r\\nnot undertaken in the present paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nfootnotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n[40] see references later.\\r\\n\\r\\n[41] _philosophical essays_, \"the nature of truth.\" i have been\\r\\npersuaded by mr. wittgenstein that this theory is somewhat unduly\\r\\nsimple, but the modification which i believe it to require does not\\r\\naffect the above argument [1917].\\r\\n\\r\\n[42] cf. meinong, _ueber annahmen_, _passim_. i formerly supposed,\\r\\ncontrary to meinong\\'s view, that the relationship of supposing might\\r\\nbe merely that of presentation. in this view i now think i was\\r\\nmistaken, and meinong is right. but my present view depends upon the\\r\\ntheory that both in judgment and in assumption there is no single\\r\\nobjective, but the several constituents of the judgment or assumption\\r\\nare in a many-term relation to the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n[43] this view has been recently advocated by miss e.e.c. jones. \"a\\r\\nnew law of thought and its implications,\" _mind_, january, 1911.\\r\\n\\r\\n[44] i should now exclude \"i\" from proper names in the strict sense,\\r\\nand retain only \"this\" [1917].\\r\\n\\r\\n[45] meinong, _ueber annahmen_, 2nd ed., leipzig, 1910, p. 141.\\r\\n\\r\\n[46] _mind_, july,

without intending to prejudge the question\\r\\nas to what this something is.  our knowledge of the\\r\\n  external world\\r\\n\\r\\n  as a field for scientific method\\r\\n  in philosophy\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture i\\r\\n\\r\\ncurrent tendencies\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy, from the earliest times, has made greater claims, and\\r\\nachieved fewer results, than any other branch of learning. ever since\\r\\nthales said that all is water, philosophers have been ready with glib\\r\\nassertions about the sum-total of things; and equally glib denials have\\r\\ncome from other philosophers ever since thales was contradicted by\\r\\nanaximander. i believe that the time has now arrived when this\\r\\nunsatisfactory state of things can be brought to an end. in the\\r\\nfollowing course of lectures i shall try, chiefly by taking certain\\r\\nspecial problems as examples, to indicate wherein the claims of\\r\\nphilosophers have been excessive, and why their achievements have not\\r\\nbeen greater. the problems and the method of philosophy have, i believe,\\r\\nbeen misconceived by all schools, many of its traditional problems being\\r\\ninsoluble with our means of knowledge, while other more neglected but\\r\\nnot less important problems can, by a more patient and more adequate\\r\\nmethod, be solved with all the precision and certainty to which the most\\r\\nadvanced sciences have attained.\\r\\n\\r\\namong present-day philosophies, we may distinguish three principal\\r\\ntypes, often combined in varying proportions by a single philosopher,\\r\\nbut in essence and tendency distinct. the first of these, which i shall\\r\\ncall the classical tradition, descends in the main from kant and hegel;\\r\\nit represents the attempt to adapt to present needs the methods and\\r\\nresults of the great constructive philosophers from plato downwards. the\\r\\nsecond type, which may be called evolutionism, derived its predominance\\r\\nfrom darwin, and must be reckoned as having had herbert spencer for its\\r\\nfirst philosophical representative; but in recent times it has become,\\r\\nchiefly through william james and m. bergson, far bolder and far more\\r\\nsearching in its innovations than it was in the hands of herbert\\r\\nspencer. the third type, which may be called \"logical atomism\" for want\\r\\nof a better name, has gradually crept into philosophy through the\\r\\ncritical scrutiny of mathematics. this type of philosophy, which is the\\r\\none that i wish to advocate, has not as yet many whole-hearted\\r\\nadherents, but the \"new realism\" which owes its inception to harvard is\\r\\nvery largely impregnated with its spirit. it represents, i believe, the\\r\\nsame kind of advance as was introduced into physics by galileo: the\\r\\nsubstitution of piecemeal, detailed, and verifiable results for large\\r\\nuntested generalities recommended only by a certain appeal to\\r\\nimagination. but before we can understand the changes advocated by this\\r\\nnew philosophy, we must briefly examine and criticise the other two\\r\\ntypes with which it has to contend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na. the classical tradition\\r\\n\\r\\ntwenty years ago, the classical tradition, having vanquished the\\r\\nopposing tradition of the english empiricists, held almost unquestioned\\r\\nsway in all anglo-saxon universities. at the present day, though it is\\r\\nlosing ground, many of the most prominent teachers still adhere to it.\\r\\nin academic france, in spite of m. bergson, it is far stronger than all\\r\\nits opponents combined; and in germany it has many vigorous advocates.\\r\\nnevertheless, it represents on the whole a decaying force, and it has\\r\\nfailed to adapt itself to the temper of the age. its advocates are, in\\r\\nthe main, those whose extra-philosophical knowledge is literary, rather\\r\\nthan those who have felt the inspiration of science. there are, apart\\r\\nfrom reasoned arguments, certain general intellectual forces against\\r\\nit--the same general forces which are breaking down the other great\\r\\nsyntheses of the past, and making our age one of bewildered groping\\r\\nwhere our ancestors walked in the clear daylight of unquestioning\\r\\ncertainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe original impulse out of which the classical tradition developed was\\r\\nthe naive faith of the greek philosophers in the omnipotence of\\r\\nreasoning. the discovery of geometry had intoxicated them, and its _a\\r\\npriori_ deductive method appeared capable of universal application. they\\r\\nwould prove, for instance, that all reality is one, that there is no\\r\\nsuch thing as change, that the world of sense is a world of mere\\r\\nillusion; and the strangeness of their results gave them no qualms\\r\\nbecause they believed in the correctness of their reasoning. thus it\\r\\ncame to be thought that by mere thinking the most surprising and\\r\\nimportant truths concerning the whole of reality could be established\\r\\nwith a certainty which no contrary observations could shake. as the\\r\\nvital impulse of the early philosophers died away, its place was taken\\r\\nby authority and tradition, reinforced, in the middle ages and almost to\\r\\nour own day, by systematic theology. modern philosophy, from descartes\\r\\nonwards, though not bound by authority like that of the middle ages,\\r\\nstill accepted more or less uncritically the aristotelian logic.\\r\\nmoreover, it still believed, except in great britain, that _a priori_\\r\\nreasoning could reveal otherwise undiscoverable secrets about the\\r\\nuniverse, and could prove reality to be quite different from what, to\\r\\ndirect observation, it appears to be. it is this belief, rather than any\\r\\nparticular tenets resulting from it, that i regard as the distinguishing\\r\\ncharacteristic of the classical tradition, and as hitherto the main\\r\\nobstacle to a scientific attitude in philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe nature of the philosophy embodied in the classical tradition may be\\r\\nmade clearer by taking a particular exponent as an illustration. for\\r\\nthis purpose, let us consider for a moment the doctrines of mr bradley,\\r\\nwho is probably the most distinguished living representative of this\\r\\nschool. mr bradley\\'s _appearance and reality_ is a book consisting of\\r\\ntwo parts, the first called _appearance_, the second _reality_. the\\r\\nfirst part examines and condemns almost all that makes up our everyday\\r\\nworld: things and qualities, relations, space and time, change,\\r\\ncausation, activity, the self. all these, though in some sense facts\\r\\nwhich qualify reality, are not real as they appear. what is real is one\\r\\nsingle, indivisible, timeless whole, called the absolute, which is in\\r\\nsome sense spiritual, but does not consist of souls, or of thought and\\r\\nwill as we know them. and all this is established by abstract logical\\r\\nreasoning professing to find self-contradictions in the categories\\r\\ncondemned as mere appearance, and to leave no tenable alternative to the\\r\\nkind of absolute which is finally affirmed to be real.\\r\\n\\r\\none brief example may suffice to illustrate mr bradley\\'s method. the\\r\\nworld appears to be full of many things with various relations to each\\r\\nother--right and left, before and after, father and son, and so on. but\\r\\nrelations, according to mr bradley, are found on examination to be\\r\\nself-contradictory and therefore impossible. he first argues that, if\\r\\nthere are relations, there must be qualities between which they hold.\\r\\nthis part of his argument need not detain us. he then proceeds:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"but how the relation can stand to the qualities is, on the other side,\\r\\nunintelligible. if it is nothing to the qualities, then they are not\\r\\nrelated at all; and, if so, as we saw, they have ceased to be qualities,\\r\\nand their relation is a nonentity. but if it is to be something to them,\\r\\nthen clearly we shall require a _new_ connecting relation. for the\\r\\nrelation hardly can be the mere adjective of one or both of its terms;\\r\\nor, at least, as such it seems indefensible. and, being something\\r\\nitself, if it does not itself bear a relation to the terms, in what\\r\\nintelligible way will it succeed in being anything to them? but here\\r\\nagain we are hurried off into the eddy of a hopeless process, since we\\r\\nare forced to go on finding new relations without end. the links are\\r\\nunited by a link, and this bond of union is a link which also has two\\r\\nends; and these require each a fresh link to connect them with the old.\\r\\nthe problem is to find how the relation can stand to its qualities, and\\r\\nthis problem is insoluble.\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [4] _appearance and reality_, pp. 32-33.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not propose to examine this argument in detail, or to show the\\r\\nexact points where, in my opinion, it is fallacious. i have quoted it\\r\\nonly as an example of method. most people will admit, i think, that it\\r\\nis calculated to produce bewilderment rather than conviction, because\\r\\nthere is more likelihood of error in a very subtle, abstract, and\\r\\ndifficult argument than in so patent a fact as the interrelatedness of\\r\\nthe things in the world. to the early greeks, to whom geometry was\\r\\npractically the only known science, it was possible to follow reasoning\\r\\nwith assent even when it led to the strangest conclusions. but to us,\\r\\nwith our methods of experiment and observation, our knowledge of the\\r\\nlong history of _a priori_ errors refuted by empirical science, it has\\r\\nbecome natural to suspect a fallacy in any deduction of which the\\r\\nconclusion appears to contradict patent facts. it is easy to carry such\\r\\nsuspicion too far, and it is very desirable, if possible, actually to\\r\\ndiscover the exact nature of the error when it exists. but there is no\\r\\ndoubt that what we may call the empirical outlook has become part of\\r\\nmost educated people\\'s habit of mind; and it is this, rather than any\\r\\ndefinite argument, that has diminished the hold of the classical\\r\\ntradition upon students of philosophy and the instructed public\\r\\ngenerally.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe function of logic in philosophy, as i shall try to show at a later\\r\\nstage, is all-important; but i do not think its function is that which\\r\\nit has in the classical tradition. in that tradition, logic becomes\\r\\nconstructive through negation. where a number of alternatives seem, at\\r\\nfirst sight, to be equally possible, logic is made to condemn all of\\r\\nthem except one, and that one is then pronounced to be realised in the\\r\\nactual world. thus the world is constructed by means of logic, with\\r\\nlittle or no appeal to concrete experience. the true function of logic\\r\\nis, in my opinion, exactly the opposite of this. as applied to matters\\r\\nof experience, it is analytic rather than constructive; taken _a\\r\\npriori_, it shows the possibility of hitherto unsuspected alternatives\\r\\nmore often than the impossibility of alternatives which seemed _prima\\r\\nfacie_ possible. thus, while it liberates imagination as to what the\\r\\nworld _may_ be, it refuses to legislate as to what the world _is_. this\\r\\nchange, which has been brought about by an internal revolution in logic,\\r\\nhas swept away the ambitious constructions of traditional metaphysics,\\r\\neven for those whose faith in logic is greatest; while to the many who\\r\\nregard logic as a chimera the paradoxical systems to which it has given\\r\\nrise do not seem worthy even of refutation. thus on all sides these\\r\\nsystems have ceased to attract, and even the philosophical world tends\\r\\nmore and more to pass them by.\\r\\n\\r\\none or two of the favourite doctrines of the school we are considering\\r\\nmay be mentioned to illustrate the nature of its claims. the universe,\\r\\nit tells us, is an \"organic unity,\" like an animal or a perfect work of\\r\\nart. by this it means, roughly speaking, that all the different parts\\r\\nfit together and co-operate, and are what they are because of their\\r\\nplace in the whole. this belief is sometimes advanced dogmatically,\\r\\nwhile at other times it is defended by certain logical arguments. if it\\r\\nis true, every part of the universe is a microcosm, a miniature\\r\\nreflection of the whole. if we knew ourselves thoroughly, according to\\r\\nthis doctrine, we should know everything. common sense would naturally\\r\\nobject that there are people--say in china--with whom our relations are\\r\\nso indirect and trivial that we cannot infer anything important as to\\r\\nthem from any fact about ourselves. if there are living beings in mars\\r\\nor in more distant parts of the universe, the same argument becomes even\\r\\nstronger. but further, perhaps the whole contents of the space and time\\r\\nin which we live form only one of many universes, each seeming to itself\\r\\ncomplete. and thus the conception of the necessary unity of all that is\\r\\nresolves itself into the poverty of imagination, and a freer logic\\r\\nemancipates us from the strait-waistcoated benevolent institution which\\r\\nidealism palms off as the totality of being.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother very important doctrine held by most, though not all, of the\\r\\nschool we are examining is the doctrine that all reality is what is\\r\\ncalled \"mental\" or \"spiritual,\" or that, at any rate, all reality is\\r\\ndependent for its existence upon what is mental. this view is often\\r\\nparticularised into the form which states that the relation of knower\\r\\nand known is fundamental, and that nothing can exist unless it either\\r\\nknows or is known. here again the same legislative function is ascribed\\r\\nto _a priori_ argumentation: it is thought that there are contradictions\\r\\nin an unknown reality. again, if i am not mistaken, the argument is\\r\\nfallacious, and a better logic will show that no limits can be set to\\r\\nthe extent and nature of the unknown. and when i speak of the unknown, i\\r\\ndo not mean merely what we personally do not know, but what is not known\\r\\nto any mind. here as elsewhere, while the older logic shut out\\r\\npossibilities and imprisoned imagination within the walls of the\\r\\nfamiliar, the newer logic shows rather what may happen, and refuses to\\r\\ndecide as to what _must_ happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe classical tradition in philosophy is the last surviving child of two\\r\\nvery diverse parents: the greek belief in reason, and the mediaeval\\r\\nbelief in the tidiness of the universe. to the schoolmen, who lived amid\\r\\nwars, massacres, and pestilences, nothing appeared so delightful as\\r\\nsafety and order. in their idealising dreams, it was safety and order\\r\\nthat they sought: the universe of thomas aquinas or dante is as small\\r\\nand neat as a dutch interior. to us, to whom safety has become monotony,\\r\\nto whom the primeval savageries of nature are so remote as to become a\\r\\nmere pleasing condiment to our ordered routine, the world of dreams is\\r\\nvery different from what it was amid the wars of guelf and ghibelline.\\r\\nhence william james\\'s protest against what he calls the \"block universe\"\\r\\nof the classical tradition; hence nietzsche\\'s worship of force; hence\\r\\nthe verbal bloodthirstiness of many quiet literary men. the barbaric\\r\\nsubstratum of human nature, unsatisfied in action, finds an outlet in\\r\\nimagination. in philosophy, as elsewhere, this tendency is visible; and\\r\\nit is this, rather than formal argument, that has thrust aside the\\r\\nclassical tradition for a philosophy which fancies itself more virile\\r\\nand more vital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb. evolutionism\\r\\n\\r\\nevolutionism, in one form or another, is the prevailing creed of our\\r\\ntime. it dominates our politics, our literature, and not least our\\r\\nphilosophy. nietzsche, pragmatism, bergson, are phases in its\\r\\nphilosophic development, and their popularity far beyond the circles of\\r\\nprofessional philosophers shows its consonance with the spirit of the\\r\\nage. it believes itself firmly based on science, a liberator of hopes,\\r\\nan inspirer of an invigorating faith in human power, a sure antidote to\\r\\nthe ratiocinative authority of the greeks and the dogmatic authority of\\r\\nmediaeval systems. against so fashionable and so agreeable a creed it may\\r\\nseem useless to raise a protest; and with much of its spirit every\\r\\nmodern man must be in sympathy. but i think that, in the intoxication of\\r\\na quick success, much that is important and vital to a true\\r\\nunderstanding of the universe has been forgotten. something of hellenism\\r\\nmust be combined with the new spirit before it can emerge from the\\r\\nardour of youth into the wisdom of manhood. and it is time to remember\\r\\nthat biology is neither the only science, nor yet the model to which all\\r\\nother sciences must adapt themselves. evolutionism, as i shall try to\\r\\nshow, is not a truly scientific philosophy, either in its method or in\\r\\nthe problems which it considers. the true scientific philosophy is\\r\\nsomething more arduous and more aloof, appealing to less mundane hopes,\\r\\nand requiring a severer discipline for its successful practice.\\r\\n\\r\\ndarwin\\'s _origin of species_ persuaded the world that the difference\\r\\nbetween different species of animals and plants is not the fixed,\\r\\nimmutable difference that it appears to be. the doctrine of natural\\r\\nkinds, which had rendered classification easy and definite, which was\\r\\nenshrined in the aristotelian tradition, and protected by its supposed\\r\\nnecessity for orthodox dogma, was suddenly swept away for ever out of\\r\\nthe biological world. the difference between man and the lower animals,\\r\\nwhich to our human conceit appears enormous, was shown to be a gradual\\r\\nachievement, involving intermediate beings who could not with certainty\\r\\nbe placed either within or without the human family. the sun and planets\\r\\nhad already been shown by laplace to be very probably derived from a\\r\\nprimitive more or less undifferentiated nebula. thus the old fixed\\r\\nlandmarks became wavering and indistinct, and all sharp outlines were\\r\\nblurred. things and species lost their boundaries, and none could say\\r\\nwhere they began or where they ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut if human conceit was staggered for a moment by its kinship with the\\r\\nape, it soon found a way to reassert itself, and that way is the\\r\\n\"philosophy\" of evolution. a process which led from the amoeba to man\\r\\nappeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress--though whether\\r\\nthe amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known. hence the cycle\\r\\nof changes which science had shown to be the probable history of the\\r\\npast was welcomed as revealing a law of development towards good in the\\r\\nuniverse--an evolution or unfolding of an ideal slowly embodying itself\\r\\nin the actual. but such a view, though it might satisfy spencer and\\r\\nthose whom we may call hegelian evolutionists, could not be accepted as\\r\\nadequate by the more whole-hearted votaries of change. an ideal to which\\r\\nthe world continuously approaches is, to these minds, too dead and\\r\\nstatic to be inspiring. not only the aspirations, but the ideal too,\\r\\nmust change and develop with the course of evolution; there must be no\\r\\nfixed goal, but a continual fashioning of fresh needs by the impulse\\r\\nwhich is life and which alone gives unity to the process.\\r\\n\\r\\never since the seventeenth century, those whom william james described\\r\\nas the \"tender-minded\" have been engaged in a desperate struggle with\\r\\nthe mechanical view of the course of nature which physical science seems\\r\\nto impose. a great part of the attractiveness of the classical tradition\\r\\nwas due to the partial escape from mechanism which it provided. but now,\\r\\nwith the influence of biology, the \"tender-minded\" believe that a more\\r\\nradical escape is possible, sweeping aside not merely the laws of\\r\\nphysics, but the whole apparently immutable apparatus of logic, with its\\r\\nfixed concepts, its general principles, and its reasonings which seem\\r\\nable to compel even the most unwilling assent. the older kind of\\r\\nteleology, therefore, which regarded the end as a fixed goal, already\\r\\npartially visible, towards which we were gradually approaching, is\\r\\nrejected by m. bergson as not allowing enough for the absolute dominion\\r\\nof change. after explaining why he does not accept mechanism, he\\r\\nproceeds:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"but radical finalism is quite as unacceptable, and for the same reason.\\r\\nthe doctrine of teleology, in its extreme form, as we find it in leibniz\\r\\nfor example, implies that things and beings merely realise a programme\\r\\npreviously arranged. but if there is nothing unforeseen, no invention or\\r\\ncreation in the universe, time is useless again. as in the mechanistic\\r\\nhypothesis, here again it is supposed that _all is given_. finalism thus\\r\\nunderstood is only inverted mechanism. it springs from the same\\r\\npostulate, with this sole difference, that in the movement of our finite\\r\\nintellects along successive things, whose successiveness is reduced to a\\r\\nmere appearance, it holds in front of us the light with which it claims\\r\\nto guide us, instead of putting it behind. it substitutes the attraction\\r\\nof the future for the impulsion of the past. but succession remains none\\r\\nthe less a mere appearance, as indeed does movement itself. in the\\r\\ndoctrine of leibniz, time is reduced to a confused perception, relative\\r\\nto the human standpoint, a perception which would vanish, like a rising\\r\\nmist, for a mind seated at the centre of things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"yet finalism is not, like mechanism, a doctrine with fixed rigid\\r\\noutlines. it admits of as many inflections as we like. the mechanistic\\r\\nphilosophy is to be taken or left: it must be left if the least grain of\\r\\ndust, by straying from the path foreseen by mechanics, should show the\\r\\nslightest trace of spontaneity. the doctrine of final causes, on the\\r\\ncontrary, will never be definitively refuted. if one form of it be put\\r\\naside, it will take another. its principle, which is essentially\\r\\npsychological, is very flexible. it is so extensible, and thereby so\\r\\ncomprehensive, that one accepts something of it as soon as one rejects\\r\\npure mechanism. the theory we shall put forward in this book will\\r\\ntherefore necessarily partake of finalism to a certain extent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [5] _creative evolution_, english translation, p. 41.\\r\\n\\r\\nm. bergson\\'s form of finalism depends upon his conception of life. life,\\r\\nin his philosophy, is a continuous stream, in which all divisions are\\r\\nartificial and unreal. separate things, beginnings and endings, are mere\\r\\nconvenient fictions: there is only smooth, unbroken transition. the\\r\\nbeliefs of to-day may count as true to-day, if they carry us along the\\r\\nstream; but to-morrow they will be false, and must be replaced by new\\r\\nbeliefs to meet the new situation. all our thinking consists of\\r\\nconvenient fictions, imaginary congealings of the stream: reality flows\\r\\non in spite of all our fictions, and though it can be lived, it cannot\\r\\nbe conceived in thought. somehow, without explicit statement, the\\r\\nassurance is slipped in that the future, though we cannot foresee it,\\r\\nwill be better than the past or the present: the reader is like the\\r\\nchild who expects a sweet because it has been told to open its mouth and\\r\\nshut its eyes. logic, mathematics, physics disappear in this philosophy,\\r\\nbecause they are too \"static\"; what is real is an impulse and movement\\r\\ntowards a goal which, like the rainbow, recedes as we advance, and makes\\r\\nevery place different when we reach it from what it appeared to be at a\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow i do not propose at present to enter upon a technical examination of\\r\\nthis philosophy. at present i wish to make only two criticisms of\\r\\nit--first, that its truth does not follow from what science has rendered\\r\\nprobable concerning the facts of evolution, and secondly, that the\\r\\nmotives and interests which inspire it are so exclusively practical, and\\r\\nthe problems with which it deals are so special, that it can hardly be\\r\\nregarded as really touching any of the questions that to my mind\\r\\nconstitute genuine philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) what biology has rendered probable is that the diverse species arose\\r\\nby adaptation from a less differentiated ancestry. this fact is in\\r\\nitself exceedingly interesting, but it is not the kind of fact from\\r\\nwhich philosophical consequences follow. philosophy is general, and\\r\\ntakes an impartial interest in all that exists. the changes suffered by\\r\\nminute portions of matter on the earth\\'s surface are very important to\\r\\nus as active sentient beings; but to us as philosophers they have no\\r\\ngreater interest than other changes in portions of matter elsewhere. and\\r\\nif the changes on the earth\\'s surface during the last few millions of\\r\\nyears appear to our present ethical notions to be in the nature of a\\r\\nprogress, that gives no ground for believing that progress is a general\\r\\nlaw of the universe. except under the influence of desire, no one would\\r\\nadmit for a moment so crude a generalisation from such a tiny selection\\r\\nof facts. what does result, not specially from biology, but from all the\\r\\nsciences which deal with what exists, is that we cannot understand the\\r\\nworld unless we can understand change and continuity. this is even more\\r\\nevident in physics than it is in biology. but the analysis of change and\\r\\ncontinuity is not a problem upon which either physics or biology throws\\r\\nany light: it is a problem of a new kind, belonging to a different kind\\r\\nof study. the question whether evolutionism offers a true or a false\\r\\nanswer to this problem is not, therefore, a question to be solved by\\r\\nappeals to particular facts, such as biology and physics reveal. in\\r\\nassuming dogmatically a certain answer to this question, evolutionism\\r\\nceases to be scientific, yet it is only in touching on this question\\r\\nthat evolutionism reaches the subject-matter of philosophy. evolutionism\\r\\nthus consists of two parts: one not philosophical, but only a hasty\\r\\ngeneralisation of the kind which the special sciences might hereafter\\r\\nconfirm or confute; the other not scientific, but a mere unsupported\\r\\ndogma, belonging to philosophy by its subject-matter, but in no way\\r\\ndeducible from the facts upon which evolution relies.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the predominant interest of evolutionism is in the question of human\\r\\ndestiny, or at least of the destiny of life. it is more interested in\\r\\nmorality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. it must be\\r\\nadmitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and that\\r\\na desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy really can give is\\r\\nvery rare. but if philosophy is to become scientific--and it is our\\r\\nobject to discover how this can be achieved--it is necessary first and\\r\\nforemost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested intellectual\\r\\ncuriosity which characterises the genuine man of science. knowledge\\r\\nconcerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that must be\\r\\nsought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible within certain\\r\\nnarrow limits. it is impossible to say how much the limits may be\\r\\nenlarged with the progress of science. but what is evident is that any\\r\\nproposition about the future belongs by its subject-matter to some\\r\\nparticular science, and is to be ascertained, if at all, by the methods\\r\\nof that science. philosophy is not a short cut to the same kind of\\r\\nresults as those of the other sciences: if it is to be a genuine study,\\r\\nit must have a province of its own, and aim at results which the other\\r\\nsciences can neither prove nor disprove.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe consideration that philosophy, if there is such a study, must\\r\\nconsist of propositions which could not occur in the other sciences, is\\r\\none which has very far-reaching consequences. all the questions which\\r\\nhave what is called a human interest--such, for example, as the question\\r\\nof a future life--belong, at least in theory, to special sciences, and\\r\\nare capable, at least in theory, of being decided by empirical evidence.\\r\\nphilosophers have too often, in the past, permitted themselves to\\r\\npronounce on empirical questions, and found themselves, as a result, in\\r\\ndisastrous conflict with well-attested facts. we must, therefore,\\r\\nrenounce the hope that philosophy can promise satisfaction to our\\r\\nmundane desires. what it can do, when it is purified from all practical\\r\\ntaint, is to help us to understand the general aspects of the world and\\r\\nthe logical analysis of familiar but complex things. through this\\r\\nachievement, by the suggestion of fruitful hypotheses, it may be\\r\\nindirectly useful in other sciences, notably mathematics, physics, and\\r\\npsychology. but a genuinely scientific philosophy cannot hope to appeal\\r\\nto any except those who have the wish to understand, to escape from\\r\\nintellectual bewilderment. it offers, in its own domain, the kind of\\r\\nsatisfaction which the other sciences offer. but it does not offer, or\\r\\nattempt to offer, a solution of the problem of human destiny, or of the\\r\\ndestiny of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nevolutionism, if what has been said is true, is to be regarded as a\\r\\nhasty generalisation from certain rather special facts, accompanied by a\\r\\ndogmatic rejection of all attempts at analysis, and inspired by\\r\\ninterests which are practical rather than theoretical. in spite,\\r\\ntherefore, of its appeal to detailed results in various sciences, it\\r\\ncannot be regarded as any more genuinely scientific than the classical\\r\\ntradition which it has replaced. how philosophy is to be rendered\\r\\nscientific, and what is the true subject-matter of philosophy, i shall\\r\\ntry to show first by examples of certain achieved results, and then more\\r\\ngenerally. we will begin with the problem of the physical conceptions of\\r\\nspace and time and matter, which, as we have seen, are challenged by the\\r\\ncontentions of the evolutionists. that these conceptions stand in need\\r\\nof reconstruction will be admitted, and is indeed increasingly urged by\\r\\nphysicists themselves. it will also be admitted that the reconstruction\\r\\nmust take more account of change and the universal flux than is done in\\r\\nthe older mechanics with its fundamental conception of an indestructible\\r\\nmatter. but i do not think the reconstruction required is on bergsonian\\r\\nlines, nor do i think that his rejection of logic can be anything but\\r\\nharmful. i shall not, however, adopt the method of explicit controversy,\\r\\nbut rather the method of independent inquiry, starting from what, in a\\r\\npre-philosophic stage, appear to be facts, and keeping always as close\\r\\nto these initial data as the requirements of consistency will permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough explicit controversy is almost always fruitless in philosophy,\\r\\nowing to the fact that no two philosophers ever understand one another,\\r\\nyet it seems necessary to say something at the outset in justification\\r\\nof the scientific as against the mystical attitude. metaphysics, from\\r\\nthe first, has been developed by the union or the conflict of these two\\r\\nattitudes. among the earliest greek philosophers, the ionians were more\\r\\nscientific and the sicilians more mystical.[6] but among the latter,\\r\\npythagoras, for example, was in himself a curious mixture of the two\\r\\ntendencies: the scientific attitude led him to his proposition on\\r\\nright-angled triangles, while his mystic insight showed him that it is\\r\\nwicked to eat beans. naturally enough, his followers divided into two\\r\\nsects, the lovers of right-angled triangles and the abhorrers of beans;\\r\\nbut the former sect died out, leaving, however, a haunting flavour of\\r\\nmysticism over much greek mathematical speculation, and in particular\\r\\nover plato\\'s views on mathematics. plato, of course, embodies both the\\r\\nscientific and the mystical attitudes in a higher form than his\\r\\npredecessors, but the mystical attitude is distinctly the stronger of\\r\\nthe two, and secures ultimate victory whenever the conflict is sharp.\\r\\nplato, moreover, adopted from the eleatics the device of using logic to\\r\\ndefeat common sense, and thus to leave the field clear for mysticism--a\\r\\ndevice still employed in our own day by the adherents of the classical\\r\\ntradition.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [6] _cf._ burnet, _early greek philosophy_, pp. 85 ff.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logic used in defence of mysticism seems to me faulty as logic, and\\r\\nin a later lecture i shall criticise it on this ground. but the more\\r\\nthorough-going mystics do not employ logic, which they despise: they\\r\\nappeal instead directly to the immediate deliverance of their insight.\\r\\nnow, although fully developed mysticism is rare in the west, some\\r\\ntincture of it colours the thoughts of many people, particularly as\\r\\nregards matters on which they have strong convictions not based on\\r\\nevidence. in all who seek passionately for the fugitive and difficult\\r\\ngoods, the conviction is almost irresistible that there is in the world\\r\\nsomething deeper, more significant, than the multiplicity of little\\r\\nfacts chronicled and classified by science. behind the veil of these\\r\\nmundane things, they feel, something quite different obscurely shimmers,\\r\\nshining forth clearly in the great moments of illumination, which alone\\r\\ngive anything worthy to be called real knowledge of truth. to seek such\\r\\nmoments, therefore, is to them the way of wisdom, rather than, like the\\r\\nman of science, to observe coolly, to analyse without emotion, and to\\r\\naccept without question the equal reality of the trivial and the\\r\\nimportant.\\r\\n\\r\\nof the reality or unreality of the mystic\\'s world i know nothing. i have\\r\\nno wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which reveals\\r\\nit is not a genuine insight. what i do wish to maintain--and it is here\\r\\nthat the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that insight,\\r\\nuntested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of truth, in\\r\\nspite of the fact that much of the most important truth is first\\r\\nsuggested by its means. it is common to speak of an opposition between\\r\\ninstinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition was drawn\\r\\nin favour of reason, but under the influence of rousseau and the\\r\\nromantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by those who\\r\\nrebelled against artificial forms of government and thought, and then,\\r\\nas the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology became\\r\\nincreasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to creeds\\r\\nwhich they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the world.\\r\\nbergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to the\\r\\nposition of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. but in fact the\\r\\nopposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. instinct,\\r\\nintuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which\\r\\nsubsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it\\r\\nis possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other\\r\\nbeliefs no less instinctive. reason is a harmonising, controlling force\\r\\nrather than a creative one. even in the most purely logical realms, it\\r\\nis insight that first arrives at what is new.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single\\r\\nbeliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no\\r\\ndegree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment.\\r\\ninstinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. those in whom\\r\\nreason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards themselves,\\r\\nthough all admit it in regard to others. where instinct is least liable\\r\\nto error is in practical matters as to which right judgment is a help to\\r\\nsurvival; friendship and hostility in others, for instance, are often\\r\\nfelt with extraordinary discrimination through very careful disguises.\\r\\nbut even in such matters a wrong impression may be given by reserve or\\r\\nflattery; and in matters less directly practical, such as philosophy\\r\\ndeals with, very strong instinctive beliefs may be wholly mistaken, as\\r\\nwe may come to know through their perceived inconsistency with other\\r\\nequally strong beliefs. it is such considerations that necessitate the\\r\\nharmonising mediation of reason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual\\r\\ncompatibility, and examines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of\\r\\nerror on the one side and on the other. in this there is no opposition\\r\\nto instinct as a whole, but only to blind reliance upon some one\\r\\ninteresting aspect of instinct to the exclusion of other more\\r\\ncommonplace but not less trustworthy aspects. it is such onesidedness,\\r\\nnot instinct itself, that reason aims at correcting.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to\\r\\nbergson\\'s advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" there are, he\\r\\nsays, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. the first\\r\\nimplies that we move round the object; the second that we enter into it.\\r\\nthe first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and on the\\r\\nsymbols by which we express ourselves. the second neither depends on a\\r\\npoint of view nor relies on any symbol. the first kind of knowledge may\\r\\nbe said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those cases where it\\r\\nis possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[7] the second of these, which is\\r\\nintuition, is, he says, \"the kind of intellectual _sympathy_ by which\\r\\none places oneself within an object in order to coincide with what is\\r\\nunique in it and therefore inexpressible\" (p. 6). in illustration, he\\r\\nmentions self-knowledge: \"there is one reality, at least, which we all\\r\\nseize from within, by intuition and not by simple analysis. it is our\\r\\nown personality in its flowing through time--our self which endures\"\\r\\n(p. 8). the rest of bergson\\'s philosophy consists in reporting, through\\r\\nthe imperfect medium of words, the knowledge gained by intuition, and\\r\\nthe consequent complete condemnation of all the pretended knowledge\\r\\nderived from science and common sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [7] _introduction to metaphysics_, p. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive\\r\\nbeliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater\\r\\ntrustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.\\r\\nbergson attempts this justification in two ways--first, by explaining\\r\\nthat intellect is a purely practical faculty designed to secure\\r\\nbiological success; secondly, by mentioning remarkable feats of instinct\\r\\nin animals, and by pointing out characteristics of the world which,\\r\\nthough intuition can apprehend them, are baffling to intellect as he\\r\\ninterprets it.\\r\\n\\r\\nof bergson\\'s theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty\\r\\ndeveloped in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true\\r\\nbeliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we\\r\\nknow of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of man:\\r\\nif the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred\\r\\nhistory is presumably untrue. if, on the other hand, we agree with m.\\r\\nbergson in thinking that evolution took place as darwin believed, then\\r\\nit is not only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been\\r\\ndeveloped under the stress of practical utility. intuition is seen at\\r\\nits best where it is directly useful--for example, in regard to other\\r\\npeople\\'s characters and dispositions. bergson apparently holds that\\r\\ncapacity for this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle\\r\\nfor existence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. yet the\\r\\nsavage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake\\r\\nwith his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are not\\r\\nput to death for mathematical incompetence. all the most striking of his\\r\\ninstances of intuition in animals have a very direct survival value. the\\r\\nfact is, of course, that both intuition and intellect have been\\r\\ndeveloped because they are useful, and that, speaking broadly, they are\\r\\nuseful when they give truth and become harmful when they give falsehood.\\r\\nintellect, in civilised man, like artistic capacity, has occasionally\\r\\nbeen developed beyond the point where it is useful to the individual;\\r\\nintuition, on the other hand, seems on the whole to diminish as\\r\\ncivilisation increases. speaking broadly, it is greater in children than\\r\\nin adults, in the uneducated than in the educated. probably in dogs it\\r\\nexceeds anything to be found in human beings. but those who find in\\r\\nthese facts a recommendation of intuition ought to return to running\\r\\nwild in the woods, dyeing themselves with woad and living on hips and\\r\\nhaws.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us next examine whether intuition possesses any such infallibility\\r\\nas bergson claims for it. the best instance of it, according to him, is\\r\\nour acquaintance with ourselves; yet self-knowledge is proverbially rare\\r\\nand difficult. most men, for example, have in their nature meannesses,\\r\\nvanities, and envies of which they are quite unconscious, though even\\r\\ntheir best friends can perceive them without any difficulty. it is true\\r\\nthat intuition has a convincingness which is lacking to intellect: while\\r\\nit is present, it is almost impossible to doubt its truth. but if it\\r\\nshould appear, on examination, to be at least as fallible as intellect,\\r\\nits greater subjective certainty becomes a demerit, making it only the\\r\\nmore irresistibly deceptive. apart from self-knowledge, one of the most\\r\\nnotable examples of intuition is the knowledge people believe themselves\\r\\nto possess of those with whom they are in love: the wall between\\r\\ndifferent personalities seems to become transparent, and people think\\r\\nthey see into another soul as into their own. yet deception in such\\r\\ncases is constantly practised with success; and even where there is no\\r\\nintentional deception, experience gradually proves, as a rule, that the\\r\\nsupposed insight was illusory, and that the slower, more groping methods\\r\\nof the intellect are in the long run more reliable.\\r\\n\\r\\nbergson maintains that intellect can only deal with things in so far as\\r\\nthey resemble what has been experienced in the past, while intuition has\\r\\nthe power of apprehending the uniqueness and novelty that always belong\\r\\nto each fresh moment. that there is something unique and new at every\\r\\nmoment, is certainly true; it is also true that this cannot be fully\\r\\nexpressed by means of intellectual concepts. only direct acquaintance\\r\\ncan give knowledge of what is unique and new. but direct acquaintance of\\r\\nthis kind is given fully in sensation, and does not require, so far as i\\r\\ncan see, any special faculty of intuition for its apprehension. it is\\r\\nneither intellect nor intuition, but sensation, that supplies new data;\\r\\nbut when the data are new in any remarkable manner, intellect is much\\r\\nmore capable of dealing with them than intuition would be. the hen with\\r\\na brood of ducklings no doubt has intuitions which seem to place her\\r\\ninside them, and not merely to know them analytically; but when the\\r\\nducklings take to the water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be\\r\\nillusory, and the hen is left helpless on the shore. intuition, in fact,\\r\\nis an aspect and development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is\\r\\nadmirable in those customary surroundings which have moulded the habits\\r\\nof the animal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the\\r\\nsurroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode\\r\\nof action.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of\\r\\nphilosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or\\r\\nto savages, or even to most civilised men. it is hardly to be supposed,\\r\\ntherefore, that the rapid, rough and ready methods of instinct or\\r\\nintuition will find in this field a favourable ground for their\\r\\napplication. it is the older kinds of activity, which bring out our\\r\\nkinship with remote generations of animal and semi-human ancestors, that\\r\\nshow intuition at its best. in such matters as self-preservation and\\r\\nlove, intuition will act sometimes (though not always) with a swiftness\\r\\nand precision which are astonishing to the critical intellect. but\\r\\nphilosophy is not one of the pursuits which illustrate our affinity with\\r\\nthe past: it is a highly refined, highly civilised pursuit, demanding,\\r\\nfor its success, a certain liberation from the life of instinct, and\\r\\neven, at times, a certain aloofness from all mundane hopes and fears. it\\r\\nis not in philosophy, therefore, that we can hope to see intuition at\\r\\nits best. on the contrary, since the true objects of philosophy, and the\\r\\nhabits of thought demanded for their apprehension, are strange, unusual,\\r\\nand remote, it is here, more almost than anywhere else, that intellect\\r\\nproves superior to intuition, and that quick unanalysed convictions are\\r\\nleast deserving of uncritical acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore embarking upon the somewhat difficult and abstract discussions\\r\\nwhich lie before us, it will be well to take a survey of the hopes we\\r\\nmay retain and the hopes we must abandon. the hope of satisfaction to\\r\\nour more human desires--the hope of demonstrating that the world has\\r\\nthis or that desirable ethical characteristic--is not one which, so far\\r\\nas i can see, philosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. the\\r\\ndifference between a good world and a bad one is a difference in the\\r\\nparticular characteristics of the particular things that exist in these\\r\\nworlds: it is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the\\r\\nprovince of philosophy. love and hate, for example, are ethical\\r\\nopposites, but to philosophy they are closely analogous attitudes\\r\\ntowards objects. the general form and structure of those attitudes\\r\\ntowards objects which constitute mental phenomena is a problem for\\r\\nphilosophy; but the difference between love and hate is not a difference\\r\\nof form or structure, and therefore belongs rather to the special\\r\\nscience of psychology than to philosophy. thus the ethical interests\\r\\nwhich have often inspired philosophers must remain in the background:\\r\\nsome kind of ethical interest may inspire the whole study, but none must\\r\\nobtrude in the detail or be expected in the special results which are\\r\\nsought.\\r\\n\\r\\nif this view seems at first sight disappointing, we may remind ourselves\\r\\nthat a similar change has been found necessary in all the other\\r\\nsciences. the physicist or chemist is not now required to prove the\\r\\nethical importance of his ions or atoms; the biologist is not expected\\r\\nto prove the utility of the plants or animals which he dissects. in\\r\\npre-scientific ages this was not the case. astronomy, for example, was\\r\\nstudied because men believed in astrology: it was thought that the\\r\\nmovements of the planets had the most direct and important bearing upon\\r\\nthe lives of human beings. presumably, when this belief decayed and the\\r\\ndisinterested study of astronomy began, many who had found astrology\\r\\nabsorbingly interesting decided that astronomy had too little human\\r\\ninterest to be worthy of study. physics, as it appears in plato\\'s\\r\\n_timaeus_ for example, is full of ethical notions: it is an essential\\r\\npart of its purpose to show that the earth is worthy of admiration. the\\r\\nmodern physicist, on the contrary, though he has no wish to deny that\\r\\nthe earth is admirable, is not concerned, as physicist, with its ethical\\r\\nattributes: he is merely concerned to find out facts, not to consider\\r\\nwhether they are good or bad. in psychology, the scientific attitude is\\r\\neven more recent and more difficult than in the physical sciences: it is\\r\\nnatural to consider that human nature is either good or bad, and to\\r\\nsuppose that the difference between good and bad, so all-important in\\r\\npractice, must be important in theory also. it is only during the last\\r\\ncentury that an ethically neutral science of psychology has grown up;\\r\\nand here too ethical neutrality has been essential to scientific\\r\\nsuccess.\\r\\n\\r\\nin philosophy, hitherto, ethical neutrality has been seldom sought and\\r\\nhardly ever achieved. men have remembered their wishes, and have judged\\r\\nphilosophies in relation to their wishes. driven from the particular\\r\\nsciences, the belief that the notions of good and evil must afford a key\\r\\nto the understanding of the world has sought a refuge in philosophy. but\\r\\neven from this last refuge, if philosophy is not to remain a set of\\r\\npleasing dreams, this belief must be driven forth. it is a commonplace\\r\\nthat happiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly; and\\r\\nit would seem that the same is true of the good. in thought, at any\\r\\nrate, those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are\\r\\nmore likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the\\r\\ndistorting medium of their own desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe immense extension of our knowledge of facts in recent times has had,\\r\\nas it had in the renaissance, two effects upon the general intellectual\\r\\noutlook. on the one hand, it has made men distrustful of the truth of\\r\\nwide, ambitious systems: theories come and go swiftly, each serving, for\\r\\na moment, to classify known facts and promote the search for new ones,\\r\\nbut each in turn proving inadequate to deal with the new facts when they\\r\\nhave been found. even those who invent the theories do not, in science,\\r\\nregard them as anything but a temporary makeshift. the ideal of an\\r\\nall-embracing synthesis, such as the middle ages believed themselves to\\r\\nhave attained, recedes further and further beyond the limits of what\\r\\nseems feasible. in such a world, as in the world of montaigne, nothing\\r\\nseems worth while except the discovery of more and more facts, each in\\r\\nturn the deathblow to some cherished theory; the ordering intellect\\r\\ngrows weary, and becomes slovenly through despair.\\r\\n\\r\\non the other hand, the new facts have brought new powers; man\\'s physical\\r\\ncontrol over natural forces has been increasing with unexampled\\r\\nrapidity, and promises to increase in the future beyond all easily\\r\\nassignable limits. thus alongside of despair as regards ultimate theory\\r\\nthere is an immense optimism as regards practice: what man can _do_\\r\\nseems almost boundless. the old fixed limits of human power, such as\\r\\ndeath, or the dependence of the race on an equilibrium of cosmic forces,\\r\\nare forgotten, and no hard facts are allowed to break in upon the dream\\r\\nof omnipotence. no philosophy is tolerated which sets bounds to man\\'s\\r\\ncapacity of gratifying his wishes; and thus the very despair of theory\\r\\nis invoked to silence every whisper of doubt as regards the\\r\\npossibilities of practical achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the welcoming of new fact, and in the suspicion of dogmatism as\\r\\nregards the universe at large, the modern spirit should, i think, be\\r\\naccepted as wholly an advance. but both in its practical pretensions and\\r\\nin its theoretical despair it seems to me to go too far. most of what is\\r\\ngreatest in man is called forth in response to the thwarting of his\\r\\nhopes by immutable natural obstacles; by the pretence of omnipotence, he\\r\\nbecomes trivial and a little absurd. and on the theoretical side,\\r\\nultimate metaphysical truth, though less all-embracing and harder of\\r\\nattainment than it appeared to some philosophers in the past, can, i\\r\\nbelieve, be discovered by those who are willing to combine the\\r\\nhopefulness, patience, and open-mindedness of science with something of\\r\\nthe greek feeling for beauty in the abstract world of logic and for the\\r\\nultimate intrinsic value in the contemplation of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe philosophy, therefore, which is to be genuinely inspired by the\\r\\nscientific spirit, must deal with somewhat dry and abstract matters, and\\r\\nmust not hope to find an answer to the practical problems of life. to\\r\\nthose who wish to understand much of what has in the past been most\\r\\ndifficult and obscure in the constitution of the universe, it has great\\r\\nrewards to offer--triumphs as noteworthy as those of newton and darwin,\\r\\nand as important in the long run, for the moulding of our mental habits.\\r\\nand it brings with it--as a new and powerful method of investigation\\r\\nalways does--a sense of power and a hope of progress more reliable and\\r\\nbetter grounded than any that rests on hasty and fallacious\\r\\ngeneralisation as to the nature of the universe at large. many hopes\\r\\nwhich inspired philosophers in the past it cannot claim to fulfil; but\\r\\nother hopes, more purely intellectual, it can satisfy more fully than\\r\\nformer ages could have deemed possible for human minds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture ii\\r\\n\\r\\nlogic as the essence of philosophy\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe topics we discussed in our first lecture, and the topics we shall\\r\\ndiscuss later, all reduce themselves, in so far as they are genuinely\\r\\nphilosophical, to problems of logic. this is not due to any accident,\\r\\nbut to the fact that every philosophical problem, when it is subjected\\r\\nto the necessary analysis and purification, is found either to be not\\r\\nreally philosophical at all, or else to be, in the sense in which we are\\r\\nusing the word, logical. but as the word \"logic\" is never used in the\\r\\nsame sense by two different philosophers, some explanation of what i\\r\\nmean by the word is indispensable at the outset.\\r\\n\\r\\nlogic, in the middle ages, and down to the present day in teaching,\\r\\nmeant no more than a scholastic collection of technical terms and rules\\r\\nof syllogistic inference. aristotle had spoken, and it was the part of\\r\\nhumbler men merely to repeat the lesson after him. the trivial nonsense\\r\\nembodied in this tradition is still set in examinations, and defended by\\r\\neminent authorities as an excellent \"propaedeutic,\" _i.e._ a training in\\r\\nthose habits of solemn humbug which are so great a help in later life.\\r\\nbut it is not this that i mean to praise in saying that all philosophy\\r\\nis logic. ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century, all\\r\\nvigorous minds that have concerned themselves with inference have\\r\\nabandoned the mediaeval tradition, and in one way or other have widened\\r\\nthe scope of logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first extension was the introduction of the inductive method by\\r\\nbacon and galileo--by the former in a theoretical and largely mistaken\\r\\nform, by the latter in actual use in establishing the foundations of\\r\\nmodern physics and astronomy. this is probably the only extension of the\\r\\nold logic which has become familiar to the general educated public. but\\r\\ninduction, important as it is when regarded as a method of\\r\\ninvestigation, does not seem to remain when its work is done: in the\\r\\nfinal form of a perfected science, it would seem that everything ought\\r\\nto be deductive. if induction remains at all, which is a difficult\\r\\nquestion, it will remain merely as one of the principles according to\\r\\nwhich deductions are effected. thus the ultimate result of the\\r\\nintroduction of the inductive method seems not the creation of a new\\r\\nkind of non-deductive reasoning, but rather the widening of the scope of\\r\\ndeduction by pointing out a way of deducing which is certainly not\\r\\nsyllogistic, and does not fit into the mediaeval scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question of the scope and validity of induction is of great\\r\\ndifficulty, and of great importance to our knowledge. take such a\\r\\nquestion as, \"will the sun rise to-morrow?\" our first instinctive\\r\\nfeeling is that we have abundant reason for saying that it will, because\\r\\nit has risen on so many previous mornings. now, i do not myself know\\r\\nwhether this does afford a ground or not, but i am willing to suppose\\r\\nthat it does. the question which then arises is: what is the principle\\r\\nof inference by which we pass from past sunrises to future ones? the\\r\\nanswer given by mill is that the inference depends upon the law of\\r\\ncausation. let us suppose this to be true; then what is the reason for\\r\\nbelieving in the law of causation? there are broadly three possible\\r\\nanswers: (1) that it is itself known _a priori_; (2) that it is a\\r\\npostulate; (3) that it is an empirical generalisation from past\\r\\ninstances in which it has been found to hold. the theory that causation\\r\\nis known _a priori_ cannot be definitely refuted, but it can be rendered\\r\\nvery unplausible by the mere process of formulating the law exactly, and\\r\\nthereby showing that it is immensely more complicated and less obvious\\r\\nthan is generally supposed. the theory that causation is a postulate,\\r\\n_i.e._ that it is something which we choose to assert although we know\\r\\nthat it is very likely false, is also incapable of refutation; but it is\\r\\nplainly also incapable of justifying any use of the law in inference. we\\r\\nare thus brought to the theory that the law is an empirical\\r\\ngeneralisation, which is the view held by mill.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut if so, how are empirical generalisations to be justified? the\\r\\nevidence in their favour cannot be empirical, since we wish to argue\\r\\nfrom what has been observed to what has not been observed, which can\\r\\nonly be done by means of some known relation of the observed and the\\r\\nunobserved; but the unobserved, by definition, is not known empirically,\\r\\nand therefore its relation to the observed, if known at all, must be\\r\\nknown independently of empirical evidence. let us see what mill says on\\r\\nthis subject.\\r\\n\\r\\naccording to mill, the law of causation is proved by an admittedly\\r\\nfallible process called \"induction by simple enumeration.\" this process,\\r\\nhe says, \"consists in ascribing the nature of general truths to all\\r\\npropositions which are true in every instance that we happen to know\\r\\nof.\"[8] as regards its fallibility, he asserts that \"the precariousness\\r\\nof the method of simple enumeration is in an inverse ratio to the\\r\\nlargeness of the generalisation. the process is delusive and\\r\\ninsufficient, exactly in proportion as the subject-matter of the\\r\\nobservation is special and limited in extent. as the sphere widens, this\\r\\nunscientific method becomes less and less liable to mislead; and the\\r\\nmost universal class of truths, the law of causation for instance, and\\r\\nthe principles of number and of geometry, are duly and satisfactorily\\r\\nproved by that method alone, nor are they susceptible of any other\\r\\nproof.\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [8] _logic_, book iii., chapter iii., sec. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [9] book iii., chapter xxi., sec. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the above statement, there are two obvious lacunae: (1) how is the\\r\\nmethod of simple enumeration itself justified? (2) what logical\\r\\nprinciple, if any, covers the same ground as this method, without being\\r\\nliable to its failures? let us take the second question first.\\r\\n\\r\\na method of proof which, when used as directed, gives sometimes truth\\r\\nand sometimes falsehood--as the method of simple enumeration does--is\\r\\nobviously not a valid method, for validity demands invariable truth.\\r\\nthus, if simple enumeration is to be rendered valid, it must not be\\r\\nstated as mill states it. we shall have to say, at most, that the data\\r\\nrender the result _probable_. causation holds, we shall say, in every\\r\\ninstance we have been able to test; therefore it _probably_ holds in\\r\\nuntested instances. there are terrible difficulties in the notion of\\r\\nprobability, but we may ignore them at present. we thus have what at\\r\\nleast _may_ be a logical principle, since it is without exception. if a\\r\\nproposition is true in every instance that we happen to know of, and if\\r\\nthe instances are very numerous, then, we shall say, it becomes very\\r\\nprobable, on the data, that it will be true in any further instance.\\r\\nthis is not refuted by the fact that what we declare to be probable does\\r\\nnot always happen, for an event may be probable on the data and yet not\\r\\noccur. it is, however, obviously capable of further analysis, and of\\r\\nmore exact statement. we shall have to say something like this: that\\r\\nevery instance of a proposition[10] being true increases the probability\\r\\nof its being true in a fresh instance, and that a sufficient number of\\r\\nfavourable instances will, in the absence of instances to the contrary,\\r\\nmake the probability of the truth of a fresh instance approach\\r\\nindefinitely near to certainty. some such principle as this is required\\r\\nif the method of simple enumeration is to be valid.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [10] or rather a propositional function.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut this brings us to our other question, namely, how is our principle\\r\\nknown to be true? obviously, since it is required to justify induction,\\r\\nit cannot be proved by induction; since it goes beyond the empirical\\r\\ndata, it cannot be proved by them alone; since it is required to justify\\r\\nall inferences from empirical data to what goes beyond them, it cannot\\r\\nitself be even rendered in any degree probable by such data. hence, _if_\\r\\nit is known, it is not known by experience, but independently of\\r\\nexperience. i do not say that any such principle is known: i only say\\r\\nthat it is required to justify the inferences from experience which\\r\\nempiricists allow, and that it cannot itself be justified\\r\\nempirically.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [11] the subject of causality and induction will be discussed again in\\r\\n  lecture viii.\\r\\n\\r\\na similar conclusion can be proved by similar arguments concerning any\\r\\nother logical principle. thus logical knowledge is not derivable from\\r\\nexperience alone, and the empiricist\\'s philosophy can therefore not be\\r\\naccepted in its entirety, in spite of its excellence in many matters\\r\\nwhich lie outside logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nhegel and his followers widened the scope of logic in quite a different\\r\\nway--a way which i believe to be fallacious, but which requires\\r\\ndiscussion if only to show how their conception of logic differs from\\r\\nthe conception which i wish to advocate. in their writings, logic is\\r\\npractically identical with metaphysics. in broad outline, the way this\\r\\ncame about is as follows. hegel believed that, by means of _a priori_\\r\\nreasoning, it could be shown that the world _must_ have various\\r\\nimportant and interesting characteristics, since any world without these\\r\\ncharacteristics would be impossible and self-contradictory. thus what he\\r\\ncalls \"logic\" is an investigation of the nature of the universe, in so\\r\\nfar as this can be inferred merely from the principle that the universe\\r\\nmust be logically self-consistent. i do not myself believe that from\\r\\nthis principle alone anything of importance can be inferred as regards\\r\\nthe existing universe. but, however that may be, i should not regard\\r\\nhegel\\'s reasoning, even if it were valid, as properly belonging to\\r\\nlogic: it would rather be an application of logic to the actual world.\\r\\nlogic itself would be concerned rather with such questions as what\\r\\nself-consistency is, which hegel, so far as i know, does not discuss.\\r\\nand though he criticises the traditional logic, and professes to replace\\r\\nit by an improved logic of his own, there is some sense in which the\\r\\ntraditional logic, with all its faults, is uncritically and\\r\\nunconsciously assumed throughout his reasoning. it is not in the\\r\\ndirection advocated by him, it seems to me, that the reform of logic is\\r\\nto be sought, but by a more fundamental, more patient, and less\\r\\nambitious investigation into the presuppositions which his system shares\\r\\nwith those of most other philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe way in which, as it seems to me, hegel\\'s system assumes the ordinary\\r\\nlogic which it subsequently criticises, is exemplified by the general\\r\\nconception of \"categories\" with which he operates throughout. this\\r\\nconception is, i think, essentially a product of logical confusion, but\\r\\nit seems in some way to stand for the conception of \"qualities of\\r\\nreality as a whole.\" mr bradley has worked out a theory according to\\r\\nwhich, in all judgment, we are ascribing a predicate to reality as a\\r\\nwhole; and this theory is derived from hegel. now the traditional logic\\r\\nholds that every proposition ascribes a predicate to a subject, and from\\r\\nthis it easily follows that there can be only one subject, the absolute,\\r\\nfor if there were two, the proposition that there were two would not\\r\\nascribe a predicate to either. thus hegel\\'s doctrine, that philosophical\\r\\npropositions must be of the form, \"the absolute is such-and-such,\"\\r\\ndepends upon the traditional belief in the universality of the\\r\\nsubject-predicate form. this belief, being traditional, scarcely\\r\\nself-conscious, and not supposed to be important, operates underground,\\r\\nand is assumed in arguments which, like the refutation of relations,\\r\\nappear at first sight such as to establish its truth. this is the most\\r\\nimportant respect in which hegel uncritically assumes the traditional\\r\\nlogic. other less important respects--though important enough to be the\\r\\nsource of such essentially hegelian conceptions as the \"concrete\\r\\nuniversal\" and the \"union of identity in difference\"--will be found\\r\\nwhere he explicitly deals with formal logic.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [12] see the translation by h. s. macran, _hegel\\'s doctrine of formal\\r\\n  logic_, oxford, 1912. hegel\\'s argument in this portion of his \"logic\"\\r\\n  depends throughout upon confusing the \"is\" of predication, as in\\r\\n  \"socrates is mortal,\" with the \"is\" of identity, as in \"socrates is\\r\\n  the philosopher who drank the hemlock.\" owing to this confusion, he\\r\\n  thinks that \"socrates\" and \"mortal\" must be identical. seeing that\\r\\n  they are different, he does not infer, as others would, that there is\\r\\n  a mistake somewhere, but that they exhibit \"identity in difference.\"\\r\\n  again, socrates is particular, \"mortal\" is universal. therefore, he\\r\\n  says, since socrates is mortal, it follows that the particular is the\\r\\n  universal--taking the \"is\" to be throughout expressive of identity.\\r\\n  but to say \"the particular is the universal\" is self-contradictory.\\r\\n  again hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise\\r\\n  particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal.\\r\\n  this is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and\\r\\n  imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial\\r\\n  confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are\\r\\n  unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is quite another direction in which a large technical development\\r\\nof logic has taken place: i mean the direction of what is called\\r\\nlogistic or mathematical logic. this kind of logic is mathematical in\\r\\ntwo different senses: it is itself a branch of mathematics, and it is\\r\\nthe logic which is specially applicable to other more traditional\\r\\nbranches of mathematics. historically, it began as _merely_ a branch of\\r\\nmathematics: its special applicability to other branches is a more\\r\\nrecent development. in both respects, it is the fulfilment of a hope\\r\\nwhich leibniz cherished throughout his life, and pursued with all the\\r\\nardour of his amazing intellectual energy. much of his work on this\\r\\nsubject has been published recently, since his discoveries have been\\r\\nremade by others; but none was published by him, because his results\\r\\npersisted in contradicting certain points in the traditional doctrine of\\r\\nthe syllogism. we now know that on these points the traditional doctrine\\r\\nis wrong, but respect for aristotle prevented leibniz from realising\\r\\nthat this was possible.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [13] _cf._ couturat, _la logique de leibniz_, pp. 361, 386.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe modern development of mathematical logic dates from boole\\'s _laws of\\r\\nthought_ (1854). but in him and his successors, before peano and frege,\\r\\nthe only thing really achieved, apart from certain details, was the\\r\\ninvention of a mathematical symbolism for deducing consequences from the\\r\\npremisses which the newer methods shared with those of aristotle. this\\r\\nsubject has considerable interest as an independent branch of\\r\\nmathematics, but it has very little to do with real logic. the first\\r\\nserious advance in real logic since the time of the greeks was made\\r\\nindependently by peano and frege--both mathematicians. they both arrived\\r\\nat their logical results by an analysis of mathematics. traditional\\r\\nlogic regarded the two propositions, \"socrates is mortal\" and \"all men\\r\\nare mortal,\" as being of the same form;[14] peano and frege showed that\\r\\nthey are utterly different in form. the philosophical importance of\\r\\nlogic may be illustrated by the fact that this confusion--which is still\\r\\ncommitted by most writers--obscured not only the whole study of the\\r\\nforms of judgment and inference, but also the relations of things to\\r\\ntheir qualities, of concrete existence to abstract concepts, and of the\\r\\nworld of sense to the world of platonic ideas. peano and frege, who\\r\\npointed out the error, did so for technical reasons, and applied their\\r\\nlogic mainly to technical developments; but the philosophical importance\\r\\nof the advance which they made is impossible to exaggerate.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [14] it was often recognised that there was _some_ difference between\\r\\n  them, but it was not recognised that the difference is fundamental,\\r\\n  and of very great importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nmathematical logic, even in its most modern form, is not _directly_ of\\r\\nphilosophical importance except in its beginnings. after the beginnings,\\r\\nit belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy. of its beginnings,\\r\\nwhich are the only part of it that can properly be called\\r\\n_philosophical_ logic, i shall speak shortly. but even the later\\r\\ndevelopments, though not directly philosophical, will be found of great\\r\\nindirect use in philosophising. they enable us to deal easily with more\\r\\nabstract conceptions than merely verbal reasoning can enumerate; they\\r\\nsuggest fruitful hypotheses which otherwise could hardly be thought of;\\r\\nand they enable us to see quickly what is the smallest store of\\r\\nmaterials with which a given logical or scientific edifice can be\\r\\nconstructed. not only frege\\'s theory of number, which we shall deal with\\r\\nin lecture vii., but the whole theory of physical concepts which will be\\r\\noutlined in our next two lectures, is inspired by mathematical logic,\\r\\nand could never have been imagined without it.\\r\\n\\r\\nin both these cases, and in many others, we shall appeal to a certain\\r\\nprinciple called \"the principle of abstraction.\" this principle, which\\r\\nmight equally well be called \"the principle which dispenses with\\r\\nabstraction,\" and is one which clears away incredible accumulations of\\r\\nmetaphysical lumber, was directly suggested by mathematical logic, and\\r\\ncould hardly have been proved or practically used without its help. the\\r\\nprinciple will be explained in our fourth lecture, but its use may be\\r\\nbriefly indicated in advance. when a group of objects have that kind of\\r\\nsimilarity which we are inclined to attribute to possession of a common\\r\\nquality, the principle in question shows that membership of the group\\r\\nwill serve all the purposes of the supposed common quality, and that\\r\\ntherefore, unless some common quality is actually known, the group or\\r\\nclass of similar objects may be used to replace the common quality,\\r\\nwhich need not be assumed to exist. in this and other ways, the indirect\\r\\nuses of even the later parts of mathematical logic are very great; but\\r\\nit is now time to turn our attention to its philosophical foundations.\\r\\n\\r\\nin every proposition and in every inference there is, besides the\\r\\nparticular subject-matter concerned, a certain _form_, a way in which\\r\\nthe constituents of the proposition or inference are put together. if i\\r\\nsay, \"socrates is mortal,\" \"jones is angry,\" \"the sun is hot,\" there is\\r\\nsomething in common in these three cases, something indicated by the\\r\\nword \"is.\" what is in common is the _form_ of the proposition, not an\\r\\nactual constituent. if i say a number of things about socrates--that he\\r\\nwas an athenian, that he married xantippe, that he drank the\\r\\nhemlock--there is a common constituent, namely socrates, in all the\\r\\npropositions i enunciate, but they have diverse forms. if, on the other\\r\\nhand, i take any one of these propositions and replace its constituents,\\r\\none at a time, by other constituents, the form remains constant, but no\\r\\nconstituent remains. take (say) the series of propositions, \"socrates\\r\\ndrank the hemlock,\" \"coleridge drank the hemlock,\" \"coleridge drank\\r\\nopium,\" \"coleridge ate opium.\" the form remains unchanged throughout\\r\\nthis series, but all the constituents are altered. thus form is not\\r\\nanother constituent, but is the way the constituents are put together.\\r\\nit is forms, in this sense, that are the proper object of philosophical\\r\\nlogic.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is obvious that the knowledge of logical forms is something quite\\r\\ndifferent from knowledge of existing things. the form of \"socrates drank\\r\\nthe hemlock\" is not an existing thing like socrates or the hemlock, nor\\r\\ndoes it even have that close relation to existing things that drinking\\r\\nhas. it is something altogether more abstract and remote. we might\\r\\nunderstand all the separate words of a sentence without understanding\\r\\nthe sentence: if a sentence is long and complicated, this is apt to\\r\\nhappen. in such a case we have knowledge of the constituents, but not of\\r\\nthe form. we may also have knowledge of the form without having\\r\\nknowledge of the constituents. if i say, \"rorarius drank the hemlock,\"\\r\\nthose among you who have never heard of rorarius (supposing there are\\r\\nany) will understand the form, without having knowledge of all the\\r\\nconstituents. in order to understand a sentence, it is necessary to have\\r\\nknowledge both of the constituents and of the particular instance of the\\r\\nform. it is in this way that a sentence conveys information, since it\\r\\ntells us that certain known objects are related according to a certain\\r\\nknown form. thus some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with\\r\\nmost people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of\\r\\ndiscourse. it is the business of philosophical logic to extract this\\r\\nknowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and\\r\\npure.\\r\\n\\r\\nin all inference, form alone is essential: the particular subject-matter\\r\\nis irrelevant except as securing the truth of the premisses. this is one\\r\\nreason for the great importance of logical form. when i say, \"socrates\\r\\nwas a man, all men are mortal, therefore socrates was mortal,\" the\\r\\nconnection of premisses and conclusion does not in any way depend upon\\r\\nits being socrates and man and mortality that i am mentioning. the\\r\\ngeneral form of the inference may be expressed in some such words as,\\r\\n\"if a thing has a certain property, and whatever has this property has a\\r\\ncertain other property, then the thing in question also has that other\\r\\nproperty.\" here no particular things or properties are mentioned: the\\r\\nproposition is absolutely general. all inferences, when stated fully,\\r\\nare instances of propositions having this kind of generality. if they\\r\\nseem to depend upon the subject-matter otherwise than as regards the\\r\\ntruth of the premisses, that is because the premisses have not been all\\r\\nexplicitly stated. in logic, it is a waste of time to deal with\\r\\ninferences concerning particular cases: we deal throughout with\\r\\ncompletely general and purely formal implications, leaving it to other\\r\\nsciences to discover when the hypotheses are verified and when they are\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the forms of propositions giving rise to inferences are not the\\r\\nsimplest forms: they are always hypothetical, stating that if one\\r\\nproposition is true, then so is another. before considering inference,\\r\\ntherefore, logic must consider those simpler forms which inference\\r\\npresupposes. here the traditional logic failed completely: it believed\\r\\nthat there was only one form of simple proposition (_i.e._ of\\r\\nproposition not stating a relation between two or more other\\r\\npropositions), namely, the form which ascribes a predicate to a subject.\\r\\nthis is the appropriate form in assigning the qualities of a given\\r\\nthing--we may say \"this thing is round, and red, and so on.\" grammar\\r\\nfavours this form, but philosophically it is so far from universal that\\r\\nit is not even very common. if we say \"this thing is bigger than that,\"\\r\\nwe are not assigning a mere quality of \"this,\" but a relation of \"this\"\\r\\nand \"that.\" we might express the same fact by saying \"that thing is\\r\\nsmaller than this,\" where grammatically the subject is changed. thus\\r\\npropositions stating that two things have a certain relation have a\\r\\ndifferent form from subject-predicate propositions, and the failure to\\r\\nperceive this difference or to allow for it has been the source of many\\r\\nerrors in traditional metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the\\r\\nsubject-predicate form--in other words, that every fact consists in some\\r\\nthing having some quality--has rendered most philosophers incapable of\\r\\ngiving any account of the world of science and daily life. if they had\\r\\nbeen honestly anxious to give such an account, they would probably have\\r\\ndiscovered their error very quickly; but most of them were less anxious\\r\\nto understand the world of science and daily life, than to convict it of\\r\\nunreality in the interests of a super-sensible \"real\" world. belief in\\r\\nthe unreality of the world of sense arises with irresistible force in\\r\\ncertain moods--moods which, i imagine, have some simple physiological\\r\\nbasis, but are none the less powerfully persuasive. the conviction born\\r\\nof these moods is the source of most mysticism and of most metaphysics.\\r\\nwhen the emotional intensity of such a mood subsides, a man who is in\\r\\nthe habit of reasoning will search for logical reasons in favour of the\\r\\nbelief which he finds in himself. but since the belief already exists,\\r\\nhe will be very hospitable to any reason that suggests itself. the\\r\\nparadoxes apparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of\\r\\nmysticism, and are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is\\r\\nto be in accordance with insight. it is in this way that logic has been\\r\\npursued by those of the great philosophers who were mystics--notably\\r\\nplato, spinoza, and hegel. but since they usually took for granted the\\r\\nsupposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines were\\r\\npresented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their disciples\\r\\nto be quite independent of the sudden illumination from which they\\r\\nsprang. nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they remained--to\\r\\nborrow a useful word from mr santayana--\"malicious\" in regard to the\\r\\nworld of science and common sense. it is only so that we can account for\\r\\nthe complacency with which philosophers have accepted the inconsistency\\r\\nof their doctrines with all the common and scientific facts which seem\\r\\nbest established and most worthy of belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are\\r\\ninherent in anything malicious. while the mystic mood is dominant, the\\r\\nneed of logic is not felt; as the mood fades, the impulse to logic\\r\\nreasserts itself, but with a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or\\r\\nat least to prove that it _was_ insight, and that what seems to\\r\\ncontradict it is illusion. the logic which thus arises is not quite\\r\\ndisinterested or candid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the\\r\\ndaily world to which it is to be applied. such an attitude naturally\\r\\ndoes not tend to the best results. everyone knows that to read an author\\r\\nsimply in order to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to\\r\\nread the book of nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is\\r\\njust as unlikely to lead to understanding. if our logic is to find the\\r\\ncommon world intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired\\r\\nby a genuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among\\r\\nmetaphysicians.\\r\\n\\r\\ntraditional logic, since it holds that all propositions have the\\r\\nsubject-predicate form, is unable to admit the reality of relations: all\\r\\nrelations, it maintains, must be reduced to properties of the apparently\\r\\nrelated terms. there are many ways of refuting this opinion; one of the\\r\\neasiest is derived from the consideration of what are called\\r\\n\"asymmetrical\" relations. in order to explain this, i will first explain\\r\\ntwo independent ways of classifying relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome relations, when they hold between a and b, also hold between b and\\r\\na. such, for example, is the relation \"brother or sister.\" if a is a\\r\\nbrother or sister of b, then b is a brother or sister of a. such again\\r\\nis any kind of similarity, say similarity of colour. any kind of\\r\\ndissimilarity is also of this kind: if the colour of a is unlike the\\r\\ncolour of b, then the colour of b is unlike the colour of a. relations\\r\\nof this sort are called _symmetrical_. thus a relation is symmetrical\\r\\nif, whenever it holds between a and b, it also holds between b and a.\\r\\n\\r\\nall relations that are not symmetrical are called _non-symmetrical_.\\r\\nthus \"brother\" is non-symmetrical, because, if a is a brother of b, it\\r\\nmay happen that b is a _sister_ of a.\\r\\n\\r\\na relation is called _asymmetrical_ when, if it holds between a and b,\\r\\nit _never_ holds between b and a. thus husband, father, grandfather,\\r\\netc., are asymmetrical relations. so are _before_, _after_, _greater_,\\r\\n_above_, _to the right of_, etc. all the relations that give rise to\\r\\nseries are of this kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nclassification into symmetrical, asymmetrical, and merely\\r\\nnon-symmetrical relations is the first of the two classifications we had\\r\\nto consider. the second is into transitive, intransitive, and merely\\r\\nnon-transitive relations, which are defined as follows.\\r\\n\\r\\na relation is said to be _transitive_, if, whenever it holds between a\\r\\nand b and also between b and c, it holds between a and c. thus _before_,\\r\\n_after_, _greater_, _above_ are transitive. all relations giving rise to\\r\\nseries are transitive, but so are many others. the transitive relations\\r\\njust mentioned were asymmetrical, but many transitive relations are\\r\\nsymmetrical--for instance, equality in any respect, exact identity of\\r\\ncolour, being equally numerous (as applied to collections), and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\na relation is said to be _non-transitive_ whenever it is not transitive.\\r\\nthus \"brother\" is non-transitive, because a brother of one\\'s brother may\\r\\nbe oneself. all kinds of dissimilarity are non-transitive.\\r\\n\\r\\na relation is said to be _intransitive_ when, if a has the relation to\\r\\nb, and b to c, a never has it to c. thus \"father\" is intransitive. so is\\r\\nsuch a relation as \"one inch taller\" or \"one year later.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us now, in the light of this classification, return to the question\\r\\nwhether all relations can be reduced to predications.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the case of symmetrical relations--_i.e._ relations which, if they\\r\\nhold between a and b, also hold between b and a--some kind of\\r\\nplausibility can be given to this doctrine. a symmetrical relation which\\r\\nis transitive, such as equality, can be regarded as expressing\\r\\npossession of some common property, while one which is not transitive,\\r\\nsuch as inequality, can be regarded as expressing possession of\\r\\ndifferent properties. but when we come to asymmetrical relations, such\\r\\nas before and after, greater and less, etc., the attempt to reduce them\\r\\nto properties becomes obviously impossible. when, for example, two\\r\\nthings are merely known to be unequal, without our knowing which is\\r\\ngreater, we may say that the inequality results from their having\\r\\ndifferent magnitudes, because inequality is a symmetrical relation; but\\r\\nto say that when one thing is _greater_ than another, and not merely\\r\\nunequal to it, that means that they have different magnitudes, is\\r\\nformally incapable of explaining the facts. for if the other thing had\\r\\nbeen greater than the one, the magnitudes would also have been\\r\\ndifferent, though the fact to be explained would not have been the same.\\r\\nthus mere _difference_ of magnitude is not _all_ that is involved,\\r\\nsince, if it were, there would be no difference between one thing being\\r\\ngreater than another, and the other being greater than the one. we shall\\r\\nhave to say that the one magnitude is _greater_ than the other, and thus\\r\\nwe shall have failed to get rid of the relation \"greater.\" in short,\\r\\nboth possession of the same property and possession of different\\r\\nproperties are _symmetrical_ relations, and therefore cannot account for\\r\\nthe existence of _asymmetrical_ relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nasymmetrical relations are involved in all series--in space and time,\\r\\ngreater and less, whole and part, and many others of the most important\\r\\ncharacteristics of the actual world. all these aspects, therefore, the\\r\\nlogic which reduces everything to subjects and predicates is compelled\\r\\nto condemn as error and mere appearance. to those whose logic is not\\r\\nmalicious, such a wholesale condemnation appears impossible. and in fact\\r\\nthere is no reason except prejudice, so far as i can discover, for\\r\\ndenying the reality of relations. when once their reality is admitted,\\r\\nall _logical_ grounds for supposing the world of sense to be illusory\\r\\ndisappear. if this is to be supposed, it must be frankly and simply on\\r\\nthe ground of mystic insight unsupported by argument. it is impossible\\r\\nto argue against what professes to be insight, so long as it does not\\r\\nargue in its own favour. as logicians, therefore, we may admit the\\r\\npossibility of the mystic\\'s world, while yet, so long as we do not have\\r\\nhis insight, we must continue to study the everyday world with which we\\r\\nare familiar. but when he contends that our world is impossible, then\\r\\nour logic is ready to repel his attack. and the first step in creating\\r\\nthe logic which is to perform this service is the recognition of the\\r\\nreality of relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nrelations which have two terms are only one kind of relations. a\\r\\nrelation may have three terms, or four, or any number. relations of two\\r\\nterms, being the simplest, have received more attention than the others,\\r\\nand have generally been alone considered by philosophers, both those who\\r\\naccepted and those who denied the reality of relations. but other\\r\\nrelations have their importance, and are indispensable in the solution\\r\\nof certain problems. jealousy, for example, is a relation between three\\r\\npeople. professor royce mentions the relation \"giving\": when a gives b\\r\\nto c, that is a relation of three terms.[15] when a man says to his\\r\\nwife: \"my dear, i wish you could induce angelina to accept edwin,\" his\\r\\nwish constitutes a relation between four people, himself, his wife,\\r\\nangelina, and edwin. thus such relations are by no means recondite or\\r\\nrare. but in order to explain exactly how they differ from relations of\\r\\ntwo terms, we must embark upon a classification of the logical forms of\\r\\nfacts, which is the first business of logic, and the business in which\\r\\nthe traditional logic has been most deficient.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [15] _encyclopaedia of the philosophical sciences_, vol. i. p. 97.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe existing world consists of many things with many qualities and\\r\\nrelations. a complete description of the existing world would require\\r\\nnot only a catalogue of the things, but also a mention of all their\\r\\nqualities and relations. we should have to know not only this, that, and\\r\\nthe other thing, but also which was red, which yellow, which was earlier\\r\\nthan which, which was between which two others, and so on. when i speak\\r\\nof a \"fact,\" i do not mean one of the simple things in the world; i mean\\r\\nthat a certain thing has a certain quality, or that certain things have\\r\\na certain relation. thus, for example, i should not call napoleon a\\r\\nfact, but i should call it a fact that he was ambitious, or that he\\r\\nmarried josephine. now a fact, in this sense, is never simple, but\\r\\nalways has two or more constituents. when it simply assigns a quality to\\r\\na thing, it has only two constituents, the thing and the quality. when\\r\\nit consists of a relation between two things, it has three constituents,\\r\\nthe things and the relation. when it consists of a relation between\\r\\nthree things, it has four constituents, and so on. the constituents of\\r\\nfacts, in the sense in which we are using the word \"fact,\" are not other\\r\\nfacts, but are things and qualities or relations. when we say that there\\r\\nare relations of more than two terms, we mean that there are single\\r\\nfacts consisting of a single relation and more than two things. i do not\\r\\nmean that one relation of two terms may hold between a and b, and also\\r\\nbetween a and c, as, for example, a man is the son of his father and\\r\\nalso the son of his mother. this constitutes two distinct facts: if we\\r\\nchoose to treat it as one fact, it is a fact which has facts for its\\r\\nconstituents. but the facts i am speaking of have no facts among their\\r\\nconstituents, but only things and relations. for example, when a is\\r\\njealous of b on account of c, there is only one fact, involving three\\r\\npeople; there are not two instances of jealousy, but only one. it is in\\r\\nsuch cases that i speak of a relation of three terms, where the simplest\\r\\npossible fact in which the relation occurs is one involving three things\\r\\nin addition to the relation. and the same applies to relations of four\\r\\nterms or five or any other number. all such relations must be admitted\\r\\nin our inventory of the logical forms of facts: two facts involving the\\r\\nsame number of things have the same form, and two which involve\\r\\ndifferent numbers of things have different forms.\\r\\n\\r\\ngiven any fact, there is an assertion which expresses the fact. the fact\\r\\nitself is objective, and independent of our thought or opinion about it;\\r\\nbut the assertion is something which involves thought, and may be either\\r\\ntrue or false. an assertion may be positive or negative: we may assert\\r\\nthat charles i. was executed, or that he did _not_ die in his bed. a\\r\\nnegative assertion may be said to be a _denial_. given a form of words\\r\\nwhich must be either true or false, such as \"charles i. died in his\\r\\nbed,\" we may either assert or deny this form of words: in the one case\\r\\nwe have a positive assertion, in the other a negative one. a form of\\r\\nwords which must be either true or false i shall call a _proposition_.\\r\\nthus a proposition is the same as what may be significantly asserted or\\r\\ndenied. a proposition which expresses what we have called a fact, _i.e._\\r\\nwhich, when asserted, asserts that a certain thing has a certain\\r\\nquality, or that certain things have a certain relation, will be called\\r\\nan atomic proposition, because, as we shall see immediately, there are\\r\\nother propositions into which atomic propositions enter in a way\\r\\nanalogous to that in which atoms enter into molecules. atomic\\r\\npropositions, although, like facts, they may have any one of an infinite\\r\\nnumber of forms, are only one kind of propositions. all other kinds are\\r\\nmore complicated. in order to preserve the parallelism in language as\\r\\nregards facts and propositions, we shall give the name \"atomic facts\" to\\r\\nthe facts we have hitherto been considering. thus atomic facts are what\\r\\ndetermine whether atomic propositions are to be asserted or denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhether an atomic proposition, such as \"this is red,\" or \"this is before\\r\\nthat,\" is to be asserted or denied can only be known empirically.\\r\\nperhaps one atomic fact may sometimes be capable of being inferred from\\r\\nanother, though this seems very doubtful; but in any case it cannot be\\r\\ninferred from premisses no one of which is an atomic fact. it follows\\r\\nthat, if atomic facts are to be known at all, some at least must be\\r\\nknown without inference. the atomic facts which we come to know in this\\r\\nway are the facts of sense-perception; at any rate, the facts of\\r\\nsense-perception are those which we most obviously and certainly come to\\r\\nknow in this way. if we knew all atomic facts, and also knew that there\\r\\nwere none except those we knew, we should, theoretically, be able to\\r\\ninfer all truths of whatever form.[16] thus logic would then supply us\\r\\nwith the whole of the apparatus required. but in the first acquisition\\r\\nof knowledge concerning atomic facts, logic is useless. in pure logic,\\r\\nno atomic fact is ever mentioned: we confine ourselves wholly to forms,\\r\\nwithout asking ourselves what objects can fill the forms. thus pure\\r\\nlogic is independent of atomic facts; but conversely, they are, in a\\r\\nsense, independent of logic. pure logic and atomic facts are the two\\r\\npoles, the wholly _a priori_ and the wholly empirical. but between the\\r\\ntwo lies a vast intermediate region, which we must now briefly explore.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [16] this perhaps requires modification in order to include such facts\\r\\n  as beliefs and wishes, since such facts apparently contain\\r\\n  propositions as components. such facts, though not strictly atomic,\\r\\n  must be supposed included if the statement in the text is to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"molecular\" propositions are such as contain conjunctions--_if_, _or_,\\r\\n_and_, _unless_, etc.--and such words are the marks of a molecular\\r\\nproposition. consider such an assertion as, \"if it rains, i shall bring\\r\\nmy umbrella.\" this assertion is just as capable of truth or falsehood as\\r\\nthe assertion of an atomic proposition, but it is obvious that either\\r\\nthe corresponding fact, or the nature of the correspondence with fact,\\r\\nmust be quite different from what it is in the case of an atomic\\r\\nproposition. whether it rains, and whether i bring my umbrella, are each\\r\\nseverally matters of atomic fact, ascertainable by observation. but the\\r\\nconnection of the two involved in saying that _if_ the one happens,\\r\\n_then_ the other will happen, is something radically different from\\r\\neither of the two separately. it does not require for its truth that it\\r\\nshould actually rain, or that i should actually bring my umbrella; even\\r\\nif the weather is cloudless, it may still be true that i should have\\r\\nbrought my umbrella if the weather had been different. thus we have here\\r\\na connection of two propositions, which does not depend upon whether\\r\\nthey are to be asserted or denied, but only upon the second being\\r\\ninferable from the first. such propositions, therefore, have a form\\r\\nwhich is different from that of any atomic proposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch propositions are important to logic, because all inference depends\\r\\nupon them. if i have told you that if it rains i shall bring my\\r\\numbrella, and if you see that there is a steady downpour, you can infer\\r\\nthat i shall bring my umbrella. there can be no inference except where\\r\\npropositions are connected in some such way, so that from the truth or\\r\\nfalsehood of the one something follows as to the truth or falsehood of\\r\\nthe other. it seems to be the case that we can sometimes know molecular\\r\\npropositions, as in the above instance of the umbrella, when we do not\\r\\nknow whether the component atomic propositions are true or false. the\\r\\n_practical_ utility of inference rests upon this fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next kind of propositions we have to consider are _general_\\r\\npropositions, such as \"all men are mortal,\" \"all equilateral triangles\\r\\nare equiangular.\" and with these belong propositions in which the word\\r\\n\"some\" occurs, such as \"some men are philosophers\" or \"some philosophers\\r\\nare not wise.\" these are the denials of general propositions, namely (in\\r\\nthe above instances), of \"all men are non-philosophers\" and \"all\\r\\nphilosophers are wise.\" we will call propositions containing the word\\r\\n\"some\" _negative_ general propositions, and those containing the word\\r\\n\"all\" _positive_ general propositions. these propositions, it will be\\r\\nseen, begin to have the appearance of the propositions in logical\\r\\ntext-books. but their peculiarity and complexity are not known to the\\r\\ntext-books, and the problems which they raise are only discussed in the\\r\\nmost superficial manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we were discussing atomic facts, we saw that we should be able,\\r\\ntheoretically, to infer all other truths by logic if we knew all atomic\\r\\nfacts and also knew that there were no other atomic facts besides those\\r\\nwe knew. the knowledge that there are no other atomic facts is positive\\r\\ngeneral knowledge; it is the knowledge that \"all atomic facts are known\\r\\nto me,\" or at least \"all atomic facts are in this collection\"--however\\r\\nthe collection may be given. it is easy to see that general\\r\\npropositions, such as \"all men are mortal,\" cannot be known by inference\\r\\nfrom atomic facts alone. if we could know each individual man, and know\\r\\nthat he was mortal, that would not enable us to know that all men are\\r\\nmortal, unless we _knew_ that those were all the men there are, which is\\r\\na general proposition. if we knew every other existing thing throughout\\r\\nthe universe, and knew that each separate thing was not an immortal man,\\r\\nthat would not give us our result unless we _knew_ that we had explored\\r\\nthe whole universe, _i.e._ unless we knew \"all things belong to this\\r\\ncollection of things i have examined.\" thus general truths cannot be\\r\\ninferred from particular truths alone, but must, if they are to be\\r\\nknown, be either self-evident, or inferred from premisses of which at\\r\\nleast one is a general truth. but all _empirical_ evidence is of\\r\\n_particular_ truths. hence, if there is any knowledge of general truths\\r\\nat all, there must be _some_ knowledge of general truths which is\\r\\nindependent of empirical evidence, _i.e._ does not depend upon the data\\r\\nof sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above conclusion, of which we had an instance in the case of the\\r\\ninductive principle, is important, since it affords a refutation of the\\r\\nolder empiricists. they believed that all our knowledge is derived from\\r\\nthe senses and dependent upon them. we see that, if this view is to be\\r\\nmaintained, we must refuse to admit that we know any general\\r\\npropositions. it is perfectly possible logically that this should be the\\r\\ncase, but it does not appear to be so in fact, and indeed no one would\\r\\ndream of maintaining such a view except a theorist at the last\\r\\nextremity. we must therefore admit that there is general knowledge not\\r\\nderived from sense, and that some of this knowledge is not obtained by\\r\\ninference but is primitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch general knowledge is to be found in logic. whether there is any\\r\\nsuch knowledge not derived from logic, i do not know; but in logic, at\\r\\nany rate, we have such knowledge. it will be remembered that we excluded\\r\\nfrom pure logic such propositions as, \"socrates is a man, all men are\\r\\nmortal, therefore socrates is mortal,\" because socrates and _man_ and\\r\\n_mortal_ are empirical terms, only to be understood through particular\\r\\nexperience. the corresponding proposition in pure logic is: \"if anything\\r\\nhas a certain property, and whatever has this property has a certain\\r\\nother property, then the thing in question has the other property.\" this\\r\\nproposition is absolutely general: it applies to all things and all\\r\\nproperties. and it is quite self-evident. thus in such propositions of\\r\\npure logic we have the self-evident general propositions of which we\\r\\nwere in search.\\r\\n\\r\\na proposition such as, \"if socrates is a man, and all men are mortal,\\r\\nthen socrates is mortal,\" is true in virtue of its _form_ alone. its\\r\\ntruth, in this hypothetical form, does not depend upon whether socrates\\r\\nactually is a man, nor upon whether in fact all men are mortal; thus it\\r\\nis equally true when we substitute other terms for socrates and _man_\\r\\nand _mortal_. the general truth of which it is an instance is purely\\r\\nformal, and belongs to logic. since it does not mention any particular\\r\\nthing, or even any particular quality or relation, it is wholly\\r\\nindependent of the accidental facts of the existent world, and can be\\r\\nknown, theoretically, without any experience of particular things or\\r\\ntheir qualities and relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nlogic, we may say, consists of two parts. the first part investigates\\r\\nwhat propositions are and what forms they may have; this part enumerates\\r\\nthe different kinds of atomic propositions, of molecular propositions,\\r\\nof general propositions, and so on. the second part consists of certain\\r\\nsupremely general propositions, which assert the truth of all\\r\\npropositions of certain forms. this second part merges into pure\\r\\nmathematics, whose propositions all turn out, on analysis, to be such\\r\\ngeneral formal truths. the first part, which merely enumerates forms, is\\r\\nthe more difficult, and philosophically the more important; and it is\\r\\nthe recent progress in this first part, more than anything else, that\\r\\nhas rendered a truly scientific discussion of many philosophical\\r\\nproblems possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem of the nature of judgment or belief may be taken as an\\r\\nexample of a problem whose solution depends upon an adequate inventory\\r\\nof logical forms. we have already seen how the supposed universality of\\r\\nthe subject-predicate form made it impossible to give a right analysis\\r\\nof serial order, and therefore made space and time unintelligible. but\\r\\nin this case it was only necessary to admit relations of two terms. the\\r\\ncase of judgment demands the admission of more complicated forms. if all\\r\\njudgments were true, we might suppose that a judgment consisted in\\r\\napprehension of a _fact_, and that the apprehension was a relation of a\\r\\nmind to the fact. from poverty in the logical inventory, this view has\\r\\noften been held. but it leads to absolutely insoluble difficulties in\\r\\nthe case of error. suppose i believe that charles i. died in his bed.\\r\\nthere is no objective fact \"charles i.\\'s death in his bed\" to which i\\r\\ncan have a relation of apprehension. charles i. and death and his bed\\r\\nare objective, but they are not, except in my thought, put together as\\r\\nmy false belief supposes. it is therefore necessary, in analysing a\\r\\nbelief, to look for some other logical form than a two-term relation.\\r\\nfailure to realise this necessity has, in my opinion, vitiated almost\\r\\neverything that has hitherto been written on the theory of knowledge,\\r\\nmaking the problem of error insoluble and the difference between belief\\r\\nand perception inexplicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nmodern logic, as i hope is now evident, has the effect of enlarging our\\r\\nabstract imagination, and providing an infinite number of possible\\r\\nhypotheses to be applied in the analysis of any complex fact. in this\\r\\nrespect it is the exact opposite of the logic practised by the classical\\r\\ntradition. in that logic, hypotheses which seem _prima facie_ possible\\r\\nare professedly proved impossible, and it is decreed in advance that\\r\\nreality must have a certain special character. in modern logic, on the\\r\\ncontrary, while the _prima facie_ hypotheses as a rule remain\\r\\nadmissible, others, which only logic would have suggested, are added to\\r\\nour stock, and are very often found to be indispensable if a right\\r\\nanalysis of the facts is to be obtained. the old logic put thought in\\r\\nfetters, while the new logic gives it wings. it has, in my opinion,\\r\\nintroduced the same kind of advance into philosophy as galileo\\r\\nintroduced into physics, making it possible at last to see what kinds of\\r\\nproblems may be capable of solution, and what kinds must be abandoned as\\r\\nbeyond human powers. and where a solution appears possible, the new\\r\\nlogic provides a method which enables us to obtain results that do not\\r\\nmerely embody personal idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of\\r\\nall who are competent to form an opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture iii\\r\\n\\r\\non our knowledge of the external world\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy may be approached by many roads, but one of the oldest and\\r\\nmost travelled is the road which leads through doubt as to the reality\\r\\nof the world of sense. in indian mysticism, in greek and modern monistic\\r\\nphilosophy from parmenides onward, in berkeley, in modern physics, we\\r\\nfind sensible appearance criticised and condemned for a bewildering\\r\\nvariety of motives. the mystic condemns it on the ground of immediate\\r\\nknowledge of a more real and significant world behind the veil;\\r\\nparmenides and plato condemn it because its continual flux is thought\\r\\ninconsistent with the unchanging nature of the abstract entities\\r\\nrevealed by logical analysis; berkeley brings several weapons, but his\\r\\nchief is the subjectivity of sense-data, their dependence upon the\\r\\norganisation and point of view of the spectator; while modern physics,\\r\\non the basis of sensible evidence itself, maintains a mad dance of\\r\\nelectrons which has, superficially at least, very little resemblance to\\r\\nthe immediate objects of sight or touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nevery one of these lines of attack raises vital and interesting\\r\\nproblems.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mystic, so long as he merely reports a positive revelation, cannot\\r\\nbe refuted; but when he _denies_ reality to objects of sense, he may be\\r\\nquestioned as to what he means by \"reality,\" and may be asked how their\\r\\nunreality follows from the supposed reality of his super-sensible world.\\r\\nin answering these questions, he is led to a logic which merges into\\r\\nthat of parmenides and plato and the idealist tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logic of the idealist tradition has gradually grown very complex and\\r\\nvery abstruse, as may be seen from the bradleian sample considered in\\r\\nour first lecture. if we attempted to deal fully with this logic, we\\r\\nshould not have time to reach any other aspect of our subject; we will\\r\\ntherefore, while acknowledging that it deserves a long discussion, pass\\r\\nby its central doctrines with only such occasional criticism as may\\r\\nserve to exemplify other topics, and concentrate our attention on such\\r\\nmatters as its objections to the continuity of motion and the infinity\\r\\nof space and time--objections which have been fully answered by modern\\r\\nmathematicians in a manner constituting an abiding triumph for the\\r\\nmethod of logical analysis in philosophy. these objections and the\\r\\nmodern answers to them will occupy our fifth, sixth, and seventh\\r\\nlectures.\\r\\n\\r\\nberkeley\\'s attack, as reinforced by the physiology of the sense-organs\\r\\nand nerves and brain, is very powerful. i think it must be admitted as\\r\\nprobable that the immediate objects of sense depend for their existence\\r\\nupon physiological conditions in ourselves, and that, for example, the\\r\\ncoloured surfaces which we see cease to exist when we shut our eyes. but\\r\\nit would be a mistake to infer that they are dependent upon mind, not\\r\\nreal while we see them, or not the sole basis for our knowledge of the\\r\\nexternal world. this line of argument will be developed in the present\\r\\nlecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe discrepancy between the world of physics and the world of sense,\\r\\nwhich we shall consider in our fourth lecture, will be found to be more\\r\\napparent than real, and it will be shown that whatever there is reason\\r\\nto believe in physics can probably be interpreted in terms of sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe instrument of discovery throughout is modern logic, a very different\\r\\nscience from the logic of the text-books and also from the logic of\\r\\nidealism. our second lecture has given a short account of modern logic\\r\\nand of its points of divergence from the various traditional kinds of\\r\\nlogic.\\r\\n\\r\\nin our last lecture, after a discussion of causality and free will, we\\r\\nshall try to reach a general account of the logical-analytic method of\\r\\nscientific philosophy, and a tentative estimate of the hopes of\\r\\nphilosophical progress which it allows us to entertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this lecture, i wish to apply the logical-analytic method to one of\\r\\nthe oldest problems of philosophy, namely, the problem of our knowledge\\r\\nof the external world. what i have to say on this problem does not\\r\\namount to an answer of a definite and dogmatic kind; it amounts only to\\r\\nan analysis and statement of the questions involved, with an indication\\r\\nof the directions in which evidence may be sought. but although not yet\\r\\na definite solution, what can be said at present seems to me to throw a\\r\\ncompletely new light on the problem, and to be indispensable, not only\\r\\nin seeking the answer, but also in the preliminary question as to what\\r\\nparts of our problem may possibly have an ascertainable answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nin every philosophical problem, our investigation starts from what may\\r\\nbe called \"data,\" by which i mean matters of common knowledge, vague,\\r\\ncomplex, inexact, as common knowledge always is, but yet somehow\\r\\ncommanding our assent as on the whole and in some interpretation pretty\\r\\ncertainly true. in the case of our present problem, the common knowledge\\r\\ninvolved is of various kinds. there is first our acquaintance with\\r\\nparticular objects of daily life--furniture, houses, towns, other\\r\\npeople, and so on. then there is the extension of such particular\\r\\nknowledge to particular things outside our personal experience, through\\r\\nhistory and geography, newspapers, etc. and lastly, there is the\\r\\nsystematisation of all this knowledge of particulars by means of\\r\\nphysical science, which derives immense persuasive force from its\\r\\nastonishing power of foretelling the future. we are quite willing to\\r\\nadmit that there may be errors of detail in this knowledge, but we\\r\\nbelieve them to be discoverable and corrigible by the methods which have\\r\\ngiven rise to our beliefs, and we do not, as practical men, entertain\\r\\nfor a moment the hypothesis that the whole edifice may be built on\\r\\ninsecure foundations. in the main, therefore, and without absolute\\r\\ndogmatism as to this or that special portion, we may accept this mass of\\r\\ncommon knowledge as affording data for our philosophical analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be said--and this is an objection which must be met at the\\r\\noutset--that it is the duty of the philosopher to call in question the\\r\\nadmittedly fallible beliefs of daily life, and to replace them by\\r\\nsomething more solid and irrefragable. in a sense this is true, and in a\\r\\nsense it is effected in the course of analysis. but in another sense,\\r\\nand a very important one, it is quite impossible. while admitting that\\r\\ndoubt is possible with regard to all our common knowledge, we must\\r\\nnevertheless accept that knowledge in the main if philosophy is to be\\r\\npossible at all. there is not any superfine brand of knowledge,\\r\\nobtainable by the philosopher, which can give us a standpoint from which\\r\\nto criticise the whole of the knowledge of daily life. the most that can\\r\\nbe done is to examine and purify our common knowledge by an internal\\r\\nscrutiny, assuming the canons by which it has been obtained, and\\r\\napplying them with more care and with more precision. philosophy cannot\\r\\nboast of having achieved such a degree of certainty that it can have\\r\\nauthority to condemn the facts of experience and the laws of science.\\r\\nthe philosophic scrutiny, therefore, though sceptical in regard to every\\r\\ndetail, is not sceptical as regards the whole. that is to say, its\\r\\ncriticism of details will only be based upon their relation to other\\r\\ndetails, not upon some external criterion which can be applied to all\\r\\nthe details equally. the reason for this abstention from a universal\\r\\ncriticism is not any dogmatic confidence, but its exact opposite; it is\\r\\nnot that common knowledge _must_ be true, but that we possess no\\r\\nradically different kind of knowledge derived from some other source.\\r\\nuniversal scepticism, though logically irrefutable, is practically\\r\\nbarren; it can only, therefore, give a certain flavour of hesitancy to\\r\\nour beliefs, and cannot be used to substitute other beliefs for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough data can only be criticised by other data, not by an outside\\r\\nstandard, yet we may distinguish different grades of certainty in the\\r\\ndifferent kinds of common knowledge which we enumerated just now. what\\r\\ndoes not go beyond our own personal sensible acquaintance must be for us\\r\\nthe most certain: the \"evidence of the senses\" is proverbially the least\\r\\nopen to question. what depends on testimony, like the facts of history\\r\\nand geography which are learnt from books, has varying degrees of\\r\\ncertainty according to the nature and extent of the testimony. doubts as\\r\\nto the existence of napoleon can only be maintained for a joke, whereas\\r\\nthe historicity of agamemnon is a legitimate subject of debate. in\\r\\nscience, again, we find all grades of certainty short of the highest.\\r\\nthe law of gravitation, at least as an approximate truth, has acquired\\r\\nby this time the same kind of certainty as the existence of napoleon,\\r\\nwhereas the latest speculations concerning the constitution of matter\\r\\nwould be universally acknowledged to have as yet only a rather slight\\r\\nprobability in their favour. these varying degrees of certainty\\r\\nattaching to different data may be regarded as themselves forming part\\r\\nof our data; they, along with the other data, lie within the vague,\\r\\ncomplex, inexact body of knowledge which it is the business of the\\r\\nphilosopher to analyse.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing that appears when we begin to analyse our common\\r\\nknowledge is that some of it is derivative, while some is primitive;\\r\\nthat is to say, there is some that we only believe because of something\\r\\nelse from which it has been inferred in some sense, though not\\r\\nnecessarily in a strict logical sense, while other parts are believed on\\r\\ntheir own account, without the support of any outside evidence. it is\\r\\nobvious that the senses give knowledge of the latter kind: the immediate\\r\\nfacts perceived by sight or touch or hearing do not need to be proved by\\r\\nargument, but are completely self-evident. psychologists, however, have\\r\\nmade us aware that what is actually given in sense is much less than\\r\\nmost people would naturally suppose, and that much of what at first\\r\\nsight seems to be given is really inferred. this applies especially in\\r\\nregard to our space-perceptions. for instance, we instinctively infer\\r\\nthe \"real\" size and shape of a visible object from its apparent size and\\r\\nshape, according to its distance and our point of view. when we hear a\\r\\nperson speaking, our actual sensations usually miss a great deal of what\\r\\nhe says, and we supply its place by unconscious inference; in a foreign\\r\\nlanguage, where this process is more difficult, we find ourselves\\r\\napparently grown deaf, requiring, for example, to be much nearer the\\r\\nstage at a theatre than would be necessary in our own country. thus the\\r\\nfirst step in the analysis of data, namely, the discovery of what is\\r\\nreally given in sense, is full of difficulty. we will, however, not\\r\\nlinger on this point; so long as its existence is realised, the exact\\r\\noutcome does not make any very great difference in our main problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next step in our analysis must be the consideration of how the\\r\\nderivative parts of our common knowledge arise. here we become involved\\r\\nin a somewhat puzzling entanglement of logic and psychology.\\r\\npsychologically, a belief may be called derivative whenever it is caused\\r\\nby one or more other beliefs, or by some fact of sense which is not\\r\\nsimply what the belief asserts. derivative beliefs in this sense\\r\\nconstantly arise without any process of logical inference, merely by\\r\\nassociation of ideas or some equally extra-logical process. from the\\r\\nexpression of a man\\'s face we judge as to what he is feeling: we say we\\r\\n_see_ that he is angry, when in fact we only see a frown. we do not\\r\\njudge as to his state of mind by any logical process: the judgment grows\\r\\nup, often without our being able to say what physical mark of emotion we\\r\\nactually saw. in such a case, the knowledge is derivative\\r\\npsychologically; but logically it is in a sense primitive, since it is\\r\\nnot the result of any logical deduction. there may or may not be a\\r\\npossible deduction leading to the same result, but whether there is or\\r\\nnot, we certainly do not employ it. if we call a belief \"logically\\r\\nprimitive\" when it is not actually arrived at by a logical inference,\\r\\nthen innumerable beliefs are logically primitive which psychologically\\r\\nare derivative. the separation of these two kinds of primitiveness is\\r\\nvitally important to our present discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we reflect upon the beliefs which are logically but not\\r\\npsychologically primitive, we find that, unless they can on reflection\\r\\nbe deduced by a logical process from beliefs which are also\\r\\npsychologically primitive, our confidence in their truth tends to\\r\\ndiminish the more we think about them. we naturally believe, for\\r\\nexample, that tables and chairs, trees and mountains, are still there\\r\\nwhen we turn our backs upon them. i do not wish for a moment to maintain\\r\\nthat this is certainly not the case, but i do maintain that the question\\r\\nwhether it is the case is not to be settled off-hand on any supposed\\r\\nground of obviousness. the belief that they persist is, in all men\\r\\nexcept a few philosophers, logically primitive, but it is not\\r\\npsychologically primitive; psychologically, it arises only through our\\r\\nhaving seen those tables and chairs, trees and mountains. as soon as the\\r\\nquestion is seriously raised whether, because we have seen them, we have\\r\\na right to suppose that they are there still, we feel that some kind of\\r\\nargument must be produced, and that if none is forthcoming, our belief\\r\\ncan be no more than a pious opinion. we do not feel this as regards the\\r\\nimmediate objects of sense: there they are, and as far as their\\r\\nmomentary existence is concerned, no further argument is required. there\\r\\nis accordingly more need of justifying our psychologically derivative\\r\\nbeliefs than of justifying those that are primitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are thus led to a somewhat vague distinction between what we may call\\r\\n\"hard\" data and \"soft\" data. this distinction is a matter of degree, and\\r\\nmust not be pressed; but if not taken too seriously it may help to make\\r\\nthe situation clear. i mean by \"hard\" data those which resist the\\r\\nsolvent influence of critical reflection, and by \"soft\" data those\\r\\nwhich, under the operation of this process, become to our minds more or\\r\\nless doubtful. the hardest of hard data are of two sorts: the particular\\r\\nfacts of sense, and the general truths of logic. the more we reflect\\r\\nupon these, the more we realise exactly what they are, and exactly what\\r\\na doubt concerning them really means, the more luminously certain do\\r\\nthey become. _verbal_ doubt concerning even these is possible, but\\r\\nverbal doubt may occur when what is nominally being doubted is not\\r\\nreally in our thoughts, and only words are actually present to our\\r\\nminds. real doubt, in these two cases, would, i think, be pathological.\\r\\nat any rate, to me they seem quite certain, and i shall assume that you\\r\\nagree with me in this. without this assumption, we are in danger of\\r\\nfalling into that universal scepticism which, as we saw, is as barren as\\r\\nit is irrefutable. if we are to continue philosophising, we must make\\r\\nour bow to the sceptical hypothesis, and, while admitting the elegant\\r\\nterseness of its philosophy, proceed to the consideration of other\\r\\nhypotheses which, though perhaps not certain, have at least as good a\\r\\nright to our respect as the hypothesis of the sceptic.\\r\\n\\r\\napplying our distinction of \"hard\" and \"soft\" data to psychologically\\r\\nderivative but logically primitive beliefs, we shall find that most, if\\r\\nnot all, are to be classed as soft data. they may be found, on\\r\\nreflection, to be capable of logical proof, and they then again become\\r\\nbelieved, but no longer as data. as data, though entitled to a certain\\r\\nlimited respect, they cannot be placed on a level with the facts of\\r\\nsense or the laws of logic. the kind of respect which they deserve seems\\r\\nto me such as to warrant us in hoping, though not too confidently, that\\r\\nthe hard data may prove them to be at least probable. also, if the hard\\r\\ndata are found to throw no light whatever upon their truth or falsehood,\\r\\nwe are justified, i think, in giving rather more weight to the\\r\\nhypothesis of their truth than to the hypothesis of their falsehood. for\\r\\nthe present, however, let us confine ourselves to the hard data, with a\\r\\nview to discovering what sort of world can be constructed by their means\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n\\r\\nour data now are primarily the facts of sense (_i.e._ of _our own_\\r\\nsense-data) and the laws of logic. but even the severest scrutiny will\\r\\nallow some additions to this slender stock. some facts of\\r\\nmemory--especially of recent memory--seem to have the highest degree of\\r\\ncertainty. some introspective facts are as certain as any facts of\\r\\nsense. and facts of sense themselves must, for our present purposes, be\\r\\ninterpreted with a certain latitude. spatial and temporal relations must\\r\\nsometimes be included, for example in the case of a swift motion falling\\r\\nwholly within the specious present. and some facts of comparison, such\\r\\nas the likeness or unlikeness of two shades of colour, are certainly to\\r\\nbe included among hard data. also we must remember that the distinction\\r\\nof hard and soft data is psychological and subjective, so that, if there\\r\\nare other minds than our own--which at our present stage must be held\\r\\ndoubtful--the catalogue of hard data may be different for them from what\\r\\nit is for us.\\r\\n\\r\\ncertain common beliefs are undoubtedly excluded from hard data. such is\\r\\nthe belief which led us to introduce the distinction, namely, that\\r\\nsensible objects in general persist when we are not perceiving them.\\r\\nsuch also is the belief in other people\\'s minds: this belief is\\r\\nobviously derivative from our perception of their bodies, and is felt to\\r\\ndemand logical justification as soon as we become aware of its\\r\\nderivativeness. belief in what is reported by the testimony of others,\\r\\nincluding all that we learn from books, is of course involved in the\\r\\ndoubt as to whether other people have minds at all. thus the world from\\r\\nwhich our reconstruction is to begin is very fragmentary. the best we\\r\\ncan say for it is that it is slightly more extensive than the world at\\r\\nwhich descartes arrived by a similar process, since that world contained\\r\\nnothing except himself and his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are now in a position to understand and state the problem of our\\r\\nknowledge of the external world, and to remove various misunderstandings\\r\\nwhich have obscured the meaning of the problem. the problem really is:\\r\\ncan the existence of anything other than our own hard data be inferred\\r\\nfrom the existence of those data? but before considering this problem,\\r\\nlet us briefly consider what the problem is _not_.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we speak of the \"external\" world in this discussion, we must not\\r\\nmean \"spatially external,\" unless \"space\" is interpreted in a peculiar\\r\\nand recondite manner. the immediate objects of sight, the coloured\\r\\nsurfaces which make up the visible world, are spatially external in the\\r\\nnatural meaning of this phrase. we feel them to be \"there\" as opposed to\\r\\n\"here\"; without making any assumption of an existence other than hard\\r\\ndata, we can more or less estimate the distance of a coloured surface.\\r\\nit seems probable that distances, provided they are not too great, are\\r\\nactually given more or less roughly in sight; but whether this is the\\r\\ncase or not, ordinary distances can certainly be estimated approximately\\r\\nby means of the data of sense alone. the immediately given world is\\r\\nspatial, and is further not wholly contained within our own bodies. thus\\r\\nour knowledge of what is external in this sense is not open to doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother form in which the question is often put is: \"can we know of the\\r\\nexistence of any reality which is independent of ourselves?\" this form\\r\\nof the question suffers from the ambiguity of the two words\\r\\n\"independent\" and \"self.\" to take the self first: the question as to\\r\\nwhat is to be reckoned part of the self and what is not, is a very\\r\\ndifficult one. among many other things which we may mean by the self,\\r\\ntwo may be selected as specially important, namely, (1) the bare subject\\r\\nwhich thinks and is aware of objects, (2) the whole assemblage of things\\r\\nthat would necessarily cease to exist if our lives came to an end. the\\r\\nbare subject, if it exists at all, is an inference, and is not part of\\r\\nthe data; therefore this meaning of self may be ignored in our present\\r\\ninquiry. the second meaning is difficult to make precise, since we\\r\\nhardly know what things depend upon our lives for their existence. and\\r\\nin this form, the definition of self introduces the word \"depend,\" which\\r\\nraises the same questions as are raised by the word \"independent.\" let\\r\\nus therefore take up the word \"independent,\" and return to the self\\r\\nlater.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we say that one thing is \"independent\" of another, we may mean\\r\\neither that it is logically possible for the one to exist without the\\r\\nother, or that there is no causal relation between the two such that the\\r\\none only occurs as the effect of the other. the only way, so far as i\\r\\nknow, in which one thing can be _logically_ dependent upon another is\\r\\nwhen the other is _part_ of the one. the existence of a book, for\\r\\nexample, is logically dependent upon that of its pages: without the\\r\\npages there would be no book. thus in this sense the question, \"can we\\r\\nknow of the existence of any reality which is independent of ourselves?\"\\r\\nreduces to the question, \"can we know of the existence of any reality of\\r\\nwhich our self is not part?\" in this form, the question brings us back\\r\\nto the problem of defining the self; but i think, however the self may\\r\\nbe defined, even when it is taken as the bare subject, it cannot be\\r\\nsupposed to be part of the immediate object of sense; thus in this form\\r\\nof the question we must admit that we can know of the existence of\\r\\nrealities independent of ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question of causal dependence is much more difficult. to know that\\r\\none kind of thing is causally independent of another, we must know that\\r\\nit actually occurs without the other. now it is fairly obvious that,\\r\\nwhatever legitimate meaning we give to the self, our thoughts and\\r\\nfeelings are causally dependent upon ourselves, _i.e._ do not occur when\\r\\nthere is no self for them to belong to. but in the case of objects of\\r\\nsense this is not obvious; indeed, as we saw, the common-sense view is\\r\\nthat such objects persist in the absence of any percipient. if this is\\r\\nthe case, then they are causally independent of ourselves; if not, not.\\r\\nthus in this form the question reduces to the question whether we can\\r\\nknow that objects of sense, or any other objects not our own thoughts\\r\\nand feelings, exist at times when we are not perceiving them. this form,\\r\\nin which the difficult word \"independent\" no longer occurs, is the form\\r\\nin which we stated the problem a minute ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nour question in the above form raises two distinct problems, which it is\\r\\nimportant to keep separate. first, can we know that objects of sense, or\\r\\nvery similar objects, exist at times when we are not perceiving them?\\r\\nsecondly, if this cannot be known, can we know that other objects,\\r\\ninferable from objects of sense but not necessarily resembling them,\\r\\nexist either when we are perceiving the objects of sense or at any other\\r\\ntime? this latter problem arises in philosophy as the problem of the\\r\\n\"thing in itself,\" and in science as the problem of matter as assumed in\\r\\nphysics. we will consider this latter problem first.\\r\\n\\r\\nowing to the fact that we feel passive in sensation, we naturally\\r\\nsuppose that our sensations have outside causes. now it is necessary\\r\\nhere first of all to distinguish between (1) our sensation, which is a\\r\\nmental event consisting in our being aware of a sensible object, and (2)\\r\\nthe sensible object of which we are aware in sensation. when i speak of\\r\\nthe sensible object, it must be understood that i do not mean such a\\r\\nthing as a table, which is both visible and tangible, can be seen by\\r\\nmany people at once, and is more or less permanent. what i mean is just\\r\\nthat patch of colour which is momentarily seen when we look at the\\r\\ntable, or just that particular hardness which is felt when we press it,\\r\\nor just that particular sound which is heard when we rap it. each of\\r\\nthese i call a sensible object, and our awareness of it i call a\\r\\nsensation. now our sense of passivity, if it really afforded any\\r\\nargument, would only tend to show that the _sensation_ has an outside\\r\\ncause; this cause we should naturally seek in the sensible object. thus\\r\\nthere is no good reason, so far, for supposing that sensible objects\\r\\nmust have outside causes. but both the thing-in-itself of philosophy and\\r\\nthe matter of physics present themselves as outside causes of the\\r\\nsensible object as much as of the sensation. what are the grounds for\\r\\nthis common opinion?\\r\\n\\r\\nin each case, i think, the opinion has resulted from the combination of\\r\\na belief that _something_ which can persist independently of our\\r\\nconsciousness makes itself known in sensation, with the fact that our\\r\\nsensations often change in ways which seem to depend upon us rather than\\r\\nupon anything which would be supposed to persist independently of us. at\\r\\nfirst, we believe unreflectingly that everything is as it seems to be,\\r\\nand that, if we shut our eyes, the objects we had been seeing remain as\\r\\nthey were though we no longer see them. but there are arguments against\\r\\nthis view, which have generally been thought conclusive. it is\\r\\nextraordinarily difficult to see just what the arguments prove; but if\\r\\nwe are to make any progress with the problem of the external world, we\\r\\nmust try to make up our minds as to these arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\na table viewed from one place presents a different appearance from that\\r\\nwhich it presents from another place. this is the language of common\\r\\nsense, but this language already assumes that there is a real table of\\r\\nwhich we see the appearances. let us try to state what is known in terms\\r\\nof sensible objects alone, without any element of hypothesis. we find\\r\\nthat as we walk round the table, we perceive a series of gradually\\r\\nchanging visible objects. but in speaking of \"walking round the table,\"\\r\\nwe have still retained the hypothesis that there is a single table\\r\\nconnected with all the appearances. what we ought to say is that, while\\r\\nwe have those muscular and other sensations which make us say we are\\r\\nwalking, our visual sensations change in a continuous way, so that, for\\r\\nexample, a striking patch of colour is not suddenly replaced by\\r\\nsomething wholly different, but is replaced by an insensible gradation\\r\\nof slightly different colours with slightly different shapes. this is\\r\\nwhat we really know by experience, when we have freed our minds from the\\r\\nassumption of permanent \"things\" with changing appearances. what is\\r\\nreally known is a correlation of muscular and other bodily sensations\\r\\nwith changes in visual sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut walking round the table is not the only way of altering its\\r\\nappearance. we can shut one eye, or put on blue spectacles, or look\\r\\nthrough a microscope. all these operations, in various ways, alter the\\r\\nvisual appearance which we call that of the table. more distant objects\\r\\nwill also alter their appearance if (as we say) the state of the\\r\\natmosphere changes--if there is fog or rain or sunshine. physiological\\r\\nchanges also alter the appearances of things. if we assume the world of\\r\\ncommon sense, all these changes, including those attributed to\\r\\nphysiological causes, are changes in the intervening medium. it is not\\r\\nquite so easy as in the former case to reduce this set of facts to a\\r\\nform in which nothing is assumed beyond sensible objects. anything\\r\\nintervening between ourselves and what we see must be invisible: our\\r\\nview in every direction is bounded by the nearest visible object. it\\r\\nmight be objected that a dirty pane of glass, for example, is visible\\r\\nalthough we can see things through it. but in this case we really see a\\r\\nspotted patchwork: the dirtier specks in the glass are visible, while\\r\\nthe cleaner parts are invisible and allow us to see what is beyond. thus\\r\\nthe discovery that the intervening medium affects the appearances of\\r\\nthings cannot be made by means of the sense of sight alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take the case of the blue spectacles, which is the simplest, but\\r\\nmay serve as a type for the others. the frame of the spectacles is of\\r\\ncourse visible, but the blue glass, if it is clean, is not visible. the\\r\\nblueness, which we say is in the glass, appears as being in the objects\\r\\nseen through the glass. the glass itself is known by means of the sense\\r\\nof touch. in order to know that it is between us and the objects seen\\r\\nthrough it, we must know how to correlate the space of touch with the\\r\\nspace of sight. this correlation itself, when stated in terms of the\\r\\ndata of sense alone, is by no means a simple matter. but it presents no\\r\\ndifficulties of principle, and may therefore be supposed accomplished.\\r\\nwhen it has been accomplished, it becomes possible to attach a meaning\\r\\nto the statement that the blue glass, which we can touch, is between us\\r\\nand the object seen, as we say, \"through\" it.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut we have still not reduced our statement completely to what is\\r\\nactually given in sense. we have fallen into the assumption that the\\r\\nobject of which we are conscious when we touch the blue spectacles still\\r\\nexists after we have ceased to touch them. so long as we are touching\\r\\nthem, nothing except our finger can be seen through the part touched,\\r\\nwhich is the only part where we immediately know that there is\\r\\nsomething. if we are to account for the blue appearance of objects other\\r\\nthan the spectacles, when seen through them, it might seem as if we must\\r\\nassume that the spectacles still exist when we are not touching them;\\r\\nand if this assumption really is necessary, our main problem is\\r\\nanswered: we have means of knowing of the present existence of objects\\r\\nnot given in sense, though of the same kind as objects formerly given in\\r\\nsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be questioned, however, whether this assumption is actually\\r\\nunavoidable, though it is unquestionably the most natural one to make.\\r\\nwe may say that the object of which we become aware when we touch the\\r\\nspectacles continues to have effects afterwards, though perhaps it no\\r\\nlonger exists. in this view, the supposed continued existence of\\r\\nsensible objects after they have ceased to be sensible will be a\\r\\nfallacious inference from the fact that they still have effects. it is\\r\\noften supposed that nothing which has ceased to exist can continue to\\r\\nhave effects, but this is a mere prejudice, due to a wrong conception of\\r\\ncausality. we cannot, therefore, dismiss our present hypothesis on the\\r\\nground of _a priori_ impossibility, but must examine further whether it\\r\\ncan really account for the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be said that our hypothesis is useless in the case when the blue\\r\\nglass is never touched at all. how, in that case, are we to account for\\r\\nthe blue appearance of objects? and more generally, what are we to make\\r\\nof the hypothetical sensations of touch which we associate with\\r\\nuntouched visible objects, which we know would be verified if we chose,\\r\\nthough in fact we do not verify them? must not these be attributed to\\r\\npermanent possession, by the objects, of the properties which touch\\r\\nwould reveal?\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us consider the more general question first. experience has taught\\r\\nus that where we see certain kinds of coloured surfaces we can, by\\r\\ntouch, obtain certain expected sensations of hardness or softness,\\r\\ntactile shape, and so on. this leads us to believe that what is seen is\\r\\nusually tangible, and that it has, whether we touch it or not, the\\r\\nhardness or softness which we should expect to feel if we touched it.\\r\\nbut the mere fact that we are able to infer what our tactile sensations\\r\\nwould be shows that it is not logically necessary to assume tactile\\r\\nqualities before they are felt. all that is really known is that the\\r\\nvisual appearance in question, together with touch, will lead to certain\\r\\nsensations, which can necessarily be determined in terms of the visual\\r\\nappearance, since otherwise they could not be inferred from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now give a statement of the experienced facts concerning the blue\\r\\nspectacles, which will supply an interpretation of common-sense beliefs\\r\\nwithout assuming anything beyond the existence of sensible objects at\\r\\nthe times when they are sensible. by experience of the correlation of\\r\\ntouch and sight sensations, we become able to associate a certain place\\r\\nin touch-space with a certain corresponding place in sight-space.\\r\\nsometimes, namely in the case of transparent things, we find that there\\r\\nis a tangible object in a touch-place without there being any visible\\r\\nobject in the corresponding sight-place. but in such a case as that of\\r\\nthe blue spectacles, we find that whatever object is visible beyond the\\r\\nempty sight-place in the same line of sight has a different colour from\\r\\nwhat it has when there is no tangible object in the intervening\\r\\ntouch-place; and as we move the tangible object in touch-space, the blue\\r\\npatch moves in sight-space. if now we find a blue patch moving in this\\r\\nway in sight-space, when we have no sensible experience of an\\r\\nintervening tangible object, we nevertheless infer that, if we put our\\r\\nhand at a certain place in touch-space, we should experience a certain\\r\\ntouch-sensation. if we are to avoid non-sensible objects, this must be\\r\\ntaken as the whole of our meaning when we say that the blue spectacles\\r\\nare in a certain place, though we have not touched them, and have only\\r\\nseen other things rendered blue by their interposition.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think it may be laid down quite generally that, _in so far_ as physics\\r\\nor common sense is verifiable, it must be capable of interpretation in\\r\\nterms of actual sense-data alone. the reason for this is simple.\\r\\nverification consists always in the occurrence of an expected\\r\\nsense-datum. astronomers tell us there will be an eclipse of the moon:\\r\\nwe look at the moon, and find the earth\\'s shadow biting into it, that is\\r\\nto say, we see an appearance quite different from that of the usual full\\r\\nmoon. now if an expected sense-datum constitutes a verification, what\\r\\nwas asserted must have been about sense-data; or, at any rate, if part\\r\\nof what was asserted was not about sense-data, then only the other part\\r\\nhas been verified. there is in fact a certain regularity or conformity\\r\\nto law about the occurrence of sense-data, but the sense-data that occur\\r\\nat one time are often causally connected with those that occur at quite\\r\\nother times, and not, or at least not very closely, with those that\\r\\noccur at neighbouring times. if i look at the moon and immediately\\r\\nafterwards hear a train coming, there is no very close causal connection\\r\\nbetween my two sense-data; but if i look at the moon on two nights a\\r\\nweek apart, there is a very close causal connection between the two\\r\\nsense-data. the simplest, or at least the easiest, statement of the\\r\\nconnection is obtained by imagining a \"real\" moon which goes on whether\\r\\ni look at it or not, providing a series of _possible_ sense-data of\\r\\nwhich only those are actual which belong to moments when i choose to\\r\\nlook at the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the degree of verification obtainable in this way is very small. it\\r\\nmust be remembered that, at our present level of doubt, we are not at\\r\\nliberty to accept testimony. when we hear certain noises, which are\\r\\nthose we should utter if we wished to express a certain thought, we\\r\\nassume that that thought, or one very like it, has been in another mind,\\r\\nand has given rise to the expression which we hear. if at the same time\\r\\nwe see a body resembling our own, moving its lips as we move ours when\\r\\nwe speak, we cannot resist the belief that it is alive, and that the\\r\\nfeelings inside it continue when we are not looking at it. when we see\\r\\nour friend drop a weight upon his toe, and hear him say--what we should\\r\\nsay in similar circumstances, the phenomena _can_ no doubt be explained\\r\\nwithout assuming that he is anything but a series of shapes and noises\\r\\nseen and heard by us, but practically no man is so infected with\\r\\nphilosophy as not to be quite certain that his friend has felt the same\\r\\nkind of pain as he himself would feel. we will consider the legitimacy\\r\\nof this belief presently; for the moment, i only wish to point out that\\r\\nit needs the same kind of justification as our belief that the moon\\r\\nexists when we do not see it, and that, without it, testimony heard or\\r\\nread is reduced to noises and shapes, and cannot be regarded as evidence\\r\\nof the facts which it reports. the verification of physics which is\\r\\npossible at our present level is, therefore, only that degree of\\r\\nverification which is possible by one man\\'s unaided observations, which\\r\\nwill not carry us very far towards the establishment of a whole science.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore proceeding further, let us summarise the argument so far as it\\r\\nhas gone. the problem is: \"can the existence of anything other than our\\r\\nown hard data be inferred from these data?\" it is a mistake to state the\\r\\nproblem in the form: \"can we know of the existence of anything other\\r\\nthan ourselves and our states?\" or: \"can we know of the existence of\\r\\nanything independent of ourselves?\" because of the extreme difficulty of\\r\\ndefining \"self\" and \"independent\" precisely. the felt passivity of\\r\\nsensation is irrelevant, since, even if it proved anything, it could\\r\\nonly prove that sensations are caused by sensible objects. the natural\\r\\n_naive_ belief is that things seen persist, when unseen, exactly or\\r\\napproximately as they appeared when seen; but this belief tends to be\\r\\ndispelled by the fact that what common sense regards as the appearance\\r\\nof one object changes with what common sense regards as changes in the\\r\\npoint of view and in the intervening medium, including in the latter our\\r\\nown sense-organs and nerves and brain. this fact, as just stated,\\r\\nassumes, however, the common-sense world of stable objects which it\\r\\nprofesses to call in question; hence, before we can discover its precise\\r\\nbearing on our problem, we must find a way of stating it which does not\\r\\ninvolve any of the assumptions which it is designed to render doubtful.\\r\\nwhat we then find, as the bare outcome of experience, is that gradual\\r\\nchanges in certain sense-data are correlated with gradual changes in\\r\\ncertain others, or (in the case of bodily motions) with the other\\r\\nsense-data themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe assumption that sensible objects persist after they have ceased to\\r\\nbe sensible--for example, that the hardness of a visible body, which has\\r\\nbeen discovered by touch, continues when the body is no longer\\r\\ntouched--may be replaced by the statement that the _effects_ of sensible\\r\\nobjects persist, _i.e._ that what happens now can only be accounted for,\\r\\nin many cases, by taking account of what happened at an earlier time.\\r\\neverything that one man, by his own personal experience, can verify in\\r\\nthe account of the world given by common sense and physics, will be\\r\\nexplicable by some such means, since verification consists merely in the\\r\\noccurrence of an expected sense-datum. but what depends upon testimony,\\r\\nwhether heard or read, cannot be explained in this way, since testimony\\r\\ndepends upon the existence of minds other than our own, and thus\\r\\nrequires a knowledge of something not given in sense. but before\\r\\nexamining the question of our knowledge of other minds, let us return to\\r\\nthe question of the thing-in-itself, namely, to the theory that what\\r\\nexists at times when we are not perceiving a given sensible object is\\r\\nsomething quite unlike that object, something which, together with us\\r\\nand our sense-organs, causes our sensations, but is never itself given\\r\\nin sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe thing-in-itself, when we start from common-sense assumptions, is a\\r\\nfairly natural outcome of the difficulties due to the changing\\r\\nappearances of what is supposed to be one object. it is supposed that\\r\\nthe table (for example) causes our sense-data of sight and touch, but\\r\\nmust, since these are altered by the point of view and the intervening\\r\\nmedium, be quite different from the sense-data to which it gives rise.\\r\\nthere is, in this theory, a tendency to a confusion from which it\\r\\nderives some of its plausibility, namely, the confusion between a\\r\\nsensation as a psychical occurrence and its object. a patch of colour,\\r\\neven if it only exists when it is seen, is still something quite\\r\\ndifferent from the seeing of it: the seeing of it is mental, but the\\r\\npatch of colour is not. this confusion, however, can be avoided without\\r\\nour necessarily abandoning the theory we are examining. the objection to\\r\\nit, i think, lies in its failure to realise the radical nature of the\\r\\nreconstruction demanded by the difficulties to which it points. we\\r\\ncannot speak legitimately of changes in the point of view and the\\r\\nintervening medium until we have already constructed some world more\\r\\nstable than that of momentary sensation. our discussion of the blue\\r\\nspectacles and the walk round the table has, i hope, made this clear.\\r\\nbut what remains far from clear is the nature of the reconstruction\\r\\nrequired.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough we cannot rest content with the above theory, in the terms in\\r\\nwhich it is stated, we must nevertheless treat it with a certain\\r\\nrespect, for it is in outline the theory upon which physical science and\\r\\nphysiology are built, and it must, therefore, be susceptible of a true\\r\\ninterpretation. let us see how this is to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to realise is that there are no such things as\\r\\n\"illusions of sense.\" objects of sense, even when they occur in dreams,\\r\\nare the most indubitably real objects known to us. what, then, makes us\\r\\ncall them unreal in dreams? merely the unusual nature of their\\r\\nconnection with other objects of sense. i dream that i am in america,\\r\\nbut i wake up and find myself in england without those intervening days\\r\\non the atlantic which, alas! are inseparably connected with a \"real\"\\r\\nvisit to america. objects of sense are called \"real\" when they have the\\r\\nkind of connection with other objects of sense which experience has led\\r\\nus to regard as normal; when they fail in this, they are called\\r\\n\"illusions.\" but what is illusory is only the inferences to which they\\r\\ngive rise; in themselves, they are every bit as real as the objects of\\r\\nwaking life. and conversely, the sensible objects of waking life must\\r\\nnot be expected to have any more intrinsic reality than those of dreams.\\r\\ndreams and waking life, in our first efforts at construction, must be\\r\\ntreated with equal respect; it is only by some reality not _merely_\\r\\nsensible that dreams can be condemned.\\r\\n\\r\\naccepting the indubitable momentary reality of objects of sense, the\\r\\nnext thing to notice is the confusion underlying objections derived from\\r\\ntheir changeableness. as we walk round the table, its aspect changes;\\r\\nbut it is thought impossible to maintain either that the table changes,\\r\\nor that its various aspects can all \"really\" exist in the same place. if\\r\\nwe press one eyeball, we shall see two tables; but it is thought\\r\\npreposterous to maintain that there are \"really\" two tables. such\\r\\narguments, however, seem to involve the assumption that there can be\\r\\nsomething more real than objects of sense. if we see two tables, then\\r\\nthere _are_ two visual tables. it is perfectly true that, at the same\\r\\nmoment, we may discover by touch that there is only one tactile table.\\r\\nthis makes us declare the two visual tables an illusion, because usually\\r\\none visual object corresponds to one tactile object. but all that we are\\r\\nwarranted in saying is that, in this case, the manner of correlation of\\r\\ntouch and sight is unusual. again, when the aspect of the table changes\\r\\nas we walk round it, and we are told there cannot be so many different\\r\\naspects in the same place, the answer is simple: what does the critic of\\r\\nthe table mean by \"the same place\"? the use of such a phrase presupposes\\r\\nthat all our difficulties have been solved; as yet, we have no right to\\r\\nspeak of a \"place\" except with reference to one given set of momentary\\r\\nsense-data. when all are changed by a bodily movement, no place remains\\r\\nthe same as it was. thus the difficulty, if it exists, has at least not\\r\\nbeen rightly stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will now make a new start, adopting a different method. instead of\\r\\ninquiring what is the minimum of assumption by which we can explain the\\r\\nworld of sense, we will, in order to have a model hypothesis as a help\\r\\nfor the imagination, construct one possible (not necessary) explanation\\r\\nof the facts. it may perhaps then be possible to pare away what is\\r\\nsuperfluous in our hypothesis, leaving a residue which may be regarded\\r\\nas the abstract answer to our problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us imagine that each mind looks out upon the world, as in leibniz\\'s\\r\\nmonadology, from a point of view peculiar to itself; and for the sake of\\r\\nsimplicity let us confine ourselves to the sense of sight, ignoring\\r\\nminds which are devoid of this sense. each mind sees at each moment an\\r\\nimmensely complex three-dimensional world; but there is absolutely\\r\\nnothing which is seen by two minds simultaneously. when we say that two\\r\\npeople see the same thing, we always find that, owing to difference of\\r\\npoint of view, there are differences, however slight, between their\\r\\nimmediate sensible objects. (i am here assuming the validity of\\r\\ntestimony, but as we are only constructing a _possible_ theory, that is\\r\\na legitimate assumption.) the three-dimensional world seen by one mind\\r\\ntherefore contains no place in common with that seen by another, for\\r\\nplaces can only be constituted by the things in or around them. hence we\\r\\nmay suppose, in spite of the differences between the different worlds,\\r\\nthat each exists entire exactly as it is perceived, and might be exactly\\r\\nas it is even if it were not perceived. we may further suppose that\\r\\nthere are an infinite number of such worlds which are in fact\\r\\nunperceived. if two men are sitting in a room, two somewhat similar\\r\\nworlds are perceived by them; if a third man enters and sits between\\r\\nthem, a third world, intermediate between the two previous worlds,\\r\\nbegins to be perceived. it is true that we cannot reasonably suppose\\r\\njust this world to have existed before, because it is conditioned by the\\r\\nsense-organs, nerves, and brain of the newly arrived man; but we can\\r\\nreasonably suppose that _some_ aspect of the universe existed from that\\r\\npoint of view, though no one was perceiving it. the system consisting of\\r\\nall views of the universe perceived and unperceived, i shall call the\\r\\nsystem of \"perspectives\"; i shall confine the expression \"private\\r\\nworlds\" to such views of the universe as are actually perceived. thus a\\r\\n\"private world\" is a perceived \"perspective\"; but there may be any\\r\\nnumber of unperceived perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo men are sometimes found to perceive very similar perspectives, so\\r\\nsimilar that they can use the same words to describe them. they say they\\r\\nsee the same table, because the differences between the two tables they\\r\\nsee are slight and not practically important. thus it is possible,\\r\\nsometimes, to establish a correlation by similarity between a great many\\r\\nof the things of one perspective, and a great many of the things of\\r\\nanother. in case the similarity is very great, we say the points of view\\r\\nof the two perspectives are near together in space; but this space in\\r\\nwhich they are near together is totally different from the spaces inside\\r\\nthe two perspectives. it is a relation between the perspectives, and is\\r\\nnot in either of them; no one can perceive it, and if it is to be known\\r\\nit can be only by inference. between two perceived perspectives which\\r\\nare similar, we can imagine a whole series of other perspectives, some\\r\\nat least unperceived, and such that between any two, however similar,\\r\\nthere are others still more similar. in this way the space which\\r\\nconsists of relations between perspectives can be rendered continuous,\\r\\nand (if we choose) three-dimensional.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now define the momentary common-sense \"thing,\" as opposed to its\\r\\nmomentary appearances. by the similarity of neighbouring perspectives,\\r\\nmany objects in the one can be correlated with objects in the other,\\r\\nnamely, with the similar objects. given an object in one perspective,\\r\\nform the system of all the objects correlated with it in all the\\r\\nperspectives; that system may be identified with the momentary\\r\\ncommon-sense \"thing.\" thus an aspect of a \"thing\" is a member of the\\r\\nsystem of aspects which _is_ the \"thing\" at that moment. (the\\r\\ncorrelation of the times of different perspectives raises certain\\r\\ncomplications, of the kind considered in the theory of relativity; but\\r\\nwe may ignore these at present.) all the aspects of a thing are real,\\r\\nwhereas the thing is a mere logical construction. it has, however, the\\r\\nmerit of being neutral as between different points of view, and of being\\r\\nvisible to more than one person, in the only sense in which it can ever\\r\\nbe visible, namely, in the sense that each sees one of its aspects.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be observed that, while each perspective contains its own space,\\r\\nthere is only one space in which the perspectives themselves are the\\r\\nelements. there are as many private spaces as there are perspectives;\\r\\nthere are therefore at least as many as there are percipients, and there\\r\\nmay be any number of others which have a merely material existence and\\r\\nare not seen by anyone. but there is only one perspective-space, whose\\r\\nelements are single perspectives, each with its own private space. we\\r\\nhave now to explain how the private space of a single perspective is\\r\\ncorrelated with part of the one all-embracing perspective space.\\r\\n\\r\\nperspective space is the system of \"points of view\" of private spaces\\r\\n(perspectives), or, since \"points of view\" have not been defined, we may\\r\\nsay it is the system of the private spaces themselves. these private\\r\\nspaces will each count as one point, or at any rate as one element, in\\r\\nperspective space. they are ordered by means of their similarities.\\r\\nsuppose, for example, that we start from one which contains the\\r\\nappearance of a circular disc, such as would be called a penny, and\\r\\nsuppose this appearance, in the perspective in question, is circular,\\r\\nnot elliptic. we can then form a whole series of perspectives containing\\r\\na graduated series of circular aspects of varying sizes: for this\\r\\npurpose we only have to move (as we say) towards the penny or away from\\r\\nit. the perspectives in which the penny looks circular will be said to\\r\\nlie on a straight line in perspective space, and their order on this\\r\\nline will be that of the sizes of the circular aspects. moreover--though\\r\\nthis statement must be noticed and subsequently examined--the\\r\\nperspectives in which the penny looks big will be said to be nearer to\\r\\nthe penny than those in which it looks small. it is to be remarked also\\r\\nthat any other \"thing\" than our penny might have been chosen to define\\r\\nthe relations of our perspectives in perspective space, and that\\r\\nexperience shows that the same spatial order of perspectives would have\\r\\nresulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to explain the correlation of private spaces with perspective\\r\\nspace, we have first to explain what is meant by \"the place (in\\r\\nperspective space) where a thing is.\" for this purpose, let us again\\r\\nconsider the penny which appears in many perspectives. we formed a\\r\\nstraight line of perspectives in which the penny looked circular, and we\\r\\nagreed that those in which it looked larger were to be considered as\\r\\nnearer to the penny. we can form another straight line of perspectives\\r\\nin which the penny is seen end-on and looks like a straight line of a\\r\\ncertain thickness. these two lines will meet in a certain place in\\r\\nperspective space, _i.e._ in a certain perspective, which may be defined\\r\\nas \"the place (in perspective space) where the penny is.\" it is true\\r\\nthat, in order to prolong our lines until they reach this place, we\\r\\nshall have to make use of other things besides the penny, because, so\\r\\nfar as experience goes, the penny ceases to present any appearance after\\r\\nwe have come so near to it that it touches the eye. but this raises no\\r\\nreal difficulty, because the spatial order of perspectives is found\\r\\nempirically to be independent of the particular \"things\" chosen for\\r\\ndefining the order. we can, for example, remove our penny and prolong\\r\\neach of our two straight lines up to their intersection by placing other\\r\\npennies further off in such a way that the aspects of the one are\\r\\ncircular where those of our original penny were circular, and the\\r\\naspects of the other are straight where those of our original penny were\\r\\nstraight. there will then be just one perspective in which one of the\\r\\nnew pennies looks circular and the other straight. this will be, by\\r\\ndefinition, the place where the original penny was in perspective space.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above is, of course, only a first rough sketch of the way in which\\r\\nour definition is to be reached. it neglects the size of the penny, and\\r\\nit assumes that we can remove the penny without being disturbed by any\\r\\nsimultaneous changes in the positions of other things. but it is plain\\r\\nthat such niceties cannot affect the principle, and can only introduce\\r\\ncomplications in its application.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now defined the perspective which is the place where a given\\r\\nthing is, we can understand what is meant by saying that the\\r\\nperspectives in which a thing looks large are nearer to the thing than\\r\\nthose in which it looks small: they are, in fact, nearer to the\\r\\nperspective which is the place where the thing is.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now also explain the correlation between a private space and\\r\\nparts of perspective space. if there is an aspect of a given thing in a\\r\\ncertain private space, then we correlate the place where this aspect is\\r\\nin the private space with the place where the thing is in perspective\\r\\nspace.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may define \"here\" as the place, in perspective space, which is\\r\\noccupied by our private world. thus we can now understand what is meant\\r\\nby speaking of a thing as near to or far from \"here.\" a thing is near to\\r\\n\"here\" if the place where it is is near to my private world. we can also\\r\\nunderstand what is meant by saying that our private world is inside our\\r\\nhead; for our private world is a place in perspective space, and may be\\r\\npart of the place where our head is.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be observed that _two_ places in perspective space are\\r\\nassociated with every aspect of a thing: namely, the place where the\\r\\nthing is, and the place which is the perspective of which the aspect in\\r\\nquestion forms part. every aspect of a thing is a member of two\\r\\ndifferent classes of aspects, namely: (1) the various aspects of the\\r\\nthing, of which at most one appears in any given perspective; (2) the\\r\\nperspective of which the given aspect is a member, _i.e._ that in which\\r\\nthe thing has the given aspect. the physicist naturally classifies\\r\\naspects in the first way, the psychologist in the second. the two places\\r\\nassociated with a single aspect correspond to the two ways of\\r\\nclassifying it. we may distinguish the two places as that _at_ which,\\r\\nand that _from_ which, the aspect appears. the \"place at which\" is the\\r\\nplace of the thing to which the aspect belongs; the \"place from which\"\\r\\nis the place of the perspective to which the aspect belongs.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us now endeavour to state the fact that the aspect which a thing\\r\\npresents at a given place is affected by the intervening medium. the\\r\\naspects of a thing in different perspectives are to be conceived as\\r\\nspreading outwards from the place where the thing is, and undergoing\\r\\nvarious changes as they get further away from this place. the laws\\r\\naccording to which they change cannot be stated if we only take account\\r\\nof the aspects that are near the thing, but require that we should also\\r\\ntake account of the things that are at the places from which these\\r\\naspects appear. this empirical fact can, therefore, be interpreted in\\r\\nterms of our construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now constructed a largely hypothetical picture of the world,\\r\\nwhich contains and places the experienced facts, including those derived\\r\\nfrom testimony. the world we have constructed can, with a certain amount\\r\\nof trouble, be used to interpret the crude facts of sense, the facts of\\r\\nphysics, and the facts of physiology. it is therefore a world which\\r\\n_may_ be actual. it fits the facts, and there is no empirical evidence\\r\\nagainst it; it also is free from logical impossibilities. but have we\\r\\nany good reason to suppose that it is real? this brings us back to our\\r\\noriginal problem, as to the grounds for believing in the existence of\\r\\nanything outside my private world. what we have derived from our\\r\\nhypothetical construction is that there are no grounds _against_ the\\r\\ntruth of this belief, but we have not derived any positive grounds in\\r\\nits favour. we will resume this inquiry by taking up again the question\\r\\nof testimony and the evidence for the existence of other minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nit must be conceded to begin with that the argument in favour of the\\r\\nexistence of other people\\'s minds cannot be conclusive. a phantasm of\\r\\nour dreams will appear to have a mind--a mind to be annoying, as a rule.\\r\\nit will give unexpected answers, refuse to conform to our desires, and\\r\\nshow all those other signs of intelligence to which we are accustomed in\\r\\nthe acquaintances of our waking hours. and yet, when we are awake, we do\\r\\nnot believe that the phantasm was, like the appearances of people in\\r\\nwaking life, representative of a private world to which we have no\\r\\ndirect access. if we are to believe this of the people we meet when we\\r\\nare awake, it must be on some ground short of demonstration, since it is\\r\\nobviously possible that what we call waking life may be only an\\r\\nunusually persistent and recurrent nightmare. it may be that our\\r\\nimagination brings forth all that other people seem to say to us, all\\r\\nthat we read in books, all the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly\\r\\njournals that distract our thoughts, all the advertisements of soap and\\r\\nall the speeches of politicians. this _may_ be true, since it cannot be\\r\\nshown to be false, yet no one can really believe it. is there any\\r\\n_logical_ ground for regarding this possibility as improbable? or is\\r\\nthere nothing beyond habit and prejudice?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe minds of other people are among our data, in the very wide sense in\\r\\nwhich we used the word at first. that is to say, when we first begin to\\r\\nreflect, we find ourselves already believing in them, not because of any\\r\\nargument, but because the belief is natural to us. it is, however, a\\r\\npsychologically derivative belief, since it results from observation of\\r\\npeople\\'s bodies; and along with other such beliefs, it does not belong\\r\\nto the hardest of hard data, but becomes, under the influence of\\r\\nphilosophic reflection, just sufficiently questionable to make us desire\\r\\nsome argument connecting it with the facts of sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe obvious argument is, of course, derived from analogy. other people\\'s\\r\\nbodies behave as ours do when we have certain thoughts and feelings;\\r\\nhence, by analogy, it is natural to suppose that such behaviour is\\r\\nconnected with thoughts and feelings like our own. someone says, \"look\\r\\nout!\" and we find we are on the point of being killed by a motor-car; we\\r\\ntherefore attribute the words we heard to the person in question having\\r\\nseen the motor-car first, in which case there are existing things of\\r\\nwhich we are not directly conscious. but this whole scene, with our\\r\\ninference, may occur in a dream, in which case the inference is\\r\\ngenerally considered to be mistaken. is there anything to make the\\r\\nargument from analogy more cogent when we are (as we think) awake?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe analogy in waking life is only to be preferred to that in dreams on\\r\\nthe ground of its greater extent and consistency. if a man were to dream\\r\\nevery night about a set of people whom he never met by day, who had\\r\\nconsistent characters and grew older with the lapse of years, he might,\\r\\nlike the man in calderon\\'s play, find it difficult to decide which was\\r\\nthe dream-world and which was the so-called \"real\" world. it is only the\\r\\nfailure of our dreams to form a consistent whole either with each other\\r\\nor with waking life that makes us condemn them. certain uniformities are\\r\\nobserved in waking life, while dreams seem quite erratic. the natural\\r\\nhypothesis would be that demons and the spirits of the dead visit us\\r\\nwhile we sleep; but the modern mind, as a rule, refuses to entertain\\r\\nthis view, though it is hard to see what could be said against it. on\\r\\nthe other hand, the mystic, in moments of illumination, seems to awaken\\r\\nfrom a sleep which has filled all his mundane life: the whole world of\\r\\nsense becomes phantasmal, and he sees, with the clarity and\\r\\nconvincingness that belongs to our morning realisation after dreams, a\\r\\nworld utterly different from that of our daily cares and troubles. who\\r\\nshall condemn him? who shall justify him? or who shall justify the\\r\\nseeming solidity of the common objects among which we suppose ourselves\\r\\nto live?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hypothesis that other people have minds must, i think, be allowed to\\r\\nbe not susceptible of any very strong support from the analogical\\r\\nargument. at the same time, it is a hypothesis which systematises a vast\\r\\nbody of facts and never leads to any consequences which there is reason\\r\\nto think false. there is therefore nothing to be said against its truth,\\r\\nand good reason to use it as a working hypothesis. when once it is\\r\\nadmitted, it enables us to extend our knowledge of the sensible world by\\r\\ntestimony, and thus leads to the system of private worlds which we\\r\\nassumed in our hypothetical construction. in actual fact, whatever we\\r\\nmay try to think as philosophers, we cannot help believing in the minds\\r\\nof other people, so that the question whether our belief is justified\\r\\nhas a merely speculative interest. and if it is justified, then there is\\r\\nno further difficulty of principle in that vast extension of our\\r\\nknowledge, beyond our own private data, which we find in science and\\r\\ncommon sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis somewhat meagre conclusion must not be regarded as the whole\\r\\noutcome of our long discussion. the problem of the connection of sense\\r\\nwith objective reality has commonly been dealt with from a standpoint\\r\\nwhich did not carry initial doubt so far as we have carried it; most\\r\\nwriters, consciously or unconsciously, have assumed that the testimony\\r\\nof others is to be admitted, and therefore (at least by implication)\\r\\nthat others have minds. their difficulties have arisen after this\\r\\nadmission, from the differences in the appearance which one physical\\r\\nobject presents to two people at the same time, or to one person at two\\r\\ntimes between which it cannot be supposed to have changed. such\\r\\ndifficulties have made people doubtful how far objective reality could\\r\\nbe known by sense at all, and have made them suppose that there were\\r\\npositive arguments against the view that it can be so known. our\\r\\nhypothetical construction meets these arguments, and shows that the\\r\\naccount of the world given by common sense and physical science can be\\r\\ninterpreted in a way which is logically unobjectionable, and finds a\\r\\nplace for all the data, both hard and soft. it is this hypothetical\\r\\nconstruction, with its reconciliation of psychology and physics, which\\r\\nis the chief outcome of our discussion. probably the construction is\\r\\nonly in part necessary as an initial assumption, and can be obtained\\r\\nfrom more slender materials by the logical methods of which we shall\\r\\nhave an example in the definitions of points, instants, and particles;\\r\\nbut i do not yet know to what lengths this diminution in our initial\\r\\nassumptions can be carried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture iv\\r\\n\\r\\nthe world of physics and the world of sense\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\namong the objections to the reality of objects of sense, there is one\\r\\nwhich is derived from the apparent difference between matter as it\\r\\nappears in physics and things as they appear in sensation. men of\\r\\nscience, for the most part, are willing to condemn immediate data as\\r\\n\"merely subjective,\" while yet maintaining the truth of the physics\\r\\ninferred from those data. but such an attitude, though it may be\\r\\n_capable_ of justification, obviously stands in need of it; and the only\\r\\njustification possible must be one which exhibits matter as a logical\\r\\nconstruction from sense-data--unless, indeed, there were some wholly _a\\r\\npriori_ principle by which unknown entities could be inferred from such\\r\\nas are known. it is therefore necessary to find some way of bridging the\\r\\ngulf between the world of physics and the world of sense, and it is this\\r\\nproblem which will occupy us in the present lecture. physicists appear\\r\\nto be unconscious of the gulf, while psychologists, who are conscious of\\r\\nit, have not the mathematical knowledge required for spanning it. the\\r\\nproblem is difficult, and i do not know its solution in detail. all that\\r\\ni can hope to do is to make the problem felt, and to indicate the kind\\r\\nof methods by which a solution is to be sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us begin by a brief description of the two contrasted worlds. we\\r\\nwill take first the world of physics, for, though the other world is\\r\\ngiven while the physical world is inferred, to us now the world of\\r\\nphysics is the more familiar, the world of pure sense having become\\r\\nstrange and difficult to rediscover. physics started from the\\r\\ncommon-sense belief in fairly permanent and fairly rigid bodies--tables\\r\\nand chairs, stones, mountains, the earth and moon and sun. this\\r\\ncommon-sense belief, it should be noticed, is a piece of audacious\\r\\nmetaphysical theorising; objects are not continually present to\\r\\nsensation, and it may be doubted whether they are there when they are\\r\\nnot seen or felt. this problem, which has been acute since the time of\\r\\nberkeley, is ignored by common sense, and has therefore hitherto been\\r\\nignored by physicists. we have thus here a first departure from the\\r\\nimmediate data of sensation, though it is a departure merely by way of\\r\\nextension, and was probably made by our savage ancestors in some very\\r\\nremote prehistoric epoch.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut tables and chairs, stones and mountains, are not _quite_ permanent\\r\\nor _quite_ rigid. tables and chairs lose their legs, stones are split by\\r\\nfrost, and mountains are cleft by earthquakes and eruptions. then there\\r\\nare other things, which seem material, and yet present almost no\\r\\npermanence or rigidity. breath, smoke, clouds, are examples of such\\r\\nthings--so, in a lesser degree, are ice and snow; and rivers and seas,\\r\\nthough fairly permanent, are not in any degree rigid. breath, smoke,\\r\\nclouds, and generally things that can be seen but not touched, were\\r\\nthought to be hardly real; to this day the usual mark of a ghost is that\\r\\nit can be seen but not touched. such objects were peculiar in the fact\\r\\nthat they seemed to disappear completely, not merely to be transformed\\r\\ninto something else. ice and snow, when they disappear, are replaced by\\r\\nwater; and it required no great theoretical effort to invent the\\r\\nhypothesis that the water was the same thing as the ice and snow, but in\\r\\na new form. solid bodies, when they break, break into parts which are\\r\\npractically the same in shape and size as they were before. a stone can\\r\\nbe hammered into a powder, but the powder consists of grains which\\r\\nretain the character they had before the pounding. thus the ideal of\\r\\nabsolutely rigid and absolutely permanent bodies, which early physicists\\r\\npursued throughout the changing appearances, seemed attainable by\\r\\nsupposing ordinary bodies to be composed of a vast number of tiny atoms.\\r\\nthis billiard-ball view of matter dominated the imagination of\\r\\nphysicists until quite modern times, until, in fact, it was replaced by\\r\\nthe electromagnetic theory, which in its turn is developing into a new\\r\\natomism. apart from the special form of the atomic theory which was\\r\\ninvented for the needs of chemistry, some kind of atomism dominated the\\r\\nwhole of traditional dynamics, and was implied in every statement of its\\r\\nlaws and axioms.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe pictorial accounts which physicists give of the material world as\\r\\nthey conceive it undergo violent changes under the influence of\\r\\nmodifications in theory which are much slighter than the layman might\\r\\nsuppose from the alterations of the description. certain features,\\r\\nhowever, have remained fairly stable. it is always assumed that there is\\r\\n_something_ indestructible which is capable of motion in space; what is\\r\\nindestructible is always very small, but does not always occupy a mere\\r\\npoint in space. there is supposed to be one all-embracing space in which\\r\\nthe motion takes place, and until lately we might have assumed one\\r\\nall-embracing time also. but the principle of relativity has given\\r\\nprominence to the conception of \"local time,\" and has somewhat\\r\\ndiminished men\\'s confidence in the one even-flowing stream of time.\\r\\nwithout dogmatising as to the ultimate outcome of the principle of\\r\\nrelativity, however, we may safely say, i think, that it does not\\r\\ndestroy the possibility of correlating different local times, and does\\r\\nnot therefore have such far-reaching philosophical consequences as is\\r\\nsometimes supposed. in fact, in spite of difficulties as to measurement,\\r\\nthe one all-embracing time still, i think, underlies all that physics\\r\\nhas to say about motion. we thus have still in physics, as we had in\\r\\nnewton\\'s time, a set of indestructible entities which may be called\\r\\nparticles, moving relatively to each other in a single space and a\\r\\nsingle time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe world of immediate data is quite different from this. nothing is\\r\\npermanent; even the things that we think are fairly permanent, such as\\r\\nmountains, only become data when we see them, and are not immediately\\r\\ngiven as existing at other moments. so far from one all-embracing space\\r\\nbeing given, there are several spaces for each person, according to the\\r\\ndifferent senses which give relations that may be called spatial.\\r\\nexperience teaches us to obtain one space from these by correlation, and\\r\\nexperience, together with instinctive theorising, teaches us to\\r\\ncorrelate our spaces with those which we believe to exist in the\\r\\nsensible worlds of other people. the construction of a single time\\r\\noffers less difficulty so long as we confine ourselves to one person\\'s\\r\\nprivate world, but the correlation of one private time with another is a\\r\\nmatter of great difficulty. thus, apart from any of the fluctuating\\r\\nhypotheses of physics, three main problems arise in connecting the world\\r\\nof physics with the world of sense, namely (1) the construction of\\r\\npermanent \"things,\" (2) the construction of a single space, and (3) the\\r\\nconstruction of a single time. we will consider these three problems in\\r\\nsuccession.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the belief in indestructible \"things\" very early took the form of\\r\\natomism. the underlying motive in atomism was not, i think, any\\r\\nempirical success in interpreting phenomena, but rather an instinctive\\r\\nbelief that beneath all the changes of the sensible world there must be\\r\\nsomething permanent and unchanging. this belief was, no doubt, fostered\\r\\nand nourished by its practical successes, culminating in the\\r\\nconservation of mass; but it was not produced by these successes. on the\\r\\ncontrary, they were produced by it. philosophical writers on physics\\r\\nsometimes speak as though the conservation of something or other were\\r\\nessential to the possibility of science, but this, i believe, is an\\r\\nentirely erroneous opinion. if the _a priori_ belief in permanence had\\r\\nnot existed, the same laws which are now formulated in terms of this\\r\\nbelief might just as well have been formulated without it. why should we\\r\\nsuppose that, when ice melts, the water which replaces it is the same\\r\\nthing in a new form? merely because this supposition enables us to state\\r\\nthe phenomena in a way which is consonant with our prejudices. what we\\r\\nreally know is that, under certain conditions of temperature, the\\r\\nappearance we call ice is replaced by the appearance we call water. we\\r\\ncan give laws according to which the one appearance will be succeeded by\\r\\nthe other, but there is no reason except prejudice for regarding both as\\r\\nappearances of the same substance.\\r\\n\\r\\none task, if what has just been said is correct, which confronts us in\\r\\ntrying to connect the world of sense with the world of physics, is the\\r\\ntask of reconstructing the conception of matter without the _a priori_\\r\\nbeliefs which historically gave rise to it. in spite of the\\r\\nrevolutionary results of modern physics, the empirical successes of the\\r\\nconception of matter show that there must be some legitimate conception\\r\\nwhich fulfils roughly the same functions. the time has hardly come when\\r\\nwe can state precisely what this legitimate conception is, but we can\\r\\nsee in a general way what it must be like. for this purpose, it is only\\r\\nnecessary to take our ordinary common-sense statements and reword them\\r\\nwithout the assumption of permanent substance. we say, for example, that\\r\\nthings change gradually--sometimes very quickly, but not without passing\\r\\nthrough a continuous series of intermediate states. what this means is\\r\\nthat, given any sensible appearance, there will usually be, _if we\\r\\nwatch_, a continuous series of appearances connected with the given one,\\r\\nleading on by imperceptible gradations to the new appearances which\\r\\ncommon-sense regards as those of the same thing. thus a thing may be\\r\\ndefined as a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by\\r\\ncontinuity and by certain causal laws. in the case of slowly changing\\r\\nthings, this is easily seen. consider, say, a wall-paper which fades in\\r\\nthe course of years. it is an effort not to conceive of it as one\\r\\n\"thing\" whose colour is slightly different at one time from what it is\\r\\nat another. but what do we really _know_ about it? we know that under\\r\\nsuitable circumstances--_i.e._ when we are, as is said, \"in the\\r\\nroom\"--we perceive certain colours in a certain pattern: not always\\r\\nprecisely the same colours, but sufficiently similar to feel familiar.\\r\\nif we can state the laws according to which the colour varies, we can\\r\\nstate all that is empirically verifiable; the assumption that there is a\\r\\nconstant entity, the wall-paper, which \"has\" these various colours at\\r\\nvarious times, is a piece of gratuitous metaphysics. we may, if we like,\\r\\n_define_ the wall-paper as the series of its aspects. these are\\r\\ncollected together by the same motives which led us to regard the\\r\\nwall-paper as one thing, namely a combination of sensible continuity and\\r\\ncausal connection. more generally, a \"thing\" will be defined as a\\r\\ncertain series of aspects, namely those which would commonly be said to\\r\\nbe _of_ the thing. to say that a certain aspect is an aspect _of_ a\\r\\ncertain thing will merely mean that it is one of those which, taken\\r\\nserially, _are_ the thing. everything will then proceed as before:\\r\\nwhatever was verifiable is unchanged, but our language is so interpreted\\r\\nas to avoid an unnecessary metaphysical assumption of permanence.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above extrusion of permanent things affords an example of the maxim\\r\\nwhich inspires all scientific philosophising, namely \"occam\\'s razor\":\\r\\n_entities are not to be multiplied without necessity._ in other words,\\r\\nin dealing with any subject-matter, find out what entities are\\r\\nundeniably involved, and state everything in terms of these entities.\\r\\nvery often the resulting statement is more complicated and difficult\\r\\nthan one which, like common sense and most philosophy, assumes\\r\\nhypothetical entities whose existence there is no good reason to believe\\r\\nin. we find it easier to imagine a wall-paper with changing colours than\\r\\nto think merely of the series of colours; but it is a mistake to suppose\\r\\nthat what is easy and natural in thought is what is most free from\\r\\nunwarrantable assumptions, as the case of \"things\" very aptly\\r\\nillustrates.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above summary account of the genesis of \"things,\" though it may be\\r\\ncorrect in outline, has omitted some serious difficulties which it is\\r\\nnecessary briefly to consider. starting from a world of helter-skelter\\r\\nsense-data, we wish to collect them into series, each of which can be\\r\\nregarded as consisting of the successive appearances of one \"thing.\"\\r\\nthere is, to begin with, some conflict between what common sense regards\\r\\nas one thing, and what physics regards an unchanging collection of\\r\\nparticles. to common sense, a human body is one thing, but to science\\r\\nthe matter composing it is continually changing. this conflict, however,\\r\\nis not very serious, and may, for our rough preliminary purpose, be\\r\\nlargely ignored. the problem is: by what principles shall we select\\r\\ncertain data from the chaos, and call them all appearances of the same\\r\\nthing?\\r\\n\\r\\na rough and approximate answer to this question is not very difficult.\\r\\nthere are certain fairly stable collections of appearances, such as\\r\\nlandscapes, the furniture of rooms, the faces of acquaintances. in these\\r\\ncases, we have little hesitation in regarding them on successive\\r\\noccasions as appearances of one thing or collection of things. but, as\\r\\nthe _comedy of errors_ illustrates, we may be led astray if we judge by\\r\\nmere resemblance. this shows that something more is involved, for two\\r\\ndifferent things may have any degree of likeness up to exact similarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother insufficient criterion of one thing is _continuity_. as we have\\r\\nalready seen, if we watch what we regard as one changing thing, we\\r\\nusually find its changes to be continuous so far as our senses can\\r\\nperceive. we are thus led to assume that, if we see two finitely\\r\\ndifferent appearances at two different times, and if we have reason to\\r\\nregard them as belonging to the same thing, then there was a continuous\\r\\nseries of intermediate states of that thing during the time when we were\\r\\nnot observing it. and so it comes to be thought that continuity of\\r\\nchange is necessary and sufficient to constitute one thing. but in fact\\r\\nit is neither. it is not _necessary_, because the unobserved states, in\\r\\nthe case where our attention has not been concentrated on the thing\\r\\nthroughout, are purely hypothetical, and cannot possibly be our ground\\r\\nfor supposing the earlier and later appearances to belong to the same\\r\\nthing; on the contrary, it is because we suppose this that we assume\\r\\nintermediate unobserved states. continuity is also not sufficient, since\\r\\nwe can, for example, pass by sensibly continuous gradations from any one\\r\\ndrop of the sea to any other drop. the utmost we can say is that\\r\\ndiscontinuity during uninterrupted observation is as a rule a mark of\\r\\ndifference between things, though even this cannot be said in such cases\\r\\nas sudden explosions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe assumption of continuity is, however, successfully made in physics.\\r\\nthis proves something, though not anything of very obvious utility to\\r\\nour present problem: it proves that nothing in the known world is\\r\\ninconsistent with the hypothesis that all changes are really continuous,\\r\\nthough from too great rapidity or from our lack of observation they may\\r\\nnot always appear continuous. in this hypothetical sense, continuity may\\r\\nbe allowed to be a _necessary_ condition if two appearances are to be\\r\\nclassed as appearances of the same thing. but it is not a _sufficient_\\r\\ncondition, as appears from the instance of the drops in the sea. thus\\r\\nsomething more must be sought before we can give even the roughest\\r\\ndefinition of a \"thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat is wanted further seems to be something in the nature of fulfilment\\r\\nof causal laws. this statement, as it stands, is very vague, but we will\\r\\nendeavour to give it precision. when i speak of \"causal laws,\" i mean\\r\\nany laws which connect events at different times, or even, as a limiting\\r\\ncase, events at the same time provided the connection is not logically\\r\\ndemonstrable. in this very general sense, the laws of dynamics are\\r\\ncausal laws, and so are the laws correlating the simultaneous\\r\\nappearances of one \"thing\" to different senses. the question is: how do\\r\\nsuch laws help in the definition of a \"thing\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nto answer this question, we must consider what it is that is proved by\\r\\nthe empirical success of physics. what is proved is that its hypotheses,\\r\\nthough unverifiable where they go beyond sense-data, are at no point in\\r\\ncontradiction with sense-data, but, on the contrary, are ideally such as\\r\\nto render all sense-data calculable from a sufficient collection of data\\r\\nall belonging to a given period of time. now physics has found it\\r\\nempirically possible to collect sense-data into series, each series\\r\\nbeing regarded as belonging to one \"thing,\" and behaving, with regard to\\r\\nthe laws of physics, in a way in which series not belonging to one thing\\r\\nwould in general not behave. if it is to be unambiguous whether two\\r\\nappearances belong to the same thing or not, there must be only one way\\r\\nof grouping appearances so that the resulting things obey the laws of\\r\\nphysics. it would be very difficult to prove that this is the case, but\\r\\nfor our present purposes we may let this point pass, and assume that\\r\\nthere is only one way. we must include in our definition of a \"thing\"\\r\\nthose of its aspects, if any, which are not observed. thus we may lay\\r\\ndown the following definition: _things are those series of aspects which\\r\\nobey the laws of physics._ that such series exist is an empirical fact,\\r\\nwhich constitutes the verifiability of physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may still be objected that the \"matter\" of physics is something other\\r\\nthan series of sense-data. sense-data, it may be said, belong to\\r\\npsychology and are, at any rate in some sense, subjective, whereas\\r\\nphysics is quite independent of psychological considerations, and does\\r\\nnot assume that its matter only exists when it is perceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nto this objection there are two answers, both of some importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) we have been considering, in the above account, the question of the\\r\\n_verifiability_ of physics. now verifiability is by no means the same\\r\\nthing as truth; it is, in fact, something far more subjective and\\r\\npsychological. for a proposition to be verifiable, it is not enough that\\r\\nit should be true, but it must also be such as we can _discover_ to be\\r\\ntrue. thus verifiability depends upon our capacity for acquiring\\r\\nknowledge, and not only upon the objective truth. in physics, as\\r\\nordinarily set forth, there is much that is unverifiable: there are\\r\\nhypotheses as to (a) how things would appear to a spectator in a place\\r\\nwhere, as it happens, there is no spectator; (b) how things would appear\\r\\nat times when, in fact, they are not appearing to anyone; (c) things\\r\\nwhich never appear at all. all these are introduced to simplify the\\r\\nstatement of the causal laws, but none of them form an integral part of\\r\\nwhat is _known_ to be true in physics. this brings us to our second\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) if physics is to consist wholly of propositions known to be true, or\\r\\nat least capable of being proved or disproved, the three kinds of\\r\\nhypothetical entities we have just enumerated must all be capable of\\r\\nbeing exhibited as logical functions of sense-data. in order to show how\\r\\nthis might possibly be done, let us recall the hypothetical leibnizian\\r\\nuniverse of lecture iii. in that universe, we had a number of\\r\\nperspectives, two of which never had any entity in common, but often\\r\\ncontained entities which could be sufficiently correlated to be regarded\\r\\nas belonging to the same thing. we will call one of these an \"actual\"\\r\\nprivate world when there is an actual spectator to which it appears, and\\r\\n\"ideal\" when it is merely constructed on principles of continuity. a\\r\\nphysical thing consists, at each instant, of the whole set of its\\r\\naspects at that instant, in all the different worlds; thus a momentary\\r\\nstate of a thing is a whole set of aspects. an \"ideal\" appearance will\\r\\nbe an aspect merely calculated, but not actually perceived by any\\r\\nspectator. an \"ideal\" state of a thing will be a state at a moment when\\r\\nall its appearances are ideal. an ideal thing will be one whose states\\r\\nat all times are ideal. ideal appearances, states, and things, since\\r\\nthey are calculated, must be functions of actual appearances, states,\\r\\nand things; in fact, ultimately, they must be functions of actual\\r\\nappearances. thus it is unnecessary, for the enunciation of the laws of\\r\\nphysics, to assign any reality to ideal elements: it is enough to accept\\r\\nthem as logical constructions, provided we have means of knowing how to\\r\\ndetermine when they become actual. this, in fact, we have with some\\r\\ndegree of approximation; the starry heaven, for instance, becomes actual\\r\\nwhenever we choose to look at it. it is open to us to believe that the\\r\\nideal elements exist, and there can be no reason for _dis_believing\\r\\nthis; but unless in virtue of some _a priori_ law we cannot _know_ it,\\r\\nfor empirical knowledge is confined to what we actually observe.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the three main conceptions of physics are space, time, and matter.\\r\\nsome of the problems raised by the conception of matter have been\\r\\nindicated in the above discussion of \"things.\" but space and time also\\r\\nraise difficult problems of much the same kind, namely, difficulties in\\r\\nreducing the haphazard untidy world of immediate sensation to the smooth\\r\\norderly world of geometry and kinematics. let us begin with the\\r\\nconsideration of space.\\r\\n\\r\\npeople who have never read any psychology seldom realise how much mental\\r\\nlabour has gone into the construction of the one all-embracing space\\r\\ninto which all sensible objects are supposed to fit. kant, who was\\r\\nunusually ignorant of psychology, described space as \"an infinite given\\r\\nwhole,\" whereas a moment\\'s psychological reflection shows that a space\\r\\nwhich is infinite is not given, while a space which can be called given\\r\\nis not infinite. what the nature of \"given\" space really is, is a\\r\\ndifficult question, upon which psychologists are by no means agreed. but\\r\\nsome general remarks may be made, which will suffice to show the\\r\\nproblems, without taking sides on any psychological issue still in\\r\\ndebate.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to notice is that different senses have different\\r\\nspaces. the space of sight is quite different from the space of touch:\\r\\nit is only by experience in infancy that we learn to correlate them. in\\r\\nlater life, when we see an object within reach, we know how to touch it,\\r\\nand more or less what it will feel like; if we touch an object with our\\r\\neyes shut, we know where we should have to look for it, and more or less\\r\\nwhat it would look like. but this knowledge is derived from early\\r\\nexperience of the correlation of certain kinds of touch-sensations with\\r\\ncertain kinds of sight-sensations. the one space into which both kinds\\r\\nof sensations fit is an intellectual construction, not a datum. and\\r\\nbesides touch and sight, there are other kinds of sensation which give\\r\\nother, though less important spaces: these also have to be fitted into\\r\\nthe one space by means of experienced correlations. and as in the case\\r\\nof things, so here: the one all-embracing space, though convenient as a\\r\\nway of speaking, need not be supposed really to exist. all that\\r\\nexperience makes certain is the several spaces of the several senses,\\r\\ncorrelated by empirically discovered laws. the one space may turn out to\\r\\nbe valid as a logical construction, compounded of the several spaces,\\r\\nbut there is no good reason to assume its independent metaphysical\\r\\nreality.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother respect in which the spaces of immediate experience differ from\\r\\nthe space of geometry and physics is in regard to _points_. the space of\\r\\ngeometry and physics consists of an infinite number of points, but no\\r\\none has ever seen or touched a point. if there are points in a sensible\\r\\nspace, they must be an inference. it is not easy to see any way in\\r\\nwhich, as independent entities, they could be validly inferred from the\\r\\ndata; thus here again, we shall have, if possible, to find some logical\\r\\nconstruction, some complex assemblage of immediately given objects,\\r\\nwhich will have the geometrical properties required of points. it is\\r\\ncustomary to think of points as simple and infinitely small, but\\r\\ngeometry in no way demands that we should think of them in this way. all\\r\\nthat is necessary for geometry is that they should have mutual relations\\r\\npossessing certain enumerated abstract properties, and it may be that an\\r\\nassemblage of data of sensation will serve this purpose. exactly how\\r\\nthis is to be done, i do not yet know, but it seems fairly certain that\\r\\nit can be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe following illustrative method, simplified so as to be easily\\r\\nmanipulated, has been invented by dr whitehead for the purpose of\\r\\nshowing how points might be manufactured from sense-data. we have first\\r\\nof all to observe that there are no infinitesimal sense-data: any\\r\\nsurface we can see, for example, must be of some finite extent. but what\\r\\nat first appears as one undivided whole is often found, under the\\r\\ninfluence of attention, to split up into parts contained within the\\r\\nwhole. thus one spatial object may be contained within another, and\\r\\nentirely enclosed by the other. this relation of enclosure, by the help\\r\\nof some very natural hypotheses, will enable us to define a \"point\" as a\\r\\ncertain class of spatial objects, namely all those (as it will turn out\\r\\nin the end) which would naturally be said to contain the point. in order\\r\\nto obtain a definition of a \"point\" in this way, we proceed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\ngiven any set of volumes or surfaces, they will not in general converge\\r\\ninto one point. but if they get smaller and smaller, while of any two of\\r\\nthe set there is always one that encloses the other, then we begin to\\r\\nhave the kind of conditions which would enable us to treat them as\\r\\nhaving a point for their limit. the hypotheses required for the relation\\r\\nof enclosure are that (1) it must be transitive; (2) of two _different_\\r\\nspatial objects, it is impossible for each to enclose the other, but a\\r\\nsingle spatial object always encloses itself; (3) any set of spatial\\r\\nobjects such that there is at least one spatial object enclosed by them\\r\\nall has a lower limit or minimum, _i.e._ an object enclosed by all of\\r\\nthem and enclosing all objects which are enclosed by all of them; (4) to\\r\\nprevent trivial exceptions, we must add that there are to be instances\\r\\nof enclosure, _i.e._ there are really to be objects of which one\\r\\nencloses the other. when an enclosure-relation has these properties, we\\r\\nwill call it a \"point-producer.\" given any relation of enclosure, we\\r\\nwill call a set of objects an \"enclosure-series\" if, of any two of them,\\r\\none is contained in the other. we require a condition which shall secure\\r\\nthat an enclosure-series converges to a point, and this is obtained as\\r\\nfollows: let our enclosure-series be such that, given any other\\r\\nenclosure-series of which there are members enclosed in any arbitrarily\\r\\nchosen member of our first series, then there are members of our first\\r\\nseries enclosed in any arbitrarily chosen member of our second series.\\r\\nin this case, our first enclosure-series may be called a \"punctual\\r\\nenclosure-series.\" then a \"point\" is all the objects which enclose\\r\\nmembers of a given punctual enclosure-series. in order to ensure\\r\\ninfinite divisibility, we require one further property to be added to\\r\\nthose defining point-producers, namely that any object which encloses\\r\\nitself also encloses an object other than itself. the \"points\" generated\\r\\nby point-producers with this property will be found to be such as\\r\\ngeometry requires.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) the question of time, so long as we confine ourselves to one private\\r\\nworld, is rather less complicated than that of space, and we can see\\r\\npretty clearly how it might be dealt with by such methods as we have\\r\\nbeen considering. events of which we are conscious do not last merely\\r\\nfor a mathematical instant, but always for some finite time, however\\r\\nshort. even if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory\\r\\nof motion supposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations\\r\\nwhich are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the\\r\\nobjects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not strictly\\r\\ninstantaneous. instants, therefore, are not among the data of\\r\\nexperience, and, if legitimate, must be either inferred or constructed.\\r\\nit is difficult to see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are\\r\\nleft with the alternative that they must be constructed. how is this to\\r\\nbe done?\\r\\n\\r\\nimmediate experience provides us with two time-relations among events:\\r\\nthey may be simultaneous, or one may be earlier and the other later.\\r\\nthese two are both part of the crude data; it is not the case that only\\r\\nthe events are given, and their time-order is added by our subjective\\r\\nactivity. the time-order, within certain limits, is as much given as the\\r\\nevents. in any story of adventure you will find such passages as the\\r\\nfollowing: \"with a cynical smile he pointed the revolver at the breast\\r\\nof the dauntless youth. \\'at the word _three_ i shall fire,\\' he said. the\\r\\nwords one and two had already been spoken with a cool and deliberate\\r\\ndistinctness. the word _three_ was forming on his lips. at this moment a\\r\\nblinding flash of lightning rent the air.\" here we have\\r\\nsimultaneity--not due, as kant would have us believe, to the subjective\\r\\nmental apparatus of the dauntless youth, but given as objectively as the\\r\\nrevolver and the lightning. and it is equally given in immediate\\r\\nexperience that the words _one_ and _two_ come earlier than the flash.\\r\\nthese time-relations hold between events which are not strictly\\r\\ninstantaneous. thus one event may begin sooner than another, and\\r\\ntherefore be before it, but may continue after the other has begun, and\\r\\ntherefore be also simultaneous with it. if it persists after the other\\r\\nis over, it will also be later than the other. earlier, simultaneous,\\r\\nand later, are not inconsistent with each other when we are concerned\\r\\nwith events which last for a finite time, however short; they only\\r\\nbecome inconsistent when we are dealing with something instantaneous.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is to be observed that we cannot give what may be called _absolute_\\r\\ndates, but only dates determined by events. we cannot point to a time\\r\\nitself, but only to some event occurring at that time. there is\\r\\ntherefore no reason in experience to suppose that there are times as\\r\\nopposed to events: the events, ordered by the relations of simultaneity\\r\\nand succession, are all that experience provides. hence, unless we are\\r\\nto introduce superfluous metaphysical entities, we must, in defining\\r\\nwhat mathematical physics can regard as an instant, proceed by means of\\r\\nsome construction which assumes nothing beyond events and their temporal\\r\\nrelations.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we wish to assign a date exactly by means of events, how shall we\\r\\nproceed? if we take any one event, we cannot assign our date exactly,\\r\\nbecause the event is not instantaneous, that is to say, it may be\\r\\nsimultaneous with two events which are not simultaneous with each other.\\r\\nin order to assign a date exactly, we must be able, theoretically, to\\r\\ndetermine whether any given event is before, at, or after this date, and\\r\\nwe must know that any other date is either before or after this date,\\r\\nbut not simultaneous with it. suppose, now, instead of taking one event\\r\\na, we take two events a and b, and suppose a and b partly overlap, but b\\r\\nends before a ends. then an event which is simultaneous with both a and\\r\\nb must exist during the time when a and b overlap; thus we have come\\r\\nrather nearer to a precise date than when we considered a and b alone.\\r\\nlet c be an event which is simultaneous with both a and b, but which\\r\\nends before either a or b has ended. then an event which is simultaneous\\r\\nwith a and b and c must exist during the time when all three overlap,\\r\\nwhich is a still shorter time. proceeding in this way, by taking more\\r\\nand more events, a new event which is dated as simultaneous with all of\\r\\nthem becomes gradually more and more accurately dated. this suggests a\\r\\nway by which a completely accurate date can be defined.\\r\\n\\r\\n        a____________________\\r\\n\\r\\n    b____________________\\r\\n\\r\\n            c________\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take a group of events of which any two overlap, so that there is\\r\\nsome time, however short, when they all exist. if there is any other\\r\\nevent which is simultaneous with all of these, let us add it to the\\r\\ngroup; let us go on until we have constructed a group such that no event\\r\\noutside the group is simultaneous with all of them, but all the events\\r\\ninside the group are simultaneous with each other. let us define this\\r\\nwhole group as an instant of time. it remains to show that it has the\\r\\nproperties we expect of an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat are the properties we expect of instants? first, they must form a\\r\\nseries: of any two, one must be before the other, and the other must be\\r\\nnot before the one; if one is before another, and the other before a\\r\\nthird, the first must be before the third. secondly, every event must be\\r\\nat a certain number of instants; two events are simultaneous if they are\\r\\nat the same instant, and one is before the other if there is an instant,\\r\\nat which the one is, which is earlier than some instant at which the\\r\\nother is. thirdly, if we assume that there is always some change going\\r\\non somewhere during the time when any given event persists, the series\\r\\nof instants ought to be compact, _i.e._ given any two instants, there\\r\\nought to be other instants between them. do instants, as we have defined\\r\\nthem, have these properties?\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall say that an event is \"at\" an instant when it is a member of the\\r\\ngroup by which the instant is constituted; and we shall say that one\\r\\ninstant is before another if the group which is the one instant contains\\r\\nan event which is earlier than, but not simultaneous with, some event in\\r\\nthe group which is the other instant. when one event is earlier than,\\r\\nbut not simultaneous with another, we shall say that it \"wholly\\r\\nprecedes\" the other. now we know that of two events which are not\\r\\nsimultaneous, there must be one which wholly precedes the other, and in\\r\\nthat case the other cannot also wholly precede the one; we also know\\r\\nthat, if one event wholly precedes another, and the other wholly\\r\\nprecedes a third, then the first wholly precedes the third. from these\\r\\nfacts it is easy to deduce that the instants as we have defined them\\r\\nform a series.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have next to show that every event is \"at\" at least one instant,\\r\\n_i.e._ that, given any event, there is at least one class, such as we\\r\\nused in defining instants, of which it is a member. for this purpose,\\r\\nconsider all the events which are simultaneous with a given event, and\\r\\ndo not begin later, _i.e._ are not wholly after anything simultaneous\\r\\nwith it. we will call these the \"initial contemporaries\" of the given\\r\\nevent. it will be found that this class of events is the first instant\\r\\nat which the given event exists, provided every event wholly after some\\r\\ncontemporary of the given event is wholly after some _initial_\\r\\ncontemporary of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally, the series of instants will be compact if, given any two events\\r\\nof which one wholly precedes the other, there are events wholly after\\r\\nthe one and simultaneous with something wholly before the other. whether\\r\\nthis is the case or not, is an empirical question; but if it is not,\\r\\nthere is no reason to expect the time-series to be compact.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [17] the assumptions made concerning time-relations in the above are\\r\\n  as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    i. in order to secure that instants form a series, we assume:\\r\\n\\r\\n      (a) no event wholly precedes itself. (an \"event\" is defined as\\r\\n      whatever is simultaneous with something or other.)\\r\\n\\r\\n      (b) if one event wholly precedes another, and the other wholly\\r\\n      precedes a third, then the first wholly precedes the third.\\r\\n\\r\\n      (c) if one event wholly precedes another, it is not simultaneous\\r\\n      with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      (d) of two events which are not simultaneous, one must wholly\\r\\n      precede the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ii. in order to secure that the initial contemporaries of a given\\r\\n    event should form an instant, we assume:\\r\\n\\r\\n      (e) an event wholly after some contemporary of a given event is\\r\\n      wholly after some _initial_ contemporary of the given event.\\r\\n\\r\\n    iii. in order to secure that the series of instants shall be\\r\\n    compact, we assume:\\r\\n\\r\\n      (f) if one event wholly precedes another, there is an event wholly\\r\\n      after the one and simultaneous with something wholly before the\\r\\n      other.\\r\\n\\r\\n  this assumption entails the consequence that if one event covers the\\r\\n  whole of a stretch of time immediately preceding another event, then\\r\\n  it must have at least one instant in common with the other event;\\r\\n  _i.e._ it is impossible for one event to cease just before another\\r\\n  begins. i do not know whether this should be regarded as inadmissible.\\r\\n  for a mathematico-logical treatment of the above topics, _cf._ n.\\r\\n  wilner, \"a contribution to the theory of relative position,\" _proc.\\r\\n  camb. phil. soc._, xvii. 5, pp. 441-449.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus our definition of instants secures all that mathematics requires,\\r\\nwithout having to assume the existence of any disputable metaphysical\\r\\nentities.\\r\\n\\r\\ninstants may also be defined by means of the enclosure-relation, exactly\\r\\nas was done in the case of points. one object will be temporally\\r\\nenclosed by another when it is simultaneous with the other, but not\\r\\nbefore or after it. whatever encloses temporally or is enclosed\\r\\ntemporally we shall call an \"event.\" in order that the relation of\\r\\ntemporal enclosure may be a \"point-producer,\" we require (1) that it\\r\\nshould be transitive, _i.e._ that if one event encloses another, and the\\r\\nother a third, then the first encloses the third; (2) that every event\\r\\nencloses itself, but if one event encloses another different event, then\\r\\nthe other does not enclose the one; (3) that given any set of events\\r\\nsuch that there is at least one event enclosed by all of them, then\\r\\nthere is an event enclosing all that they all enclose, and itself\\r\\nenclosed by all of them; (4) that there is at least one event. to ensure\\r\\ninfinite divisibility, we require also that every event should enclose\\r\\nevents other than itself. assuming these characteristics, temporal\\r\\nenclosure is an infinitely divisible point-producer. we can now form an\\r\\n\"enclosure-series\" of events, by choosing a group of events such that of\\r\\nany two there is one which encloses the other; this will be a \"punctual\\r\\nenclosure-series\" if, given any other enclosure-series such that every\\r\\nmember of our first series encloses some member of our second, then\\r\\nevery member of our second series encloses some member of our first.\\r\\nthen an \"instant\" is the class of all events which enclose members of a\\r\\ngiven punctual enclosure-series.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe correlation of the times of different private worlds so as to\\r\\nproduce the one all-embracing time of physics is a more difficult\\r\\nmatter. we saw, in lecture iii., that different private worlds often\\r\\ncontain correlated appearances, such as common sense would regard as\\r\\nappearances of the same \"thing.\" when two appearances in different\\r\\nworlds are so correlated as to belong to one momentary \"state\" of a\\r\\nthing, it would be natural to regard them as simultaneous, and as thus\\r\\naffording a simple means of correlating different private times. but\\r\\nthis can only be regarded as a first approximation. what we call one\\r\\nsound will be heard sooner by people near the source of the sound than\\r\\nby people further from it, and the same applies, though in a less\\r\\ndegree, to light. thus two correlated appearances in different worlds\\r\\nare not necessarily to be regarded as occurring at the same date in\\r\\nphysical time, though they will be parts of one momentary state of a\\r\\nthing. the correlation of different private times is regulated by the\\r\\ndesire to secure the simplest possible statement of the laws of physics,\\r\\nand thus raises rather complicated technical problems; but from the\\r\\npoint of view of philosophical theory, there is no very serious\\r\\ndifficulty of principle involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above brief outline must not be regarded as more than tentative and\\r\\nsuggestive. it is intended merely to show the kind of way in which,\\r\\ngiven a world with the kind of properties that psychologists find in the\\r\\nworld of sense, it may be possible, by means of purely logical\\r\\nconstructions, to make it amenable to mathematical treatment by defining\\r\\nseries or classes of sense-data which can be called respectively\\r\\nparticles, points, and instants. if such constructions are possible,\\r\\nthen mathematical physics is applicable to the real world, in spite of\\r\\nthe fact that its particles, points, and instants are not to be found\\r\\namong actually existing entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem which the above considerations are intended to elucidate is\\r\\none whose importance and even existence has been concealed by the\\r\\nunfortunate separation of different studies which prevails throughout\\r\\nthe civilised world. physicists, ignorant and contemptuous of\\r\\nphilosophy, have been content to assume their particles, points, and\\r\\ninstants in practice, while conceding, with ironical politeness, that\\r\\ntheir concepts laid no claim to metaphysical validity. metaphysicians,\\r\\nobsessed by the idealistic opinion that only mind is real, and the\\r\\nparmenidean belief that the real is unchanging, repeated one after\\r\\nanother the supposed contradictions in the notions of matter, space, and\\r\\ntime, and therefore naturally made no endeavour to invent a tenable\\r\\ntheory of particles, points, and instants. psychologists, who have done\\r\\ninvaluable work in bringing to light the chaotic nature of the crude\\r\\nmaterials supplied by unmanipulated sensation, have been ignorant of\\r\\nmathematics and modern logic, and have therefore been content to say\\r\\nthat matter, space, and time are \"intellectual constructions,\" without\\r\\nmaking any attempt to show in detail either how the intellect can\\r\\nconstruct them, or what secures the practical validity which physics\\r\\nshows them to possess. philosophers, it is to be hoped, will come to\\r\\nrecognise that they cannot achieve any solid success in such problems\\r\\nwithout some slight knowledge of logic, mathematics, and physics;\\r\\nmeanwhile, for want of students with the necessary equipment, this vital\\r\\nproblem remains unattempted and unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are, it is true, two authors, both physicists, who have done\\r\\nsomething, though not much, to bring about a recognition of the problem\\r\\nas one demanding study. these two authors are poincare and mach,\\r\\npoincare especially in his _science and hypothesis_, mach especially in\\r\\nhis _analysis of sensations_. both of them, however, admirable as their\\r\\nwork is, seem to me to suffer from a general philosophical bias.\\r\\npoincare is kantian, while mach is ultra-empiricist; with poincare\\r\\nalmost all the mathematical part of physics is merely conventional,\\r\\nwhile with mach the sensation as a mental event is identified with its\\r\\nobject as a part of the physical world. nevertheless, both these\\r\\nauthors, and especially mach, deserve mention as having made serious\\r\\ncontributions to the consideration of our problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen a point or an instant is defined as a class of sensible qualities,\\r\\nthe first impression produced is likely to be one of wild and wilful\\r\\nparadox. certain considerations apply here, however, which will again be\\r\\nrelevant when we come to the definition of numbers. there is a whole\\r\\ntype of problems which can be solved by such definitions, and almost\\r\\nalways there will be at first an effect of paradox. given a set of\\r\\nobjects any two of which have a relation of the sort called \"symmetrical\\r\\nand transitive,\" it is almost certain that we shall come to regard them\\r\\nas all having some common quality, or as all having the same relation to\\r\\nsome one object outside the set. this kind of case is important, and i\\r\\nshall therefore try to make it clear even at the cost of some repetition\\r\\nof previous definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\na relation is said to be \"symmetrical\" when, if one term has this\\r\\nrelation to another, then the other also has it to the one. thus\\r\\n\"brother or sister\" is a \"symmetrical\" relation: if one person is a\\r\\nbrother or a sister of another, then the other is a brother or sister of\\r\\nthe one. simultaneity, again, is a symmetrical relation; so is equality\\r\\nin size. a relation is said to be \"transitive\" when, if one term has\\r\\nthis relation to another, and the other to a third, then the one has it\\r\\nto the third. the symmetrical relations mentioned just now are also\\r\\ntransitive--provided, in the case of \"brother or sister,\" we allow a\\r\\nperson to be counted as his or her own brother or sister, and provided,\\r\\nin the case of simultaneity, we mean complete simultaneity, _i.e._\\r\\nbeginning and ending together.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut many relations are transitive without being symmetrical--for\\r\\ninstance, such relations as \"greater,\" \"earlier,\" \"to the right of,\"\\r\\n\"ancestor of,\" in fact all such relations as give rise to series. other\\r\\nrelations are symmetrical without being transitive--for example,\\r\\ndifference in any respect. if a is of a different age from b, and b of a\\r\\ndifferent age from c, it does not follow that a is of a different age\\r\\nfrom c. simultaneity, again, in the case of events which last for a\\r\\nfinite time, will not necessarily be transitive if it only means that\\r\\nthe times of the two events overlap. if a ends just after b has begun,\\r\\nand b ends just after c has begun, a and b will be simultaneous in this\\r\\nsense, and so will b and c, but a and c may well not be simultaneous.\\r\\n\\r\\nall the relations which can naturally be represented as equality in any\\r\\nrespect, or as possession of a common property, are transitive and\\r\\nsymmetrical--this applies, for example, to such relations as being of\\r\\nthe same height or weight or colour. owing to the fact that possession\\r\\nof a common property gives rise to a transitive symmetrical relation, we\\r\\ncome to imagine that wherever such a relation occurs it must be due to a\\r\\ncommon property. \"being equally numerous\" is a transitive symmetrical\\r\\nrelation of two collections; hence we imagine that both have a common\\r\\nproperty, called their number. \"existing at a given instant\" (in the\\r\\nsense in which we defined an instant) is a transitive symmetrical\\r\\nrelation; hence we come to think that there really is an instant which\\r\\nconfers a common property on all the things existing at that instant.\\r\\n\"being states of a given thing\" is a transitive symmetrical relation;\\r\\nhence we come to imagine that there really is a thing, other than the\\r\\nseries of states, which accounts for the transitive symmetrical\\r\\nrelation. in all such cases, the class of terms that have the given\\r\\ntransitive symmetrical relation to a given term will fulfil all the\\r\\nformal requisites of a common property of all the members of the class.\\r\\nsince there certainly is the class, while any other common property may\\r\\nbe illusory, it is prudent, in order to avoid needless assumptions, to\\r\\nsubstitute the class for the common property which would be ordinarily\\r\\nassumed. this is the reason for the definitions we have adopted, and\\r\\nthis is the source of the apparent paradoxes. no harm is done if there\\r\\nare such common properties as language assumes, since we do not deny\\r\\nthem, but merely abstain from asserting them. but if there are not such\\r\\ncommon properties in any given case, then our method has secured us\\r\\nagainst error. in the absence of special knowledge, therefore, the\\r\\nmethod we have adopted is the only one which is safe, and which avoids\\r\\nthe risk of introducing fictitious metaphysical entities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture v\\r\\n\\r\\nthe theory of continuity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe theory of continuity, with which we shall be occupied in the present\\r\\nlecture, is, in most of its refinements and developments, a purely\\r\\nmathematical subject--very beautiful, very important, and very\\r\\ndelightful, but not, strictly speaking, a part of philosophy. the\\r\\nlogical basis of the theory alone belongs to philosophy, and alone will\\r\\noccupy us to-night. the way the problem of continuity enters into\\r\\nphilosophy is, broadly speaking, the following: space and time are\\r\\ntreated by mathematicians as consisting of points and instants, but they\\r\\nalso have a property, easier to feel than to define, which is called\\r\\ncontinuity, and is thought by many philosophers to be destroyed when\\r\\nthey are resolved into points and instants. zeno, as we shall see,\\r\\nproved that analysis into points and instants was impossible if we\\r\\nadhered to the view that the number of points or instants in a finite\\r\\nspace or time must be finite. later philosophers, believing infinite\\r\\nnumber to be self-contradictory, have found here an antinomy: spaces and\\r\\ntimes could not consist of a _finite_ number of points and instants, for\\r\\nsuch reasons as zeno\\'s; they could not consist of an _infinite_ number\\r\\nof points and instants, because infinite numbers were supposed to be\\r\\nself-contradictory. therefore spaces and times, if real at all, must not\\r\\nbe regarded as composed of points and instants.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut even when points and instants, as independent entities, are\\r\\ndiscarded, as they were by the theory advocated in our last lecture, the\\r\\nproblems of continuity, as i shall try to show presently, remain, in a\\r\\npractically unchanged form. let us therefore, to begin with, admit\\r\\npoints and instants, and consider the problems in connection with this\\r\\nsimpler or at least more familiar hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe argument against continuity, in so far as it rests upon the supposed\\r\\ndifficulties of infinite numbers, has been disposed of by the positive\\r\\ntheory of the infinite, which will be considered in lecture vii. but\\r\\nthere remains a feeling--of the kind that led zeno to the contention\\r\\nthat the arrow in its flight is at rest--which suggests that points and\\r\\ninstants, even if they are infinitely numerous, can only give a jerky\\r\\nmotion, a succession of different immobilities, not the smooth\\r\\ntransitions with which the senses have made us familiar. this feeling is\\r\\ndue, i believe, to a failure to realise imaginatively, as well as\\r\\nabstractly, the nature of continuous series as they appear in\\r\\nmathematics. when a theory has been apprehended logically, there is\\r\\noften a long and serious labour still required in order to _feel_ it: it\\r\\nis necessary to dwell upon it, to thrust out from the mind, one by one,\\r\\nthe misleading suggestions of false but more familiar theories, to\\r\\nacquire the kind of intimacy which, in the case of a foreign language,\\r\\nwould enable us to think and dream in it, not merely to construct\\r\\nlaborious sentences by the help of grammar and dictionary. it is, i\\r\\nbelieve, the absence of this kind of intimacy which makes many\\r\\nphilosophers regard the mathematical doctrine of continuity as an\\r\\ninadequate explanation of the continuity which we experience in the\\r\\nworld of sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the present lecture, i shall first try to explain in outline what the\\r\\nmathematical theory of continuity is in its philosophically important\\r\\nessentials. the application to actual space and time will not be in\\r\\nquestion to begin with. i do not see any reason to suppose that the\\r\\npoints and instants which mathematicians introduce in dealing with space\\r\\nand time are actual physically existing entities, but i do see reason to\\r\\nsuppose that the continuity of actual space and time may be more or less\\r\\nanalogous to mathematical continuity. the theory of mathematical\\r\\ncontinuity is an abstract logical theory, not dependent for its validity\\r\\nupon any properties of actual space and time. what is claimed for it is\\r\\nthat, when it is understood, certain characteristics of space and time,\\r\\npreviously very hard to analyse, are found not to present any logical\\r\\ndifficulty. what we know empirically about space and time is\\r\\ninsufficient to enable us to decide between various mathematically\\r\\npossible alternatives, but these alternatives are all fully intelligible\\r\\nand fully adequate to the observed facts. for the present, however, it\\r\\nwill be well to forget space and time and the continuity of sensible\\r\\nchange, in order to return to these topics equipped with the weapons\\r\\nprovided by the abstract theory of continuity.\\r\\n\\r\\ncontinuity, in mathematics, is a property only possible to a _series_ of\\r\\nterms, _i.e._ to terms arranged in an order, so that we can say of any\\r\\ntwo that one comes _before_ the other. numbers in order of magnitude,\\r\\nthe points on a line from left to right, the moments of time from\\r\\nearlier to later, are instances of series. the notion of order, which is\\r\\nhere introduced, is one which is not required in the theory of cardinal\\r\\nnumber. it is possible to know that two classes have the same number of\\r\\nterms without knowing any order in which they are to be taken. we have\\r\\nan instance of this in such a case as english husbands and english\\r\\nwives: we can see that there must be the same number of husbands as of\\r\\nwives, without having to arrange them in a series. but continuity, which\\r\\nwe are now to consider, is essentially a property of an order: it does\\r\\nnot belong to a set of terms in themselves, but only to a set in a\\r\\ncertain order. a set of terms which can be arranged in one order can\\r\\nalways also be arranged in other orders, and a set of terms which can be\\r\\narranged in a continuous order can always also be arranged in orders\\r\\nwhich are not continuous. thus the essence of continuity must not be\\r\\nsought in the nature of the set of terms, but in the nature of their\\r\\narrangement in a series.\\r\\n\\r\\nmathematicians have distinguished different degrees of continuity, and\\r\\nhave confined the word \"continuous,\" for technical purposes, to series\\r\\nhaving a certain high degree of continuity. but for philosophical\\r\\npurposes, all that is important in continuity is introduced by the\\r\\nlowest degree of continuity, which is called \"compactness.\" a series is\\r\\ncalled \"compact\" when no two terms are consecutive, but between any two\\r\\nthere are others. one of the simplest examples of a compact series is\\r\\nthe series of fractions in order of magnitude. given any two fractions,\\r\\nhowever near together, there are other fractions greater than the one\\r\\nand smaller than the other, and therefore no two fractions are\\r\\nconsecutive. there is no fraction, for example, which is next after 1/2:\\r\\nif we choose some fraction which is very little greater than 1/2, say\\r\\n51/100 we can find others, such as 101/200, which are nearer to 1/2.\\r\\nthus between any two fractions, however little they differ, there are an\\r\\ninfinite number of other fractions. mathematical space and time also\\r\\nhave this property of compactness, though whether actual space and time\\r\\nhave it is a further question, dependent upon empirical evidence, and\\r\\nprobably incapable of being answered with certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the case of abstract objects such as fractions, it is perhaps not\\r\\nvery difficult to realise the logical possibility of their forming a\\r\\ncompact series. the difficulties that might be felt are those of\\r\\ninfinity, for in a compact series the number of terms between any two\\r\\ngiven terms must be infinite. but when these difficulties have been\\r\\nsolved, the mere compactness in itself offers no great obstacle to the\\r\\nimagination. in more concrete cases, however, such as motion,\\r\\ncompactness becomes much more repugnant to our habits of thought. it\\r\\nwill therefore be desirable to consider explicitly the mathematical\\r\\naccount of motion, with a view to making its logical possibility felt.\\r\\nthe mathematical account of motion is perhaps artificially simplified\\r\\nwhen regarded as describing what actually occurs in the physical world;\\r\\nbut what actually occurs must be capable, by a certain amount of logical\\r\\nmanipulation, of being brought within the scope of the mathematical\\r\\naccount, and must, in its analysis, raise just such problems as are\\r\\nraised in their simplest form by this account. neglecting, therefore,\\r\\nfor the present, the question of its physical adequacy, let us devote\\r\\nourselves merely to considering its possibility as a formal statement of\\r\\nthe nature of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to simplify our problem as much as possible, let us imagine a\\r\\ntiny speck of light moving along a scale. what do we mean by saying that\\r\\nthe motion is continuous? it is not necessary for our purposes to\\r\\nconsider the whole of what the mathematician means by this statement:\\r\\nonly part of what he means is philosophically important. one part of\\r\\nwhat he means is that, if we consider any two positions of the speck\\r\\noccupied at any two instants, there will be other intermediate positions\\r\\noccupied at intermediate instants. however near together we take the two\\r\\npositions, the speck will not jump suddenly from the one to the other,\\r\\nbut will pass through an infinite number of other positions on the way.\\r\\nevery distance, however small, is traversed by passing through all the\\r\\ninfinite series of positions between the two ends of the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut at this point imagination suggests that we may describe the\\r\\ncontinuity of motion by saying that the speck always passes from one\\r\\nposition at one instant to _the next_ position at _the next_ instant. as\\r\\nsoon as we say this or imagine it, we fall into error, because there is\\r\\nno _next_ point or _next_ instant. if there were, we should find zeno\\'s\\r\\nparadoxes, in some form, unavoidable, as will appear in our next\\r\\nlecture. one simple paradox may serve as an illustration. if our speck\\r\\nis in motion along the scale throughout the whole of a certain time, it\\r\\ncannot be at the same point at two consecutive instants. but it cannot,\\r\\nfrom one instant to the next, travel further than from one point to the\\r\\nnext, for if it did, there would be no instant at which it was in the\\r\\npositions intermediate between that at the first instant and that at the\\r\\nnext, and we agreed that the continuity of motion excludes the\\r\\npossibility of such sudden jumps. it follows that our speck must, so\\r\\nlong as it moves, pass from one point at one instant to the next point\\r\\nat the next instant. thus there will be just one perfectly definite\\r\\nvelocity with which all motions must take place: no motion can be faster\\r\\nthan this, and no motion can be slower. since this conclusion is false,\\r\\nwe must reject the hypothesis upon which it is based, namely that there\\r\\nare consecutive points and instants.[18] hence the continuity of motion\\r\\nmust not be supposed to consist in a body\\'s occupying consecutive\\r\\npositions at consecutive times.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [18] the above paradox is essentially the same as zeno\\'s argument of\\r\\n  the stadium which will be considered in our next lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difficulty to imagination lies chiefly, i think, in keeping out the\\r\\nsuggestion of _infinitesimal_ distances and times. suppose we halve a\\r\\ngiven distance, and then halve the half, and so on, we can continue the\\r\\nprocess as long as we please, and the longer we continue it, the smaller\\r\\nthe resulting distance becomes. this infinite divisibility seems, at\\r\\nfirst sight, to imply that there are infinitesimal distances, _i.e._\\r\\ndistances so small that any finite fraction of an inch would be greater.\\r\\nthis, however, is an error. the continued bisection of our distance,\\r\\nthough it gives us continually smaller distances, gives us always\\r\\n_finite_ distances. if our original distance was an inch, we reach\\r\\nsuccessively half an inch, a quarter of an inch, an eighth, a sixteenth,\\r\\nand so on; but every one of this infinite series of diminishing\\r\\ndistances is finite. \"but,\" it may be said, \"_in the end_ the distance\\r\\nwill grow infinitesimal.\" no, because there is no end. the process of\\r\\nbisection is one which can, theoretically, be carried on for ever,\\r\\nwithout any last term being attained. thus infinite divisibility of\\r\\ndistances, which must be admitted, does not imply that there are\\r\\ndistances so small that any finite distance would be larger.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is easy, in this kind of question, to fall into an elementary logical\\r\\nblunder. given any finite distance, we can find a smaller distance; this\\r\\nmay be expressed in the ambiguous form \"there is a distance smaller than\\r\\nany finite distance.\" but if this is then interpreted as meaning \"there\\r\\nis a distance such that, whatever finite distance may be chosen, the\\r\\ndistance in question is smaller,\" then the statement is false. common\\r\\nlanguage is ill adapted to expressing matters of this kind, and\\r\\nphilosophers who have been dependent on it have frequently been misled\\r\\nby it.\\r\\n\\r\\nin a continuous motion, then, we shall say that at any given instant the\\r\\nmoving body occupies a certain position, and at other instants it\\r\\noccupies other positions; the interval between any two instants and\\r\\nbetween any two positions is always finite, but the continuity of the\\r\\nmotion is shown in the fact that, however near together we take the two\\r\\npositions and the two instants, there are an infinite number of\\r\\npositions still nearer together, which are occupied at instants that are\\r\\nalso still nearer together. the moving body never jumps from one\\r\\nposition to another, but always passes by a gradual transition through\\r\\nan infinite number of intermediaries. at a given instant, it is where it\\r\\nis, like zeno\\'s arrow;[19] but we cannot say that it is at rest at the\\r\\ninstant, since the instant does not last for a finite time, and there is\\r\\nnot a beginning and end of the instant with an interval between them.\\r\\nrest consists in being in the same position at all the instants\\r\\nthroughout a certain finite period, however short; it does not consist\\r\\nsimply in a body\\'s being where it is at a given instant. this whole\\r\\ntheory, as is obvious, depends upon the nature of compact series, and\\r\\ndemands, for its full comprehension, that compact series should have\\r\\nbecome familiar and easy to the imagination as well as to deliberate\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [19] see next lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat is required may be expressed in mathematical language by saying\\r\\nthat the position of a moving body must be a continuous function of the\\r\\ntime. to define accurately what this means, we proceed as follows.\\r\\nconsider a particle which, at the moment _t_, is at the point p. choose\\r\\nnow any small portion p1p2 of the path of the particle, this portion\\r\\nbeing one which contains p. we say then that, if the motion of the\\r\\nparticle is continuous at the time _t_, it must be possible to find two\\r\\ninstants _t_1, _t_2, one earlier than _t_ and one later, such that\\r\\nthroughout the whole time from _t_1 to _t_2 (both included), the\\r\\nparticle lies between p1 and p2. and we say that this must still hold\\r\\nhowever small we make the portion p1p2. when this is the case, we say\\r\\nthat the motion is continuous at the time _t_; and when the motion is\\r\\ncontinuous at all times, we say that the motion as a whole is\\r\\ncontinuous. it is obvious that if the particle were to jump suddenly\\r\\nfrom p to some other point q, our definition would fail for all\\r\\nintervals p1p2 which were too small to include q. thus our definition\\r\\naffords an analysis of the continuity of motion, while admitting points\\r\\nand instants and denying infinitesimal distances in space or periods in\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n        p1   p    p2   q\\r\\n  ------|----|----|----|------>\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophers, mostly in ignorance of the mathematician\\'s analysis, have\\r\\nadopted other and more heroic methods of dealing with the _prima facie_\\r\\ndifficulties of continuous motion. a typical and recent example of\\r\\nphilosophic theories of motion is afforded by bergson, whose views on\\r\\nthis subject i have examined elsewhere.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [20] _monist_, july 1912, pp. 337-341.\\r\\n\\r\\napart from definite arguments, there are certain feelings, rather than\\r\\nreasons, which stand in the way of an acceptance of the mathematical\\r\\naccount of motion. to begin with, if a body is moving at all fast, we\\r\\n_see_ its motion just as we see its colour. a _slow_ motion, like that\\r\\nof the hour-hand of a watch, is only known in the way which mathematics\\r\\nwould lead us to expect, namely by observing a change of position after\\r\\na lapse of time; but, when we observe the motion of the second-hand, we\\r\\ndo not merely see first one position and then another--we see something\\r\\nas directly sensible as colour. what is this something that we see, and\\r\\nthat we call visible motion? whatever it is, it is _not_ the successive\\r\\noccupation of successive positions: something beyond the mathematical\\r\\ntheory of motion is required to account for it. opponents of the\\r\\nmathematical theory emphasise this fact. \"your theory,\" they say, \"may\\r\\nbe very logical, and might apply admirably to some other world; but in\\r\\nthis actual world, actual motions are quite different from what your\\r\\ntheory would declare them to be, and require, therefore, some different\\r\\nphilosophy from yours for their adequate explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe objection thus raised is one which i have no wish to underrate, but\\r\\ni believe it can be fully answered without departing from the methods\\r\\nand the outlook which have led to the mathematical theory of motion. let\\r\\nus, however, first try to state the objection more fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nif the mathematical theory is adequate, nothing happens when a body\\r\\nmoves except that it is in different places at different times. but in\\r\\nthis sense the hour-hand and the second-hand are equally in motion, yet\\r\\nin the second-hand there is something perceptible to our senses which is\\r\\nabsent in the hour-hand. we can see, at each moment, that the\\r\\nsecond-hand _is moving_, which is different from seeing it first in one\\r\\nplace and then in another. this seems to involve our seeing it\\r\\nsimultaneously in a number of places, although it must also involve our\\r\\nseeing that it is in some of these places earlier than in others. if,\\r\\nfor example, i move my hand quickly from left to right, you seem to see\\r\\nthe whole movement at once, in spite of the fact that you know it begins\\r\\nat the left and ends at the right. it is this kind of consideration, i\\r\\nthink, which leads bergson and many others to regard a movement as\\r\\nreally one indivisible whole, not the series of separate states imagined\\r\\nby the mathematician.\\r\\n\\r\\nto this objection there are three supplementary answers, physiological,\\r\\npsychological, and logical. we will consider them successively.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the physiological answer merely shows that, if the physical world is\\r\\nwhat the mathematician supposes, its sensible appearance may\\r\\nnevertheless be expected to be what it is. the aim of this answer is\\r\\nthus the modest one of showing that the mathematical account is not\\r\\nimpossible as applied to the physical world; it does not even attempt to\\r\\nshow that this account is necessary, or that an analogous account\\r\\napplies in psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen any nerve is stimulated, so as to cause a sensation, the sensation\\r\\ndoes not cease instantaneously with the cessation of the stimulus, but\\r\\ndies away in a short finite time. a flash of lightning, brief as it is\\r\\nto our sight, is briefer still as a physical phenomenon: we continue to\\r\\nsee it for a few moments after the light-waves have ceased to strike the\\r\\neye. thus in the case of a physical motion, if it is sufficiently swift,\\r\\nwe shall actually at one instant see the moving body throughout a finite\\r\\nportion of its course, and not only at the exact spot where it is at\\r\\nthat instant. sensations, however, as they die away, grow gradually\\r\\nfainter; thus the sensation due to a stimulus which is recently past is\\r\\nnot exactly like the sensation due to a present stimulus. it follows\\r\\nfrom this that, when we see a rapid motion, we shall not only see a\\r\\nnumber of positions of the moving body simultaneously, but we shall see\\r\\nthem with different degrees of intensity--the present position most\\r\\nvividly, and the others with diminishing vividness, until sensation\\r\\nfades away into immediate memory. this state of things accounts fully\\r\\nfor the perception of motion. a motion is _perceived_, not merely\\r\\n_inferred_, when it is sufficiently swift for many positions to be\\r\\nsensible at one time; and the earlier and later parts of one perceived\\r\\nmotion are distinguished by the less and greater vividness of the\\r\\nsensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis answer shows that physiology can account for our perception of\\r\\nmotion. but physiology, in speaking of stimulus and sense-organs and a\\r\\nphysical motion distinct from the immediate object of sense, is assuming\\r\\nthe truth of physics, and is thus only capable of showing the physical\\r\\naccount to be possible, not of showing it to be _necessary_. this\\r\\nconsideration brings us to the psychological answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the psychological answer to our difficulty about motion is part of a\\r\\nvast theory, not yet worked out, and only capable, at present, of being\\r\\nvaguely outlined. we considered this theory in the third and fourth\\r\\nlectures; for the present, a mere sketch of its application to our\\r\\npresent problem must suffice. the world of physics, which was assumed in\\r\\nthe physiological answer, is obviously inferred from what is given in\\r\\nsensation; yet as soon as we seriously consider what is actually given\\r\\nin sensation, we find it apparently very different from the world of\\r\\nphysics. the question is thus forced upon us: is the inference from\\r\\nsense to physics a valid one? i believe the answer to be affirmative,\\r\\nfor reasons which i suggested in the third and fourth lectures; but the\\r\\nanswer cannot be either short or easy. it consists, broadly speaking, in\\r\\nshowing that, although the particles, points, and instants with which\\r\\nphysics operates are not themselves given in experience, and are very\\r\\nlikely not actually existing things, yet, out of the materials provided\\r\\nin sensation, it is possible to make logical constructions having the\\r\\nmathematical properties which physics assigns to particles, points, and\\r\\ninstants. if this can be done, then all the propositions of physics can\\r\\nbe translated, by a sort of dictionary, into propositions about the\\r\\nkinds of objects which are given in sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\napplying these general considerations to the case of motion, we find\\r\\nthat, even within the sphere of immediate sense-data, it is necessary,\\r\\nor at any rate more consonant with the facts than any other equally\\r\\nsimple view, to distinguish instantaneous states of objects, and to\\r\\nregard such states as forming a compact series. let us consider a body\\r\\nwhich is moving swiftly enough for its motion to be perceptible, and\\r\\nlong enough for its motion to be not wholly comprised in one sensation.\\r\\nthen, in spite of the fact that we see a finite extent of the motion at\\r\\none instant, the extent which we see at one instant is different from\\r\\nthat which we see at another. thus we are brought back, after all, to a\\r\\nseries of momentary views of the moving body, and this series will be\\r\\ncompact, like the former physical series of points. in fact, though the\\r\\n_terms_ of the series seem different, the mathematical character of the\\r\\nseries is unchanged, and the whole mathematical theory of motion will\\r\\napply to it _verbatim_.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we are considering the actual data of sensation in this connection,\\r\\nit is important to realise that two sense-data may be, and _must_\\r\\nsometimes be, really different when we cannot perceive any difference\\r\\nbetween them. an old but conclusive reason for believing this was\\r\\nemphasised by poincare.[21] in all cases of sense-data capable of\\r\\ngradual change, we may find one sense-datum indistinguishable from\\r\\nanother, and that other indistinguishable from a third, while yet the\\r\\nfirst and third are quite easily distinguishable. suppose, for example,\\r\\na person with his eyes shut is holding a weight in his hand, and someone\\r\\nnoiselessly adds a small extra weight. if the extra weight is small\\r\\nenough, no difference will be perceived in the sensation. after a time,\\r\\nanother small extra weight may be added, and still no change will be\\r\\nperceived; but if both extra weights had been added at once, it may be\\r\\nthat the change would be quite easily perceptible. or, again, take\\r\\nshades of colour. it would be easy to find three stuffs of such closely\\r\\nsimilar shades that no difference could be perceived between the first\\r\\nand second, nor yet between the second and third, while yet the first\\r\\nand third would be distinguishable. in such a case, the second shade\\r\\ncannot be the same as the first, or it would be distinguishable from the\\r\\nthird; nor the same as the third, or it would be distinguishable from\\r\\nthe first. it must, therefore, though indistinguishable from both, be\\r\\nreally intermediate between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [21] \"le continu mathematique,\" _revue de metaphysique et de morale_,\\r\\n  vol. i. p. 29.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch considerations as the above show that, although we cannot\\r\\ndistinguish sense-data unless they differ by more than a certain amount,\\r\\nit is perfectly reasonable to suppose that sense-data of a given kind,\\r\\nsuch as weights or colours, really form a compact series. the objections\\r\\nwhich may be brought from a psychological point of view against the\\r\\nmathematical theory of motion are not, therefore, objections to this\\r\\ntheory properly understood, but only to a quite unnecessary assumption\\r\\nof simplicity in the momentary object of sense. of the immediate object\\r\\nof sense, in the case of a visible motion, we may say that at each\\r\\ninstant it is in all the positions which remain sensible at that\\r\\ninstant; but this set of positions changes continuously from moment to\\r\\nmoment, and is amenable to exactly the same mathematical treatment as if\\r\\nit were a mere point. when we assert that some mathematical account of\\r\\nphenomena is correct, all that we primarily assert is that _something_\\r\\ndefinable in terms of the crude phenomena satisfies our formulae; and in\\r\\nthis sense the mathematical theory of motion is applicable to the data\\r\\nof sensation as well as to the supposed particles of abstract physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are a number of distinct questions which are apt to be confused\\r\\nwhen the mathematical continuum is said to be inadequate to the facts of\\r\\nsense. we may state these, in order of diminishing generality, as\\r\\nfollows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    (a) are series possessing mathematical continuity logically\\r\\n    possible?\\r\\n\\r\\n    (b) assuming that they are possible logically, are they not\\r\\n    impossible as applied to actual sense-data, because, among actual\\r\\n    sense-data, there are no such fixed mutually external terms as are\\r\\n    to be found, _e.g._, in the series of fractions?\\r\\n\\r\\n    (c) does not the assumption of points and instants make the whole\\r\\n    mathematical account fictitious?\\r\\n\\r\\n    (d) finally, assuming that all these objections have been answered,\\r\\n    is there, in actual empirical fact, any sufficient reason to believe\\r\\n    the world of sense continuous?\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us consider these questions in succession.\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the question of the logical possibility of the mathematical\\r\\ncontinuum turns partly on the elementary misunderstandings we considered\\r\\nat the beginning of the present lecture, partly on the possibility of\\r\\nthe mathematical infinite, which will occupy our next two lectures, and\\r\\npartly on the logical form of the answer to the bergsonian objection\\r\\nwhich we stated a few minutes ago. i shall say no more on this topic at\\r\\npresent, since it is desirable first to complete the psychological\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) the question whether sense-data are composed of mutually external\\r\\nunits is not one which can be decided by empirical evidence. it is often\\r\\nurged that, as a matter of immediate experience, the sensible flux is\\r\\ndevoid of divisions, and is falsified by the dissections of the\\r\\nintellect. now i have no wish to argue that this view is _contrary_ to\\r\\nimmediate experience: i wish only to maintain that it is essentially\\r\\nincapable of being _proved_ by immediate experience. as we saw, there\\r\\nmust be among sense-data differences so slight as to be imperceptible:\\r\\nthe fact that sense-data are immediately given does not mean that their\\r\\ndifferences also _must_ be immediately given (though they _may_ be).\\r\\nsuppose, for example, a coloured surface on which the colour changes\\r\\ngradually--so gradually that the difference of colour in two very\\r\\nneighbouring portions is imperceptible, while the difference between\\r\\nmore widely separated portions is quite noticeable. the effect produced,\\r\\nin such a case, will be precisely that of \"interpenetration,\" of\\r\\ntransition which is not a matter of discrete units. and since it tends\\r\\nto be supposed that the colours, being immediate data, must _appear_\\r\\ndifferent if they _are_ different, it seems easily to follow that\\r\\n\"interpenetration\" must be the ultimately right account. but this does\\r\\nnot follow. it is unconsciously assumed, as a premiss for a _reductio ad\\r\\nabsurdum_ of the analytic view, that, if a and b are immediate data, and\\r\\na differs from b, then the fact that they differ must also be an\\r\\nimmediate datum. it is difficult to say how this assumption arose, but i\\r\\nthink it is to be connected with the confusion between \"acquaintance\"\\r\\nand \"knowledge about.\" acquaintance, which is what we derive from sense,\\r\\ndoes not, theoretically at least, imply even the smallest \"knowledge\\r\\nabout,\" _i.e._ it does not imply knowledge of any proposition concerning\\r\\nthe object with which we are acquainted. it is a mistake to speak as if\\r\\nacquaintance had degrees: there is merely acquaintance and\\r\\nnon-acquaintance. when we speak of becoming \"better acquainted,\" as for\\r\\ninstance with a person, what we must mean is, becoming acquainted with\\r\\nmore parts of a certain whole; but the acquaintance with each part is\\r\\neither complete or nonexistent. thus it is a mistake to say that if we\\r\\nwere perfectly acquainted with an object we should know all about it.\\r\\n\"knowledge about\" is knowledge of propositions, which is not involved\\r\\nnecessarily in acquaintance with the constituents of the propositions.\\r\\nto know that two shades of colour are different is knowledge about them;\\r\\nhence acquaintance with the two shades does not in any way necessitate\\r\\nthe knowledge that they are different.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom what has just been said it follows that the nature of sense-data\\r\\ncannot be validly used to prove that they are not composed of mutually\\r\\nexternal units. it may be admitted, on the other hand, that nothing in\\r\\ntheir empirical character specially necessitates the view that they are\\r\\ncomposed of mutually external units. this view, if it is held, must be\\r\\nheld on logical, not on empirical, grounds. i believe that the logical\\r\\ngrounds are adequate to the conclusion. they rest, at bottom, upon the\\r\\nimpossibility of explaining complexity without assuming constituents. it\\r\\nis undeniable that the visual field, for example, is complex; and so far\\r\\nas i can see, there is always self-contradiction in the theories which,\\r\\nwhile admitting this complexity, attempt to deny that it results from a\\r\\ncombination of mutually external units. but to pursue this topic would\\r\\nlead us too far from our theme, and i shall therefore say no more about\\r\\nit at present.\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) it is sometimes urged that the mathematical account of motion is\\r\\nrendered fictitious by its assumption of points and instants. now there\\r\\nare here two different questions to be distinguished. there is the\\r\\nquestion of absolute or relative space and time, and there is the\\r\\nquestion whether what occupies space and time must be composed of\\r\\nelements which have no extension or duration. and each of these\\r\\nquestions in turn may take two forms, namely: (a) is the hypothesis\\r\\n_consistent_ with the facts and with logic? (b) is it _necessitated_ by\\r\\nthe facts or by logic? i wish to answer, in each case, yes to the first\\r\\nform of the question, and no to the second. but in any case the\\r\\nmathematical account of motion will not be fictitious, provided a right\\r\\ninterpretation is given to the words \"point\" and \"instant.\" a few words\\r\\non each alternative will serve to make this clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nformally, mathematics adopts an absolute theory of space and time,\\r\\n_i.e._ it assumes that, besides the things which are in space and time,\\r\\nthere are also entities, called \"points\" and \"instants,\" which are\\r\\noccupied by things. this view, however, though advocated by newton, has\\r\\nlong been regarded by mathematicians as merely a convenient fiction.\\r\\nthere is, so far as i can see, no conceivable evidence either for or\\r\\nagainst it. it is logically possible, and it is consistent with the\\r\\nfacts. but the facts are also consistent with the denial of spatial and\\r\\ntemporal entities over and above things with spatial and temporal\\r\\nrelations. hence, in accordance with occam\\'s razor, we shall do well to\\r\\nabstain from either assuming or denying points and instants. this means,\\r\\nso far as practical working out is concerned, that we adopt the\\r\\nrelational theory; for in practice the refusal to assume points and\\r\\ninstants has the same effect as the denial of them. but in strict theory\\r\\nthe two are quite different, since the denial introduces an element of\\r\\nunverifiable dogma which is wholly absent when we merely refrain from\\r\\nthe assertion. thus, although we shall derive points and instants from\\r\\nthings, we shall leave the bare possibility open that they may also have\\r\\nan independent existence as simple entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe come now to the question whether the things in space and time are to\\r\\nbe conceived as composed of elements without extension or duration,\\r\\n_i.e._ of elements which only occupy a point and an instant. physics,\\r\\nformally, assumes in its differential equations that things consist of\\r\\nelements which occupy only a point at each instant, but persist\\r\\nthroughout time. for reasons explained in lecture iv., the persistence\\r\\nof things through time is to be regarded as the formal result of a\\r\\nlogical construction, not as necessarily implying any actual\\r\\npersistence. the same motives, in fact, which lead to the division of\\r\\nthings into point-particles, ought presumably to lead to their division\\r\\ninto instant-particles, so that the ultimate _formal_ constituent of the\\r\\nmatter in physics will be a point-instant-particle. but such objects, as\\r\\nwell as the particles of physics, are not data. the same economy of\\r\\nhypothesis, which dictates the practical adoption of a relative rather\\r\\nthan an absolute space and time, also dictates the practical adoption of\\r\\nmaterial elements which have a finite extension and duration. since, as\\r\\nwe saw in lecture iv., points and instants can be constructed as logical\\r\\nfunctions of such elements, the mathematical account of motion, in which\\r\\na particle passes continuously through a continuous series of points,\\r\\ncan be interpreted in a form which assumes only elements which agree\\r\\nwith our actual data in having a finite extension and duration. thus, so\\r\\nfar as the use of points and instants is concerned, the mathematical\\r\\naccount of motion can be freed from the charge of employing fictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) but we must now face the question: is there, in actual empirical\\r\\nfact, any sufficient reason to believe the world of sense continuous?\\r\\nthe answer here must, i think, be in the negative. we may say that the\\r\\nhypothesis of continuity is perfectly consistent with the facts and with\\r\\nlogic, and that it is technically simpler than any other tenable\\r\\nhypothesis. but since our powers of discrimination among very similar\\r\\nsensible objects are not infinitely precise, it is quite impossible to\\r\\ndecide between different theories which only differ in regard to what is\\r\\nbelow the margin of discrimination. if, for example, a coloured surface\\r\\nwhich we see consists of a finite number of very small surfaces, and if\\r\\na motion which we see consists, like a cinematograph, of a large finite\\r\\nnumber of successive positions, there will be nothing empirically\\r\\ndiscoverable to show that objects of sense are not continuous. in what\\r\\nis called _experienced_ continuity, such as is said to be given in\\r\\nsense, there is a large negative element: absence of perception of\\r\\ndifference occurs in cases which are _thought_ to give perception of\\r\\nabsence of difference. when, for example, we cannot distinguish a colour\\r\\na from a colour b, nor a colour b from a colour c, but can distinguish a\\r\\nfrom c, the indistinguishability is a purely negative fact, namely, that\\r\\nwe do not _perceive_ a difference. even in regard to immediate data,\\r\\nthis is no reason for denying that there is a difference. thus, if we\\r\\nsee a coloured surface whose colour changes gradually, its sensible\\r\\nappearance if the change is continuous will be indistinguishable from\\r\\nwhat it would be if the change were by small finite jumps. if this is\\r\\ntrue, as it seems to be, it follows that there can never be any\\r\\nempirical evidence to demonstrate that the sensible world is continuous,\\r\\nand not a collection of a very large finite number of elements of which\\r\\neach differs from its neighbour in a finite though very small degree.\\r\\nthe continuity of space and time, the infinite number of different\\r\\nshades in the spectrum, and so on, are all in the nature of unverifiable\\r\\nhypotheses--perfectly possible logically, perfectly consistent with the\\r\\nknown facts, and simpler technically than any other tenable hypotheses,\\r\\nbut not the sole hypotheses which are logically and empirically\\r\\nadequate.\\r\\n\\r\\nif a relational theory of instants is constructed, in which an \"instant\"\\r\\nis defined as a group of events simultaneous with each other and not all\\r\\nsimultaneous with any event outside the group, then if our resulting\\r\\nseries of instants is to be compact, it must be possible, if _x_ wholly\\r\\nprecedes _y_, to find an event _z_, simultaneous with part of _x_, which\\r\\nwholly precedes some event which wholly precedes _y_. now this requires\\r\\nthat the number of events concerned should be infinite in any finite\\r\\nperiod of time. if this is to be the case in the world of one man\\'s\\r\\nsense-data, and if each sense-datum is to have not less than a certain\\r\\nfinite temporal extension, it will be necessary to assume that we always\\r\\nhave an infinite number of sense-data simultaneous with any given\\r\\nsense-datum. applying similar considerations to space, and assuming that\\r\\nsense-data are to have not less than a certain spatial extension, it\\r\\nwill be necessary to suppose that an infinite number of sense-data\\r\\noverlap spatially with any given sense-datum. this hypothesis is\\r\\npossible, if we suppose a single sense-datum, _e.g._ in sight, to be a\\r\\nfinite surface, enclosing other surfaces which are also single\\r\\nsense-data. but there are difficulties in such a hypothesis, and i do\\r\\nnot know whether these difficulties could be successfully met. if they\\r\\ncannot, we must do one of two things: either declare that the world of\\r\\none man\\'s sense-data is not continuous, or else refuse to admit that\\r\\nthere is any lower limit to the duration and extension of a single\\r\\nsense-datum. i do not know what is the right course to adopt as regards\\r\\nthese alternatives. the logical analysis we have been considering\\r\\nprovides the apparatus for dealing with the various hypotheses, and the\\r\\nempirical decision between them is a problem for the psychologist.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) we have now to consider the _logical_ answer to the alleged\\r\\ndifficulties of the mathematical theory of motion, or rather to the\\r\\npositive theory which is urged on the other side. the view urged\\r\\nexplicitly by bergson, and implied in the doctrines of many\\r\\nphilosophers, is, that a motion is something indivisible, not validly\\r\\nanalysable into a series of states. this is part of a much more general\\r\\ndoctrine, which holds that analysis always falsifies, because the parts\\r\\nof a complex whole are different, as combined in that whole, from what\\r\\nthey would otherwise be. it is very difficult to state this doctrine in\\r\\nany form which has a precise meaning. often arguments are used which\\r\\nhave no bearing whatever upon the question. it is urged, for example,\\r\\nthat when a man becomes a father, his nature is altered by the new\\r\\nrelation in which he finds himself, so that he is not strictly identical\\r\\nwith the man who was previously not a father. this may be true, but it\\r\\nis a causal psychological fact, not a logical fact. the doctrine would\\r\\nrequire that a man who is a father cannot be strictly identical with a\\r\\nman who is a son, because he is modified in one way by the relation of\\r\\nfatherhood and in another by that of sonship. in fact, we may give a\\r\\nprecise statement of the doctrine we are combating in the form: _there\\r\\ncan never be two facts concerning the same thing._ a fact concerning a\\r\\nthing always is or involves a relation to one or more entities; thus two\\r\\nfacts concerning the same thing would involve two relations of the same\\r\\nthing. but the doctrine in question holds that a thing is so modified by\\r\\nits relations that it cannot be the same in one relation as in another.\\r\\nhence, if this doctrine is true, there can never be more than one fact\\r\\nconcerning any one thing. i do not think the philosophers in question\\r\\nhave realised that this is the precise statement of the view they\\r\\nadvocate, because in this form the view is so contrary to plain truth\\r\\nthat its falsehood is evident as soon as it is stated. the discussion of\\r\\nthis question, however, involves so many logical subtleties, and is so\\r\\nbeset with difficulties, that i shall not pursue it further at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen once the above general doctrine is rejected, it is obvious that,\\r\\nwhere there is change, there must be a succession of states. there\\r\\ncannot be change--and motion is only a particular case of change--unless\\r\\nthere is something different at one time from what there is at some\\r\\nother time. change, therefore, must involve relations and complexity,\\r\\nand must demand analysis. so long as our analysis has only gone as far\\r\\nas other smaller changes, it is not complete; if it is to be complete,\\r\\nit must end with terms that are not changes, but are related by a\\r\\nrelation of earlier and later. in the case of changes which appear\\r\\ncontinuous, such as motions, it seems to be impossible to find anything\\r\\nother than change so long as we deal with finite periods of time,\\r\\nhowever short. we are thus driven back, by the logical necessities of\\r\\nthe case, to the conception of instants without duration, or at any rate\\r\\nwithout any duration which even the most delicate instruments can\\r\\nreveal. this conception, though it can be made to seem difficult, is\\r\\nreally easier than any other that the facts allow. it is a kind of\\r\\nlogical framework into which any tenable theory must fit--not\\r\\nnecessarily itself the statement of the crude facts, but a form in which\\r\\nstatements which are true of the crude facts can be made by a suitable\\r\\ninterpretation. the direct consideration of the crude facts of the\\r\\nphysical world has been undertaken in earlier lectures; in the present\\r\\nlecture, we have only been concerned to show that nothing in the crude\\r\\nfacts is inconsistent with the mathematical doctrine of continuity, or\\r\\ndemands a continuity of a radically different kind from that of\\r\\nmathematical motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture vi\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem of infinity considered historically\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be remembered that, when we enumerated the grounds upon which\\r\\nthe reality of the sensible world has been questioned, one of those\\r\\nmentioned was the supposed impossibility of infinity and continuity. in\\r\\nview of our earlier discussion of physics, it would seem that no\\r\\n_conclusive_ empirical evidence exists in favour of infinity or\\r\\ncontinuity in objects of sense or in matter. nevertheless, the\\r\\nexplanation which assumes infinity and continuity remains incomparably\\r\\neasier and more natural, from a scientific point of view, than any\\r\\nother, and since georg cantor has shown that the supposed contradictions\\r\\nare illusory, there is no longer any reason to struggle after a finitist\\r\\nexplanation of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe supposed difficulties of continuity all have their source in the\\r\\nfact that a continuous series must have an infinite number of terms, and\\r\\nare in fact difficulties concerning infinity. hence, in freeing the\\r\\ninfinite from contradiction, we are at the same time showing the logical\\r\\npossibility of continuity as assumed in science.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe kind of way in which infinity has been used to discredit the world\\r\\nof sense may be illustrated by kant\\'s first two antinomies. in the\\r\\nfirst, the thesis states: \"the world has a beginning in time, and as\\r\\nregards space is enclosed within limits\"; the antithesis states: \"the\\r\\nworld has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite in\\r\\nrespect of both time and space.\" kant professes to prove both these\\r\\npropositions, whereas, if what we have said on modern logic has any\\r\\ntruth, it must be impossible to prove either. in order, however, to\\r\\nrescue the world of sense, it is enough to destroy the proof of _one_ of\\r\\nthe two. for our present purpose, it is the proof that the world is\\r\\n_finite_ that interests us. kant\\'s argument as regards space here rests\\r\\nupon his argument as regards time. we need therefore only examine the\\r\\nargument as regards time. what he says is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"for let us assume that the world has no beginning as regards time, so\\r\\nthat up to every given instant an eternity has elapsed, and therefore an\\r\\ninfinite series of successive states of the things in the world has\\r\\npassed by. but the infinity of a series consists just in this, that it\\r\\ncan never be completed by successive synthesis. therefore an infinite\\r\\npast world-series is impossible, and accordingly a beginning of the\\r\\nworld is a necessary condition of its existence; which was the first\\r\\nthing to be proved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmany different criticisms might be passed on this argument, but we will\\r\\ncontent ourselves with a bare minimum. to begin with, it is a mistake to\\r\\ndefine the infinity of a series as \"impossibility of completion by\\r\\nsuccessive synthesis.\" the notion of infinity, as we shall see in the\\r\\nnext lecture, is primarily a property of _classes_, and only\\r\\nderivatively applicable to series; classes which are infinite are given\\r\\nall at once by the defining property of their members, so that there is\\r\\nno question of \"completion\" or of \"successive synthesis.\" and the word\\r\\n\"synthesis,\" by suggesting the mental activity of synthesising,\\r\\nintroduces, more or less surreptitiously, that reference to mind by\\r\\nwhich all kant\\'s philosophy was infected. in the second place, when kant\\r\\nsays that an infinite series can \"never\" be completed by successive\\r\\nsynthesis, all that he has even conceivably a right to say is that it\\r\\ncannot be completed _in a finite time_. thus what he really proves is,\\r\\nat most, that if the world had no beginning, it must have already\\r\\nexisted for an infinite time. this, however, is a very poor conclusion,\\r\\nby no means suitable for his purposes. and with this result we might, if\\r\\nwe chose, take leave of the first antinomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is worth while, however, to consider how kant came to make such an\\r\\nelementary blunder. what happened in his imagination was obviously\\r\\nsomething like this: starting from the present and going backwards in\\r\\ntime, we have, if the world had no beginning, an infinite series of\\r\\nevents. as we see from the word \"synthesis,\" he imagined a mind trying\\r\\nto grasp these successively, _in the reverse order_ to that in which\\r\\nthey had occurred, _i.e._ going from the present backwards. _this_\\r\\nseries is obviously one which has no end. but the series of events up to\\r\\nthe present has an end, since it ends with the present. owing to the\\r\\ninveterate subjectivism of his mental habits, he failed to notice that\\r\\nhe had reversed the sense of the series by substituting backward\\r\\nsynthesis for forward happening, and thus he supposed that it was\\r\\nnecessary to identify the mental series, which had no end, with the\\r\\nphysical series, which had an end but no beginning. it was this mistake,\\r\\ni think, which, operating unconsciously, led him to attribute validity\\r\\nto a singularly flimsy piece of fallacious reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second antinomy illustrates the dependence of the problem of\\r\\ncontinuity upon that of infinity. the thesis states: \"every complex\\r\\nsubstance in the world consists of simple parts, and there exists\\r\\neverywhere nothing but the simple or what is composed of it.\" the\\r\\nantithesis states: \"no complex thing in the world consists of simple\\r\\nparts, and everywhere in it there exists nothing simple.\" here, as\\r\\nbefore, the proofs of both thesis and antithesis are open to criticism,\\r\\nbut for the purpose of vindicating physics and the world of sense it is\\r\\nenough to find a fallacy in _one_ of the proofs. we will choose for this\\r\\npurpose the proof of the antithesis, which begins as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"assume that a complex thing (as substance) consists of simple parts.\\r\\nsince all external relation, and therefore all composition out of\\r\\nsubstances, is only possible in space, the space occupied by a complex\\r\\nthing must consist of as many parts as the thing consists of. now space\\r\\ndoes not consist of simple parts, but of spaces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rest of his argument need not concern us, for the nerve of the proof\\r\\nlies in the one statement: \"space does not consist of simple parts, but\\r\\nof spaces.\" this is like bergson\\'s objection to \"the absurd proposition\\r\\nthat motion is made up of immobilities.\" kant does not tell us why he\\r\\nholds that a space must consist of spaces rather than of simple parts.\\r\\ngeometry regards space as made up of points, which are simple; and\\r\\nalthough, as we have seen, this view is not scientifically or logically\\r\\n_necessary_, it remains _prima facie_ possible, and its mere possibility\\r\\nis enough to vitiate kant\\'s argument. for, if his proof of the thesis of\\r\\nthe antinomy were valid, and if the antithesis could only be avoided by\\r\\nassuming points, then the antinomy itself would afford a conclusive\\r\\nreason in favour of points. why, then, did kant think it impossible that\\r\\nspace should be composed of points?\\r\\n\\r\\ni think two considerations probably influenced him. in the first place,\\r\\nthe essential thing about space is spatial order, and mere points, by\\r\\nthemselves, will not account for spatial order. it is obvious that his\\r\\nargument assumes absolute space; but it is spatial _relations_ that are\\r\\nalone important, and they cannot be reduced to points. this ground for\\r\\nhis view depends, therefore, upon his ignorance of the logical theory of\\r\\norder and his oscillations between absolute and relative space. but\\r\\nthere is also another ground for his opinion, which is more relevant to\\r\\nour present topic. this is the ground derived from infinite\\r\\ndivisibility. a space may be halved, and then halved again, and so on\\r\\n_ad infinitum_, and at every stage of the process the parts are still\\r\\nspaces, not points. in order to reach points by such a method, it would\\r\\nbe necessary to come to the end of an unending process, which is\\r\\nimpossible. but just as an infinite class can be given all at once by\\r\\nits defining concept, though it cannot be reached by successive\\r\\nenumeration, so an infinite set of points can be given all at once as\\r\\nmaking up a line or area or volume, though they can never be reached by\\r\\nthe process of successive division. thus the infinite divisibility of\\r\\nspace gives no ground for denying that space is composed of points. kant\\r\\ndoes not give his grounds for this denial, and we can therefore only\\r\\nconjecture what they were. but the above two grounds, which we have seen\\r\\nto be fallacious, seem sufficient to account for his opinion, and we may\\r\\ntherefore conclude that the antithesis of the second antinomy is\\r\\nunproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above illustration of kant\\'s antinomies has only been introduced in\\r\\norder to show the relevance of the problem of infinity to the problem of\\r\\nthe reality of objects of sense. in the remainder of the present\\r\\nlecture, i wish to state and explain the problem of infinity, to show\\r\\nhow it arose, and to show the irrelevance of all the solutions proposed\\r\\nby philosophers. in the following lecture, i shall try to explain the\\r\\ntrue solution, which has been discovered by the mathematicians, but\\r\\nnevertheless belongs essentially to philosophy. the solution is\\r\\ndefinitive, in the sense that it entirely satisfies and convinces all\\r\\nwho study it carefully. for over two thousand years the human intellect\\r\\nwas baffled by the problem; its many failures and its ultimate success\\r\\nmake this problem peculiarly apt for the illustration of method.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem appears to have first arisen in some such way as the\\r\\nfollowing.[22] pythagoras and his followers, who were interested, like\\r\\ndescartes, in the application of number to geometry, adopted in that\\r\\nscience more arithmetical methods than those with which euclid has made\\r\\nus familiar. they, or their contemporaries the atomists, believed,\\r\\napparently, that space is composed of indivisible points, while time is\\r\\ncomposed of indivisible instants.[23] this belief would not, by itself,\\r\\nhave raised the difficulties which they encountered, but it was\\r\\npresumably accompanied by another belief, that the number of points in\\r\\nany finite area or of instants in any finite period must be finite. i do\\r\\nnot suppose that this latter belief was a conscious one, because\\r\\nprobably no other possibility had occurred to them. but the belief\\r\\nnevertheless operated, and very soon brought them into conflict with\\r\\nfacts which they themselves discovered. before explaining how this\\r\\noccurred, however, it is necessary to say one word in explanation of the\\r\\nphrase \"finite number.\" the _exact_ explanation is a matter for our next\\r\\nlecture; for the present, it must suffice to say that i mean 0 and 1 and\\r\\n2 and 3 and so on, for ever--in other words, any number that can be\\r\\nobtained by successively adding ones. this includes all the numbers that\\r\\ncan be expressed by means of our ordinary numerals, and since such\\r\\nnumbers can be made greater and greater, without ever reaching an\\r\\nunsurpassable maximum, it is easy to suppose that there are no other\\r\\nnumbers. but this supposition, natural as it is, is mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [22] in what concerns the early greek philosophers, my knowledge is\\r\\n  largely derived from burnet\\'s valuable work, _early greek philosophy_\\r\\n  (2nd ed., london, 1908). i have also been greatly assisted by mr d. s.\\r\\n  robertson of trinity college, who has supplied the deficiencies of my\\r\\n  knowledge of greek, and brought important references to my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [23] _cf._ aristotle, _metaphysics_, m. 6, 1080b, 18 _sqq._, and\\r\\n  1083b, 8 _sqq._\\r\\n\\r\\nwhether the pythagoreans themselves believed space and time to be\\r\\ncomposed of indivisible points and instants is a debatable question.[24]\\r\\nit would seem that the distinction between space and matter had not yet\\r\\nbeen clearly made, and that therefore, when an atomistic view is\\r\\nexpressed, it is difficult to decide whether particles of matter or\\r\\npoints of space are intended. there is an interesting passage[25] in\\r\\naristotle\\'s _physics_,[26] where he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the pythagoreans all maintained the existence of the void, and said\\r\\nthat it enters into the heaven itself from the boundless breath,\\r\\ninasmuch as the heaven breathes in the void also; and the void\\r\\ndifferentiates natures, as if it were a sort of separation of\\r\\nconsecutives, and as if it were their differentiation; and that this\\r\\nalso is what is first in numbers, for it is the void which\\r\\ndifferentiates them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [24] there is some reason to think that the pythagoreans distinguished\\r\\n  between discrete and continuous quantity. g. j. allman, in his _greek\\r\\n  geometry from thales to euclid_, says (p. 23): \"the pythagoreans made\\r\\n  a fourfold division of mathematical science, attributing one of its\\r\\n  parts to the how many, ~to poson~, and the other to the how much, ~to\\r\\n  pelikon~; and they assigned to each of these parts a twofold division.\\r\\n  for they said that discrete quantity, or the _how many_, either\\r\\n  subsists by itself or must be considered with relation to some other;\\r\\n  but that continued quantity, or the _how much_, is either stable or in\\r\\n  motion. hence they affirmed that arithmetic contemplates that discrete\\r\\n  quantity which subsists by itself, but music that which is related to\\r\\n  another; and that geometry considers continued quantity so far as it\\r\\n  is immovable; but astronomy (~ten sphairiken~) contemplates continued\\r\\n  quantity so far as it is of a self-motive nature. (proclus, ed.\\r\\n  friedlein, p. 35. as to the distinction between ~to pelikon~,\\r\\n  continuous, and ~to poson~, discrete quantity, see iambl., _in\\r\\n  nicomachi geraseni arithmeticam introductionem_, ed. tennulius,\\r\\n  p. 148.)\" _cf._ p. 48.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [25] referred to by burnet, _op. cit._, p. 120.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [26] iv., 6. 213b, 22; h. ritter and l. preller, _historia philosophiae\\r\\n  graecae_, 8th ed., gotha, 1898, p. 75 (this work will be referred to in\\r\\n  future as \"r. p.\").\\r\\n\\r\\nthis seems to imply that they regarded matter as consisting of atoms\\r\\nwith empty space in between. but if so, they must have thought space\\r\\ncould be studied by only paying attention to the atoms, for otherwise it\\r\\nwould be hard to account for their arithmetical methods in geometry, or\\r\\nfor their statement that \"things are numbers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difficulty which beset the pythagoreans in their attempts to apply\\r\\nnumbers arose through their discovery of incommensurables, and this, in\\r\\nturn, arose as follows. pythagoras, as we all learnt in youth,\\r\\ndiscovered the proposition that the sum of the squares on the sides of a\\r\\nright-angled triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse. it is\\r\\nsaid that he sacrificed an ox when he discovered this theorem; if so,\\r\\nthe ox was the first martyr to science. but the theorem, though it has\\r\\nremained his chief claim to immortality, was soon found to have a\\r\\nconsequence fatal to his whole philosophy. consider the case of a\\r\\nright-angled triangle whose two sides are equal, such a triangle as is\\r\\nformed by two sides of a square and a diagonal. here, in virtue of the\\r\\ntheorem, the square on the diagonal is double of the square on either of\\r\\nthe sides. but pythagoras or his early followers easily proved that the\\r\\nsquare of one whole number cannot be double of the square of\\r\\nanother.[27] thus the length of the side and the length of the diagonal\\r\\nare incommensurable; that is to say, however small a unit of length you\\r\\ntake, if it is contained an exact number of times in the side, it is not\\r\\ncontained any exact number of times in the diagonal, and _vice versa_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [27] the pythagorean proof is roughly as follows. if possible, let the\\r\\n  ratio of the diagonal to the side of a square be _m_/_n_, where _m_\\r\\n  and _n_ are whole numbers having no common factor. then we must have\\r\\n  _m_2 = 2_n_2. now the square of an odd number is odd, but _m_2, being\\r\\n  equal to 2_n_2, is even. hence _m_ must be even. but the square of an\\r\\n  even number divides by 4, therefore _n_2, which is half of _m_2, must\\r\\n  be even. therefore _n_ must be even. but, since _m_ is even, and _m_\\r\\n  and _n_ have no common factor, _n_ must be odd. thus _n_ must be both\\r\\n  odd and even, which is impossible; and therefore the diagonal and the\\r\\n  side cannot have a rational ratio.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow this fact might have been assimilated by some philosophies without\\r\\nany great difficulty, but to the philosophy of pythagoras it was\\r\\nabsolutely fatal. pythagoras held that number is the constitutive\\r\\nessence of all things, yet no two numbers could express the ratio of the\\r\\nside of a square to the diagonal. it would seem probable that we may\\r\\nexpand his difficulty, without departing from his thought, by assuming\\r\\nthat he regarded the length of a line as determined by the number of\\r\\natoms contained in it--a line two inches long would contain twice as\\r\\nmany atoms as a line one inch long, and so on. but if this were the\\r\\ntruth, then there must be a definite numerical ratio between any two\\r\\nfinite lengths, because it was supposed that the number of atoms in\\r\\neach, however large, must be finite. here there was an insoluble\\r\\ncontradiction. the pythagoreans, it is said, resolved to keep the\\r\\nexistence of incommensurables a profound secret, revealed only to a few\\r\\nof the supreme heads of the sect; and one of their number, hippasos of\\r\\nmetapontion, is even said to have been shipwrecked at sea for impiously\\r\\ndisclosing the terrible discovery to their enemies. it must be\\r\\nremembered that pythagoras was the founder of a new religion as well as\\r\\nthe teacher of a new science: if the science came to be doubted, the\\r\\ndisciples might fall into sin, and perhaps even eat beans, which\\r\\naccording to pythagoras is as bad as eating parents\\' bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem first raised by the discovery of incommensurables proved, as\\r\\ntime went on, to be one of the most severe and at the same time most\\r\\nfar-reaching problems that have confronted the human intellect in its\\r\\nendeavour to understand the world. it showed at once that numerical\\r\\nmeasurement of lengths, if it was to be made accurate, must require an\\r\\narithmetic more advanced and more difficult than any that the ancients\\r\\npossessed. they therefore set to work to reconstruct geometry on a basis\\r\\nwhich did not assume the universal possibility of numerical\\r\\nmeasurement--a reconstruction which, as may be seen in euclid, they\\r\\neffected with extraordinary skill and with great logical acumen. the\\r\\nmoderns, under the influence of cartesian geometry, have reasserted the\\r\\nuniversal possibility of numerical measurement, extending arithmetic,\\r\\npartly for that purpose, so as to include what are called \"irrational\"\\r\\nnumbers, which give the ratios of incommensurable lengths. but although\\r\\nirrational numbers have long been used without a qualm, it is only in\\r\\nquite recent years that logically satisfactory definitions of them have\\r\\nbeen given. with these definitions, the first and most obvious form of\\r\\nthe difficulty which confronted the pythagoreans has been solved; but\\r\\nother forms of the difficulty remain to be considered, and it is these\\r\\nthat introduce us to the problem of infinity in its pure form.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe saw that, accepting the view that a length is composed of points, the\\r\\nexistence of incommensurables proves that every finite length must\\r\\ncontain an infinite number of points. in other words, if we were to take\\r\\naway points one by one, we should never have taken away all the points,\\r\\nhowever long we continued the process. the number of points, therefore,\\r\\ncannot be _counted_, for counting is a process which enumerates things\\r\\none by one. the property of being unable to be counted is characteristic\\r\\nof infinite collections, and is a source of many of their paradoxical\\r\\nqualities. so paradoxical are these qualities that until our own day\\r\\nthey were thought to constitute logical contradictions. a long line of\\r\\nphilosophers, from zeno[28] to m. bergson, have based much of their\\r\\nmetaphysics upon the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.\\r\\nbroadly speaking, the difficulties were stated by zeno, and nothing\\r\\nmaterial was added until we reach bolzano\\'s _paradoxien des\\r\\nunendlichen_, a little work written in 1847-8, and published\\r\\nposthumously in 1851. intervening attempts to deal with the problem are\\r\\nfutile and negligible. the definitive solution of the difficulties is\\r\\ndue, not to bolzano, but to georg cantor, whose work on this subject\\r\\nfirst appeared in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [28] in regard to zeno and the pythagoreans, i have derived much\\r\\n  valuable information and criticism from mr p. e. b. jourdain.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to understand zeno, and to realise how little modern orthodox\\r\\nmetaphysics has added to the achievements of the greeks, we must\\r\\nconsider for a moment his master parmenides, in whose interest the\\r\\nparadoxes were invented.[29] parmenides expounded his views in a poem\\r\\ndivided into two parts, called \"the way of truth\" and \"the way of\\r\\nopinion\"--like mr bradley\\'s \"appearance\" and \"reality,\" except that\\r\\nparmenides tells us first about reality and then about appearance. \"the\\r\\nway of opinion,\" in his philosophy, is, broadly speaking,\\r\\npythagoreanism; it begins with a warning: \"here i shall close my\\r\\ntrustworthy speech and thought about the truth. henceforward learn the\\r\\nopinions of mortals, giving ear to the deceptive ordering of my words.\"\\r\\nwhat has gone before has been revealed by a goddess, who tells him what\\r\\nreally _is_. reality, she says, is uncreated, indestructible,\\r\\nunchanging, indivisible; it is \"immovable in the bonds of mighty chains,\\r\\nwithout beginning and without end; since coming into being and passing\\r\\naway have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them away.\" the\\r\\nfundamental principle of his inquiry is stated in a sentence which would\\r\\nnot be out of place in hegel:[30] \"thou canst not know what is not--that\\r\\nis impossible--nor utter it; for it is the same thing that can be\\r\\nthought and that can be.\" and again: \"it needs must be that what can be\\r\\nthought and spoken of is; for it is possible for it to be, and it is not\\r\\npossible for what is nothing to be.\" the impossibility of change follows\\r\\nfrom this principle; for what is past can be spoken of, and therefore,\\r\\nby the principle, still is.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [29] so plato makes zeno say in the _parmenides_, apropos of his\\r\\n  philosophy as a whole; and all internal and external evidence supports\\r\\n  this view.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [30] \"with parmenides,\" hegel says, \"philosophising proper began.\"\\r\\n  _werke_ (edition of 1840), vol. xiii. p. 274.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe great conception of a reality behind the passing illusions of sense,\\r\\na reality one, indivisible, and unchanging, was thus introduced into\\r\\nwestern philosophy by parmenides, not, it would seem, for mystical or\\r\\nreligious reasons, but on the basis of a logical argument as to the\\r\\nimpossibility of not-being. all the great metaphysical systems--notably\\r\\nthose of plato, spinoza, and hegel--are the outcome of this fundamental\\r\\nidea. it is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this\\r\\nview. the contention that time is unreal and that the world of sense is\\r\\nillusory must, i think, be regarded as based upon fallacious reasoning.\\r\\nnevertheless, there is some sense--easier to feel than to state--in\\r\\nwhich time is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of reality.\\r\\npast and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the present, and a\\r\\ncertain emancipation from slavery to time is essential to philosophic\\r\\nthought. the importance of time is rather practical than theoretical,\\r\\nrather in relation to our desires than in relation to truth. a truer\\r\\nimage of the world, i think, is obtained by picturing things as entering\\r\\ninto the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view\\r\\nwhich regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is. both in\\r\\nthought and in feeling, to realise the unimportance of time is the gate\\r\\nof wisdom. but unimportance is not unreality; and therefore what we\\r\\nshall have to say about zeno\\'s arguments in support of parmenides must\\r\\nbe mainly critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe relation of zeno to parmenides is explained by plato[31] in the\\r\\ndialogue in which socrates, as a young man, learns logical acumen and\\r\\nphilosophic disinterestedness from their dialectic. i quote from\\r\\njowett\\'s translation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i see, parmenides, said socrates, that zeno is your second self in his\\r\\nwritings too; he puts what you say in another way, and would fain\\r\\ndeceive us into believing that he is telling us what is new. for you, in\\r\\nyour poems, say all is one, and of this you adduce excellent proofs; and\\r\\nhe on the other hand says there is no many; and on behalf of this he\\r\\noffers overwhelming evidence. to deceive the world, as you have done, by\\r\\nsaying the same thing in different ways, one of you affirming the one,\\r\\nand the other denying the many, is a strain of art beyond the reach of\\r\\nmost of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"yes, socrates, said zeno. but although you are as keen as a spartan\\r\\nhound in pursuing the track, you do not quite apprehend the true motive\\r\\nof the composition, which is not really such an ambitious work as you\\r\\nimagine; for what you speak of was an accident; i had no serious\\r\\nintention of deceiving the world. the truth is, that these writings of\\r\\nmine were meant to protect the arguments of parmenides against those who\\r\\nscoff at him and show the many ridiculous and contradictory results\\r\\nwhich they suppose to follow from the affirmation of the one. my answer\\r\\nis an address to the partisans of the many, whose attack i return with\\r\\ninterest by retorting upon them that their hypothesis of the being of\\r\\nthe many if carried out appears in a still more ridiculous light than\\r\\nthe hypothesis of the being of the one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [31] _parmenides_, 128 a-d.\\r\\n\\r\\nzeno\\'s four arguments against motion were intended to exhibit the\\r\\ncontradictions that result from supposing that there is such a thing as\\r\\nchange, and thus to support the parmenidean doctrine that reality is\\r\\nunchanging.[32] unfortunately, we only know his arguments through\\r\\naristotle,[33] who stated them in order to refute them. those\\r\\nphilosophers in the present day who have had their doctrines stated by\\r\\nopponents will realise that a just or adequate presentation of zeno\\'s\\r\\nposition is hardly to be expected from aristotle; but by some care in\\r\\ninterpretation it seems possible to reconstruct the so-called \"sophisms\"\\r\\nwhich have been \"refuted\" by every tyro from that day to this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [32] this interpretation is combated by milhaud, _les\\r\\n  philosophes-geometres de la grece_, p. 140 n., but his reasons do not\\r\\n  seem to me convincing. all the interpretations in what follows are\\r\\n  open to question, but all have the support of reputable authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [33] _physics_, vi. 9. 2396 (r.p. 136-139).\\r\\n\\r\\nzeno\\'s arguments would seem to be \"ad hominem\"; that is to say, they\\r\\nseem to assume premisses granted by his opponents, and to show that,\\r\\ngranting these premisses, it is possible to deduce consequences which\\r\\nhis opponents must deny. in order to decide whether they are valid\\r\\narguments or \"sophisms,\" it is necessary to guess at the tacit\\r\\npremisses, and to decide who was the \"homo\" at whom they were aimed.\\r\\nsome maintain that they were aimed at the pythagoreans,[34] while others\\r\\nhave held that they were intended to refute the atomists.[35] m.\\r\\nevellin, on the contrary, holds that they constitute a refutation of\\r\\ninfinite divisibility,[36] while m. g. noel, in the interests of hegel,\\r\\nmaintains that the first two arguments refute infinite divisibility,\\r\\nwhile the next two refute indivisibles.[37] amid such a bewildering\\r\\nvariety of interpretations, we can at least not complain of any\\r\\nrestrictions on our liberty of choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [34] _cf._ gaston milhaud, _les philosophes-geometres de la grece_,\\r\\n  p. 140 n.;

and that as\\r\\nagainst the view that a finite stretch of space or time consists of a\\r\\nfinite number of points and instants, his arguments are not sophisms,\\r\\nbut perfectly valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe conclusion which zeno wishes us to draw is that plurality is a\\r\\ndelusion, and spaces and times are really indivisible. the other\\r\\nconclusion which is possible, namely, that the number of points and\\r\\ninstants is infinite, was not tenable so long as the infinite was\\r\\ninfected with contradictions. in a fragment which is not one of the four\\r\\nfamous arguments against motion, zeno says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"if things are a many, they must be just as many as they are, and\\r\\nneither more nor less. now, if they are as many as they are, they will\\r\\nbe finite in number.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"if things are a many, they will be infinite in number; for there will\\r\\nalways be other things between them, and others again between these. and\\r\\nso things are infinite in number.\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [39] simplicius, _phys._, 140, 28 d (r.p. 133); burnet, _op. cit._,\\r\\n  pp. 364-365.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis argument attempts to prove that, if there are many things, the\\r\\nnumber of them must be both finite and infinite, which is impossible;\\r\\nhence we are to conclude that there is only one thing. but the weak\\r\\npoint in the argument is the phrase: \"if they are just as many as they\\r\\nare, they will be finite in number.\" this phrase is not very clear, but\\r\\nit is plain that it assumes the impossibility of definite infinite\\r\\nnumbers. without this assumption, which is now known to be false, the\\r\\narguments of zeno, though they suffice (on certain very reasonable\\r\\nassumptions) to dispel the hypothesis of finite indivisibles, do not\\r\\nsuffice to prove that motion and change and plurality are impossible.\\r\\nthey are not, however, on any view, mere foolish quibbles: they are\\r\\nserious arguments, raising difficulties which it has taken two thousand\\r\\nyears to answer, and which even now are fatal to the teachings of most\\r\\nphilosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first of zeno\\'s arguments is the argument of the race-course, which\\r\\nis paraphrased by burnet as follows:[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"you cannot get to the end of a race-course. you cannot traverse an\\r\\ninfinite number of points in a finite time. you must traverse the half\\r\\nof any given distance before you traverse the whole, and the half of\\r\\nthat again before you can traverse it. this goes on _ad infinitum_, so\\r\\nthat there are an infinite number of points in any given space, and you\\r\\ncannot touch an infinite number one by one in a finite time.\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [40] _op. cit._, p. 367.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [41] aristotle\\'s words are: \"the first is the one on the non-existence\\r\\n  of motion on the ground that what is moved must always attain the\\r\\n  middle point sooner than the end-point, on which we gave our opinion\\r\\n  in the earlier part of our discourse.\" _phys._, vi. 9. 939b (r.p.\\r\\n  136). aristotle seems to refer to _phys._, vi. 2. 223ab [r.p. 136a]:\\r\\n  \"all space is continuous, for time and space are divided into the same\\r\\n  and equal divisions.... wherefore also zeno\\'s argument is fallacious,\\r\\n  that it is impossible to go through an infinite collection or to touch\\r\\n  an infinite collection one by one in a finite time. for there are two\\r\\n  senses in which the term \\'infinite\\' is applied both to length and to\\r\\n  time, and in fact to all continuous things, either in regard to\\r\\n  divisibility, or in regard to the ends. now it is not possible to\\r\\n  touch things infinite in regard to number in a finite time, but it is\\r\\n  possible to touch things infinite in regard to divisibility: for time\\r\\n  itself also is infinite in this sense. so that in fact we go through\\r\\n  an infinite, [space] in an infinite [time] and not in a finite [time],\\r\\n  and we touch infinite things with infinite things, not with finite\\r\\n  things.\" philoponus, a sixth-century commentator (r.p. 136a, _exc.\\r\\n  paris philop. in arist. phys._, 803, 2. vit.), gives the following\\r\\n  illustration: \"for if a thing were moved the space of a cubit in one\\r\\n  hour, since in every space there are an infinite number of points, the\\r\\n  thing moved must needs touch all the points of the space: it will then\\r\\n  go through an infinite collection in a finite time, which is\\r\\n  impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nzeno appeals here, in the first place, to the fact that any distance,\\r\\nhowever small, can be halved. from this it follows, of course, that\\r\\nthere must be an infinite number of points in a line. but, aristotle\\r\\nrepresents him as arguing, you cannot touch an infinite number of points\\r\\n_one by one_ in a finite time. the words \"one by one\" are important. (1)\\r\\nif _all_ the points touched are concerned, then, though you pass through\\r\\nthem continuously, you do not touch them \"one by one.\" that is to say,\\r\\nafter touching one, there is not another which you touch next: no two\\r\\npoints are next each other, but between any two there are always an\\r\\ninfinite number of others, which cannot be enumerated one by one. (2)\\r\\nif, on the other hand, only the successive middle points are concerned,\\r\\nobtained by always halving what remains of the course, then the points\\r\\nare reached one by one, and, though they are infinite in number, they\\r\\nare in fact all reached in a finite time. his argument to the contrary\\r\\nmay be supposed to appeal to the view that a finite time must consist of\\r\\na finite number of instants, in which case what he says would be\\r\\nperfectly true on the assumption that the possibility of continued\\r\\ndichotomy is undeniable. if, on the other hand, we suppose the argument\\r\\ndirected against the partisans of infinite divisibility, we must suppose\\r\\nit to proceed as follows:[42] \"the points given by successive halving of\\r\\nthe distances still to be traversed are infinite in number, and are\\r\\nreached in succession, each being reached a finite time later than its\\r\\npredecessor; but the sum of an infinite number of finite times must be\\r\\ninfinite, and therefore the process will never be completed.\" it is very\\r\\npossible that this is historically the right interpretation, but in this\\r\\nform the argument is invalid. if half the course takes half a minute,\\r\\nand the next quarter takes a quarter of a minute, and so on, the whole\\r\\ncourse will take a minute. the apparent force of the argument, on this\\r\\ninterpretation, lies solely in the mistaken supposition that there\\r\\ncannot be anything beyond the whole of an infinite series, which can be\\r\\nseen to be false by observing that 1 is beyond the whole of the infinite\\r\\nseries 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, ...\\r\\n\\r\\n  [42] _cf._ mr c. d. broad, \"note on achilles and the tortoise,\"\\r\\n  _mind_, n.s., vol. xxii. pp. 318-9.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second of zeno\\'s arguments is the one concerning achilles and the\\r\\ntortoise, which has achieved more notoriety than the others. it is\\r\\nparaphrased by burnet as follows:[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"achilles will never overtake the tortoise. he must first reach the\\r\\nplace from which the tortoise started. by that time the tortoise will\\r\\nhave got some way ahead. achilles must then make up that, and again the\\r\\ntortoise will be ahead. he is always coming nearer, but he never makes\\r\\nup to it.\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [43] _op. cit._\\r\\n\\r\\n  [44] aristotle\\'s words are: \"the second is the so-called achilles. it\\r\\n  consists in this, that the slower will never be overtaken in its\\r\\n  course by the quickest, for the pursuer must always come first to the\\r\\n  point from which the pursued has just departed, so that the slower\\r\\n  must necessarily be always still more or less in advance.\" _phys._,\\r\\n  vi. 9. 239b (r.p. 137).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis argument is essentially the same as the previous one. it shows\\r\\nthat, if achilles ever overtakes the tortoise, it must be after an\\r\\ninfinite number of instants have elapsed since he started. this is in\\r\\nfact true; but the view that an infinite number of instants make up an\\r\\ninfinitely long time is not true, and therefore the conclusion that\\r\\nachilles will never overtake the tortoise does not follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe third argument,[45] that of the arrow, is very interesting. the text\\r\\nhas been questioned. burnet accepts the alterations of zeller, and\\r\\nparaphrases thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the arrow in flight is at rest. for, if everything is at rest when it\\r\\noccupies a space equal to itself, and what is in flight at any given\\r\\nmoment always occupies a space equal to itself, it cannot move.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [45] _phys._, vi. 9. 239b (r.p. 138).\\r\\n\\r\\nbut according to prantl, the literal translation of the unemended text\\r\\nof aristotle\\'s statement of the argument is as follows: \"if everything,\\r\\nwhen it is behaving in a uniform manner, is continually either moving or\\r\\nat rest, but what is moving is always in the _now_, then the moving\\r\\narrow is motionless.\" this form of the argument brings out its force\\r\\nmore clearly than burnet\\'s paraphrase.\\r\\n\\r\\nhere, if not in the first two arguments, the view that a finite part of\\r\\ntime consists of a finite series of successive instants seems to be\\r\\nassumed; at any rate the plausibility of the argument seems to depend\\r\\nupon supposing that there are consecutive instants. throughout an\\r\\ninstant, it is said, a moving body is where it is: it cannot move during\\r\\nthe instant, for that would require that the instant should have parts.\\r\\nthus, suppose we consider a period consisting of a thousand instants,\\r\\nand suppose the arrow is in flight throughout this period. at each of\\r\\nthe thousand instants, the arrow is where it is, though at the next\\r\\ninstant it is somewhere else. it is never moving, but in some miraculous\\r\\nway the change of position has to occur _between_ the instants, that is\\r\\nto say, not at any time whatever. this is what m. bergson calls the\\r\\ncinematographic representation of reality. the more the difficulty is\\r\\nmeditated, the more real it becomes. the solution lies in the theory of\\r\\ncontinuous series: we find it hard to avoid supposing that, when the\\r\\narrow is in flight, there is a _next_ position occupied at the _next_\\r\\nmoment; but in fact there is no next position and no next moment, and\\r\\nwhen once this is imaginatively realised, the difficulty is seen to\\r\\ndisappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fourth and last of zeno\\'s arguments is[46] the argument of the\\r\\nstadium.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [46] _phys._, vi. 9. 239b (r.p. 139).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe argument as stated by burnet is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  first position.  second position.\\r\\n      a ....           a  ....\\r\\n      b ....           b ....\\r\\n      c ....           c   ....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"half the time may be equal to double the time. let us suppose three\\r\\nrows of bodies, one of which (a) is at rest while the other two (b, c)\\r\\nare moving with equal velocity in opposite directions. by the time they\\r\\nare all in the same part of the course, b will have passed twice as many\\r\\nof the bodies in c as in a. therefore the time which it takes to pass c\\r\\nis twice as long as the time it takes to pass a. but the time which b\\r\\nand c take to reach the position of a is the same. therefore double the\\r\\ntime is equal to the half.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ngaye[47] devoted an interesting article to the interpretation of this\\r\\nargument. his translation of aristotle\\'s statement is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the fourth argument is that concerning the two rows of bodies, each row\\r\\nbeing composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each\\r\\nother on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite\\r\\ndirections, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal\\r\\nand the middle point of the course, and the other that between the\\r\\nmiddle point and the starting-post. this, he thinks, involves the\\r\\nconclusion that half a given time is equal to double the time. the\\r\\nfallacy of the reasoning lies in the assumption that a body occupies an\\r\\nequal time in passing with equal velocity a body that is in motion and a\\r\\nbody of equal size that is at rest, an assumption which is false. for\\r\\ninstance (so runs the argument), let a a ... be the stationary bodies of\\r\\nequal size, b b ... the bodies, equal in number and in size to a a ...,\\r\\noriginally occupying the half of the course from the starting-post to\\r\\nthe middle of the a\\'s, and c c ... those originally occupying the other\\r\\nhalf from the goal to the middle of the a\\'s, equal in number, size, and\\r\\nvelocity, to b b ... then three consequences follow. first, as the b\\'s\\r\\nand c\\'s pass one another, the first b reaches the last c at the same\\r\\nmoment at which the first c reaches the last b. secondly, at this moment\\r\\nthe first c has passed all the a\\'s, whereas the first b has passed only\\r\\nhalf the a\\'s and has consequently occupied only half the time occupied\\r\\nby the first c, since each of the two occupies an equal time in passing\\r\\neach a. thirdly, at the same moment all the b\\'s have passed all the c\\'s:\\r\\nfor the first c and the first b will simultaneously reach the opposite\\r\\nends of the course, since (so says zeno) the time occupied by the first\\r\\nc in passing each of the b\\'s is equal to that occupied by it in passing\\r\\neach of the a\\'s, because an equal time is occupied by both the first b\\r\\nand the first c in passing all the a\\'s. this is the argument: but it\\r\\npresupposes the aforesaid fallacious assumption.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [47] _loc. cit._\\r\\n\\r\\n  first position.     second position.\\r\\n  b  b\\' b\"              b  b\\' b\"\\r\\n  .  .  .

is not quite easy to follow, and it is only valid as\\r\\nagainst the assumption that a finite time consists of a finite number of\\r\\ninstants. we may re-state it in different language. let us suppose three\\r\\ndrill-sergeants, a, a\\', and a\", standing in a row, while the two files\\r\\nof soldiers march past them in opposite directions. at the first moment\\r\\nwhich we consider, the three men b, b\\', b\" in one row, and the three men\\r\\nc, c\\', c\" in the other row, are respectively opposite to a, a\\', and a\".\\r\\nat the very next moment, each row has moved on, and now b and c\" are\\r\\nopposite a\\'. thus b and c\" are opposite each other. when, then, did b\\r\\npass c\\'? it must have been somewhere between the two moments which we\\r\\nsupposed consecutive, and therefore the two moments cannot really have\\r\\nbeen consecutive. it follows that there must be other moments between\\r\\nany two given moments, and therefore that there must be an infinite\\r\\nnumber of moments in any given interval of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above difficulty, that b must have passed c\\' at some time between\\r\\ntwo consecutive moments, is a genuine one, but is not precisely the\\r\\ndifficulty raised by zeno. what zeno professes to prove is that \"half of\\r\\na given time is equal to double that time.\" the most intelligible\\r\\nexplanation of the argument known to me is that of gaye.[48] since,\\r\\nhowever, his explanation is not easy to set forth shortly, i will\\r\\nre-state what seems to me to be the logical essence of zeno\\'s\\r\\ncontention. if we suppose that time consists of a series of consecutive\\r\\ninstants, and that motion consists in passing through a series of\\r\\nconsecutive points, then the fastest possible motion is one which, at\\r\\neach instant, is at a point consecutive to that at which it was at the\\r\\nprevious instant. any slower motion must be one which has intervals of\\r\\nrest interspersed, and any faster motion must wholly omit some points.\\r\\nall this is evident from the fact that we cannot have more than one\\r\\nevent for each instant. but now, in the case of our a\\'s and b\\'s and c\\'s,\\r\\nb is opposite a fresh a every instant, and therefore the number of a\\'s\\r\\npassed gives the number of instants since the beginning of the motion.\\r\\nbut during the motion b has passed twice as many c\\'s, and yet cannot\\r\\nhave passed more than one each instant. hence the number of instants\\r\\nsince the motion began is twice the number of a\\'s passed, though we\\r\\npreviously found it was equal to this number. from this result, zeno\\'s\\r\\nconclusion follows.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [48] _loc. cit._, p. 105.\\r\\n\\r\\nzeno\\'s arguments, in some form, have afforded grounds for almost all the\\r\\ntheories of space and time and infinity which have been constructed from\\r\\nhis day to our own. we have seen that all his arguments are valid (with\\r\\ncertain reasonable hypotheses) on the assumption that finite spaces and\\r\\ntimes consist of a finite number of points and instants, and that the\\r\\nthird and fourth almost certainly in fact proceeded on this assumption,\\r\\nwhile the first and second, which were perhaps intended to refute the\\r\\nopposite assumption, were in that case fallacious. we may therefore\\r\\nescape from his paradoxes either by maintaining that, though space and\\r\\ntime do consist of points and instants, the number of them in any finite\\r\\ninterval is infinite; or by denying that space and time consist of\\r\\npoints and instants at all; or lastly, by denying the reality of space\\r\\nand time altogether. it would seem that zeno himself, as a supporter of\\r\\nparmenides, drew the last of these three possible deductions, at any\\r\\nrate in regard to time. in this a very large number of philosophers have\\r\\nfollowed him. many others, like m. bergson, have preferred to deny that\\r\\nspace and time consist of points and instants. either of these solutions\\r\\nwill meet the difficulties in the form in which zeno raised them. but,\\r\\nas we saw, the difficulties can also be met if infinite numbers are\\r\\nadmissible. and on grounds which are independent of space and time,\\r\\ninfinite numbers, and series in which no two terms are consecutive, must\\r\\nin any case be admitted. consider, for example, all the fractions less\\r\\nthan 1, arranged in order of magnitude. between any two of them, there\\r\\nare others, for example, the arithmetical mean of the two. thus no two\\r\\nfractions are consecutive, and the total number of them is infinite. it\\r\\nwill be found that much of what zeno says as regards the series of\\r\\npoints on a line can be equally well applied to the series of fractions.\\r\\nand we cannot deny that there are fractions, so that two of the above\\r\\nways of escape are closed to us. it follows that, if we are to solve the\\r\\nwhole class of difficulties derivable from zeno\\'s by analogy, we must\\r\\ndiscover some tenable theory of infinite numbers. what, then, are the\\r\\ndifficulties which, until the last thirty years, led philosophers to the\\r\\nbelief that infinite numbers are impossible?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difficulties of infinity are of two kinds, of which the first may be\\r\\ncalled sham, while the others involve, for their solution, a certain\\r\\namount of new and not altogether easy thinking. the sham difficulties\\r\\nare those suggested by the etymology, and those suggested by confusion\\r\\nof the mathematical infinite with what philosophers impertinently call\\r\\nthe \"true\" infinite. etymologically, \"infinite\" should mean \"having no\\r\\nend.\" but in fact some infinite series have ends, some have not; while\\r\\nsome collections are infinite without being serial, and can therefore\\r\\nnot properly be regarded as either endless or having ends. the series of\\r\\ninstants from any earlier one to any later one (both included) is\\r\\ninfinite, but has two ends; the series of instants from the beginning of\\r\\ntime to the present moment has one end, but is infinite. kant, in his\\r\\nfirst antinomy, seems to hold that it is harder for the past to be\\r\\ninfinite than for the future to be so, on the ground that the past is\\r\\nnow completed, and that nothing infinite can be completed. it is very\\r\\ndifficult to see how he can have imagined that there was any sense in\\r\\nthis remark; but it seems most probable that he was thinking of the\\r\\ninfinite as the \"unended.\" it is odd that he did not see that the future\\r\\ntoo has one end at the present, and is precisely on a level with the\\r\\npast. his regarding the two as different in this respect illustrates\\r\\njust that kind of slavery to time which, as we agreed in speaking of\\r\\nparmenides, the true philosopher must learn to leave behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe confusions introduced into the notions of philosophers by the\\r\\nso-called \"true\" infinite are curious. they see that this notion is not\\r\\nthe same as the mathematical infinite, but they choose to believe that\\r\\nit is the notion which the mathematicians are vainly trying to reach.\\r\\nthey therefore inform the mathematicians, kindly but firmly, that they\\r\\nare mistaken in adhering to the \"false\" infinite, since plainly the\\r\\n\"true\" infinite is something quite different. the reply to this is that\\r\\nwhat they call the \"true\" infinite is a notion totally irrelevant to the\\r\\nproblem of the mathematical infinite, to which it has only a fanciful\\r\\nand verbal analogy. so remote is it that i do not propose to confuse the\\r\\nissue by even mentioning what the \"true\" infinite is. it is the \"false\"\\r\\ninfinite that concerns us, and we have to show that the epithet \"false\"\\r\\nis undeserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are, however, certain genuine difficulties in understanding the\\r\\ninfinite, certain habits of mind derived from the consideration of\\r\\nfinite numbers, and easily extended to infinite numbers under the\\r\\nmistaken notion that they represent logical necessities. for example,\\r\\nevery number that we are accustomed to, except 0, has another number\\r\\nimmediately before it, from which it results by adding 1; but the first\\r\\ninfinite number does not have this property. the numbers before it form\\r\\nan infinite series, containing all the ordinary finite numbers, having\\r\\nno maximum, no last finite number, after which one little step would\\r\\nplunge us into the infinite. if it is assumed that the first infinite\\r\\nnumber is reached by a succession of small steps, it is easy to show\\r\\nthat it is self-contradictory. the first infinite number is, in fact,\\r\\nbeyond the whole unending series of finite numbers. \"but,\" it will be\\r\\nsaid, \"there cannot be anything beyond the whole of an unending series.\"\\r\\nthis, we may point out, is the very principle upon which zeno relies in\\r\\nthe arguments of the race-course and the achilles. take the race-course:\\r\\nthere is the moment when the runner still has half his distance to run,\\r\\nthen the moment when he still has a quarter, then when he still has an\\r\\neighth, and so on in a strictly unending series. beyond the whole of\\r\\nthis series is the moment when he reaches the goal. thus there certainly\\r\\ncan be something beyond the whole of an unending series. but it remains\\r\\nto show that this fact is only what might have been expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difficulty, like most of the vaguer difficulties besetting the\\r\\nmathematical infinite, is derived, i think, from the more or less\\r\\nunconscious operation of the idea of _counting_. if you set to work to\\r\\ncount the terms in an infinite collection, you will never have completed\\r\\nyour task. thus, in the case of the runner, if half, three-quarters,\\r\\nseven-eighths, and so on of the course were marked, and the runner was\\r\\nnot allowed to pass any of the marks until the umpire said \"now,\" then\\r\\nzeno\\'s conclusion would be true in practice, and he would never reach\\r\\nthe goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut it is not essential to the existence of a collection, or even to\\r\\nknowledge and reasoning concerning it, that we should be able to pass\\r\\nits terms in review one by one. this may be seen in the case of finite\\r\\ncollections; we can speak of \"mankind\" or \"the human race,\" though many\\r\\nof the individuals in this collection are not personally known to us. we\\r\\ncan do this because we know of various characteristics which every\\r\\nindividual has if he belongs to the collection, and not if he does not.\\r\\nand exactly the same happens in the case of infinite collections: they\\r\\nmay be known by their characteristics although their terms cannot be\\r\\nenumerated. in this sense, an unending series may nevertheless form a\\r\\nwhole, and there may be new terms beyond the whole of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome purely arithmetical peculiarities of infinite numbers have also\\r\\ncaused perplexity. for instance, an infinite number is not increased by\\r\\nadding one to it, or by doubling it. such peculiarities have seemed to\\r\\nmany to contradict logic, but in fact they only contradict confirmed\\r\\nmental habits. the whole difficulty of the subject lies in the necessity\\r\\nof thinking in an unfamiliar way, and in realising that many properties\\r\\nwhich we have thought inherent in number are in fact peculiar to finite\\r\\nnumbers. if this is remembered, the positive theory of infinity, which\\r\\nwill occupy the next lecture, will not be found so difficult as it is to\\r\\nthose who cling obstinately to the prejudices instilled by the\\r\\narithmetic which is learnt in childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture vii\\r\\n\\r\\nthe positive theory of infinity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe positive theory of infinity, and the general theory of number to\\r\\nwhich it has given rise, are among the triumphs of scientific method in\\r\\nphilosophy, and are therefore specially suitable for illustrating the\\r\\nlogical-analytic character of that method. the work in this subject has\\r\\nbeen done by mathematicians, and its results can be expressed in\\r\\nmathematical symbolism. why, then, it may be said, should the subject be\\r\\nregarded as philosophy rather than as mathematics? this raises a\\r\\ndifficult question, partly concerned with the use of words, but partly\\r\\nalso of real importance in understanding the function of philosophy.\\r\\nevery subject-matter, it would seem, can give rise to philosophical\\r\\ninvestigations as well as to the appropriate science, the difference\\r\\nbetween the two treatments being in the direction of movement and in the\\r\\nkind of truths which it is sought to establish. in the special sciences,\\r\\nwhen they have become fully developed, the movement is forward and\\r\\nsynthetic, from the simpler to the more complex. but in philosophy we\\r\\nfollow the inverse direction: from the complex and relatively concrete\\r\\nwe proceed towards the simple and abstract by means of analysis,\\r\\nseeking, in the process, to eliminate the particularity of the original\\r\\nsubject-matter, and to confine our attention entirely to the logical\\r\\n_form_ of the facts concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nbetween philosophy and pure mathematics there is a certain affinity, in\\r\\nthe fact that both are general and _a priori_. neither of them asserts\\r\\npropositions which, like those of history and geography, depend upon the\\r\\nactual concrete facts being just what they are. we may illustrate this\\r\\ncharacteristic by means of leibniz\\'s conception of many _possible_\\r\\nworlds, of which one only is _actual_. in all the many possible worlds,\\r\\nphilosophy and mathematics will be the same; the differences will only\\r\\nbe in respect of those particular facts which are chronicled by the\\r\\ndescriptive sciences. any quality, therefore, by which our actual world\\r\\nis distinguished from other abstractly possible worlds, must be ignored\\r\\nby mathematics and philosophy alike. mathematics and philosophy differ,\\r\\nhowever, in their manner of treating the general properties in which all\\r\\npossible worlds agree; for while mathematics, starting from\\r\\ncomparatively simple propositions, seeks to build up more and more\\r\\ncomplex results by deductive synthesis, philosophy, starting from data\\r\\nwhich are common knowledge, seeks to purify and generalise them into the\\r\\nsimplest statements of abstract form that can be obtained from them by\\r\\nlogical analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe difference between philosophy and mathematics may be illustrated by\\r\\nour present problem, namely, the nature of number. both start from\\r\\ncertain facts about numbers which are evident to inspection. but\\r\\nmathematics uses these facts to deduce more and more complicated\\r\\ntheorems, while philosophy seeks, by analysis, to go behind these facts\\r\\nto others, simpler, more fundamental, and inherently more fitted to form\\r\\nthe premisses of the science of arithmetic. the question, \"what is a\\r\\nnumber?\" is the pre-eminent philosophic question in this subject, but it\\r\\nis one which the mathematician as such need not ask, provided he knows\\r\\nenough of the properties of numbers to enable him to deduce his\\r\\ntheorems. we, since our object is philosophical, must grapple with the\\r\\nphilosopher\\'s question. the answer to the question, \"what is a number?\"\\r\\nwhich we shall reach in this lecture, will be found to give also, by\\r\\nimplication, the answer to the difficulties of infinity which we\\r\\nconsidered in the previous lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question \"what is a number?\" is one which, until quite recent times,\\r\\nwas never considered in the kind of way that is capable of yielding a\\r\\nprecise answer. philosophers were content with some vague dictum such\\r\\nas, \"number is unity in plurality.\" a typical definition of the kind\\r\\nthat contented philosophers is the following from sigwart\\'s _logic_\\r\\n(sec. 66, section 3): \"every number is not merely a _plurality_, but a\\r\\nplurality thought _as held together and closed, and to that extent as a\\r\\nunity_.\" now there is in such definitions a very elementary blunder, of\\r\\nthe same kind that would be committed if we said \"yellow is a flower\"\\r\\nbecause some flowers are yellow. take, for example, the number 3. a\\r\\nsingle collection of three things might conceivably be described as \"a\\r\\nplurality thought as held together and closed, and to that extent as a\\r\\nunity\"; but a collection of three things is not the number 3. the number\\r\\n3 is something which all collections of three things have in common, but\\r\\nis not itself a collection of three things. the definition, therefore,\\r\\napart from any other defects, has failed to reach the necessary degree\\r\\nof abstraction: the number 3 is something more abstract than any\\r\\ncollection of three things.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch vague philosophic definitions, however, remained inoperative\\r\\nbecause of their very vagueness. what most men who thought about numbers\\r\\nreally had in mind was that numbers are the result of _counting_. \"on\\r\\nthe consciousness of the law of counting,\" says sigwart at the beginning\\r\\nof his discussion of number, \"rests the possibility of spontaneously\\r\\nprolonging the series of numbers _ad infinitum_.\" it is this view of\\r\\nnumber as generated by counting which has been the chief psychological\\r\\nobstacle to the understanding of infinite numbers. counting, because it\\r\\nis familiar, is erroneously supposed to be simple, whereas it is in fact\\r\\na highly complex process, which has no meaning unless the numbers\\r\\nreached in counting have some significance independent of the process by\\r\\nwhich they are reached. and infinite numbers cannot be reached at all in\\r\\nthis way. the mistake is of the same kind as if cows were defined as\\r\\nwhat can be bought from a cattle-merchant. to a person who knew several\\r\\ncattle-merchants, but had never seen a cow, this might seem an admirable\\r\\ndefinition. but if in his travels he came across a herd of wild cows, he\\r\\nwould have to declare that they were not cows at all, because no\\r\\ncattle-merchant could sell them. so infinite numbers were declared not\\r\\nto be numbers at all, because they could not be reached by counting.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be worth while to consider for a moment what counting actually\\r\\nis. we count a set of objects when we let our attention pass from one to\\r\\nanother, until we have attended once to each, saying the names of the\\r\\nnumbers in order with each successive act of attention. the last number\\r\\nnamed in this process is the number of the objects, and therefore\\r\\ncounting is a method of finding out what the number of the objects is.\\r\\nbut this operation is really a very complicated one, and those who\\r\\nimagine that it is the logical source of number show themselves\\r\\nremarkably incapable of analysis. in the first place, when we say \"one,\\r\\ntwo, three ...\" as we count, we cannot be said to be discovering the\\r\\nnumber of the objects counted unless we attach some meaning to the words\\r\\none, two, three, ... a child may learn to know these words in order, and\\r\\nto repeat them correctly like the letters of the alphabet, without\\r\\nattaching any meaning to them. such a child may count correctly from the\\r\\npoint of view of a grown-up listener, without having any idea of numbers\\r\\nat all. the operation of counting, in fact, can only be intelligently\\r\\nperformed by a person who already has some idea what the numbers are;\\r\\nand from this it follows that counting does not give the logical basis\\r\\nof number.\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, how do we know that the last number reached in the process of\\r\\ncounting is the number of the objects counted? this is just one of those\\r\\nfacts that are too familiar for their significance to be realised; but\\r\\nthose who wish to be logicians must acquire the habit of dwelling upon\\r\\nsuch facts. there are two propositions involved in this fact: first,\\r\\nthat the number of numbers from 1 up to any given number is that given\\r\\nnumber--for instance, the number of numbers from 1 to 100 is a hundred;\\r\\nsecondly, that if a set of numbers can be used as names of a set of\\r\\nobjects, each number occurring only once, then the number of numbers\\r\\nused as names is the same as the number of objects. the first of these\\r\\npropositions is capable of an easy arithmetical proof so long as finite\\r\\nnumbers are concerned; but with infinite numbers, after the first, it\\r\\nceases to be true. the second proposition remains true, and is in fact,\\r\\nas we shall see, an immediate consequence of the definition of number.\\r\\nbut owing to the falsehood of the first proposition where infinite\\r\\nnumbers are concerned, counting, even if it were practically possible,\\r\\nwould not be a valid method of discovering the number of terms in an\\r\\ninfinite collection, and would in fact give different results according\\r\\nto the manner in which it was carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two respects in which the infinite numbers that are known\\r\\ndiffer from finite numbers: first, infinite numbers have, while finite\\r\\nnumbers have not, a property which i shall call _reflexiveness_;\\r\\nsecondly, finite numbers have, while infinite numbers have not, a\\r\\nproperty which i shall call _inductiveness_. let us consider these two\\r\\nproperties successively.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) _reflexiveness._--a number is said to be _reflexive_ when it is not\\r\\nincreased by adding 1 to it. it follows at once that any finite number\\r\\ncan be added to a reflexive number without increasing it. this property\\r\\nof infinite numbers was always thought, until recently, to be\\r\\nself-contradictory; but through the work of georg cantor it has come to\\r\\nbe recognised that, though at first astonishing, it is no more\\r\\nself-contradictory than the fact that people at the antipodes do not\\r\\ntumble off. in virtue of this property, given any infinite collection of\\r\\nobjects, any finite number of objects can be added or taken away without\\r\\nincreasing or diminishing the number of the collection. even an infinite\\r\\nnumber of objects may, under certain conditions, be added or taken away\\r\\nwithout altering the number. this may be made clearer by the help of\\r\\nsome examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nimagine all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... to be written down in a\\r\\nrow, and immediately beneath them write down the numbers 1, 2, 3,\\r\\n4, ..., so that 1 is under 0, 2 is under 1, and so on. then every number\\r\\nin the top row has a number directly under it in the bottom row, and no\\r\\nnumber occurs twice in either row. it follows that the number of numbers\\r\\nin the two rows must be the same. but all the numbers that occur in the\\r\\nbottom row also occur in the top row, and one more, namely 0; thus the\\r\\nnumber of terms in the top row is obtained by adding one to the number\\r\\nof the bottom row. so long, therefore, as it was supposed that a number\\r\\nmust be increased by adding 1 to it, this state of things constituted a\\r\\ncontradiction, and led to the denial that there are infinite numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  0, 1, 2, 3, ... _n_ ...\\r\\n  1, 2, 3, 4, ... _n_ + 1 ...\\r\\n\\r\\nthe following example is even more surprising. write the natural numbers\\r\\n1, 2, 3, 4, ... in the top row, and the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, ... in\\r\\nthe bottom row, so that under each number in the top row stands its\\r\\ndouble in the bottom row. then, as before, the number of numbers in the\\r\\ntwo rows is the same, yet the second row results from taking away all\\r\\nthe odd numbers--an infinite collection--from the top row. this example\\r\\nis given by leibniz to prove that there can be no infinite numbers. he\\r\\nbelieved in infinite collections, but, since he thought that a number\\r\\nmust always be increased when it is added to and diminished when it is\\r\\nsubtracted from, he maintained that infinite collections do not have\\r\\nnumbers. \"the number of all numbers,\" he says, \"implies a contradiction,\\r\\nwhich i show thus: to any number there is a corresponding number equal\\r\\nto its double. therefore the number of all numbers is not greater than\\r\\nthe number of even numbers, _i.e._ the whole is not greater than its\\r\\npart.\"[49] in dealing with this argument, we ought to substitute \"the\\r\\nnumber of all finite numbers\" for \"the number of all numbers\"; we then\\r\\nobtain exactly the illustration given by our two rows, one containing\\r\\nall the finite numbers, the other only the even finite numbers. it will\\r\\nbe seen that leibniz regards it as self-contradictory to maintain that\\r\\nthe whole is not greater than its part. but the word \"greater\" is one\\r\\nwhich is capable of many meanings; for our purpose, we must substitute\\r\\nthe less ambiguous phrase \"containing a greater number of terms.\" in\\r\\nthis sense, it is not self-contradictory for whole and part to be equal;\\r\\nit is the realisation of this fact which has made the modern theory of\\r\\ninfinity possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [49] _phil. werke_, gerhardt\\'s edition, vol. i. p. 338.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is an interesting discussion of the reflexiveness of infinite\\r\\nwholes in the first of galileo\\'s dialogues on motion. i quote from a\\r\\ntranslation published in 1730.[50] the personages in the dialogue are\\r\\nsalviati, sagredo, and simplicius, and they reason as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_simp._ here already arises a doubt which i think is not to be\\r\\nresolv\\'d; and that is this: since \\'tis plain that one line is given\\r\\ngreater than another, and since both contain infinite points, we must\\r\\nsurely necessarily infer, that we have found in the same species\\r\\nsomething greater than infinite, since the infinity of points of the\\r\\ngreater line exceeds the infinity of points of the lesser. but now, to\\r\\nassign an infinite greater than an infinite, is what i can\\'t possibly\\r\\nconceive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_salv._ these are some of those difficulties which arise from\\r\\ndiscourses which our finite understanding makes about infinites, by\\r\\nascribing to them attributes which we give to things finite and\\r\\nterminate, which i think most improper, because those attributes of\\r\\nmajority, minority, and equality, agree not with infinities, of which we\\r\\ncan\\'t say that one is greater than, less than, or equal to another. for\\r\\nproof whereof i have something come into my head, which (that i may be\\r\\nthe better understood) i will propose by way of interrogatories to\\r\\n_simplicius_, who started this difficulty. to begin then: i suppose you\\r\\nknow which are square numbers, and which not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_simp._ i know very well that a square number is that which arises from\\r\\nthe multiplication of any number into itself; thus 4 and 9 are square\\r\\nnumbers, that arising from 2, and this from 3, multiplied by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_salv._ very well; and you also know, that as the products are call\\'d\\r\\nsquares, the factors are call\\'d roots: and that the other numbers, which\\r\\nproceed not from numbers multiplied into themselves, are not squares.\\r\\nwhence taking in all numbers, both squares and not squares, if i should\\r\\nsay, that the not squares are more than the squares, should i not be in\\r\\nthe right?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_simp._ most certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_salv._ if i go on with you then, and ask you, how many squar\\'d numbers\\r\\nthere are? you may truly answer, that there are as many as are their\\r\\nproper roots, since every square has its own root, and every root its\\r\\nown square, and since no square has more than one root, nor any root\\r\\nmore than one square.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_simp._ very true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_salv._ but now, if i should ask how many roots there are, you can\\'t\\r\\ndeny but there are as many as there are numbers, since there\\'s no number\\r\\nbut what\\'s the root to some square. and this being granted, we may\\r\\nlikewise affirm, that there are as many square numbers, as there are\\r\\nnumbers; for there are as many squares as there are roots, and as many\\r\\nroots as numbers. and yet in the beginning of this, we said, there were\\r\\nmany more numbers than squares, the greater part of numbers being not\\r\\nsquares: and tho\\' the number of squares decreases in a greater\\r\\nproportion, as we go on to bigger numbers, for count to an hundred\\r\\nyou\\'ll find 10 squares, viz. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, which\\r\\nis the same as to say the 10th part are squares; in ten thousand only\\r\\nthe 100th part are squares; in a million only the 1000th: and yet in an\\r\\ninfinite number, if we can but comprehend it, we may say the squares are\\r\\nas many as all the numbers taken together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_sagr._ what must be

galilei,\\r\\n  chief philosopher and mathematician to the grand duke of tuscany. done\\r\\n  into english from the italian, by tho. weston, late master, and now\\r\\n  published by john weston, present master, of the academy at greenwich.\\r\\n  see pp. 46 ff.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe way in which the problem is expounded in the above discussion is\\r\\nworthy of galileo, but the solution suggested is not the right one. it\\r\\nis actually the case that the number of square (finite) numbers is the\\r\\nsame as the number of (finite) numbers. the fact that, so long as we\\r\\nconfine ourselves to numbers less than some given finite number, the\\r\\nproportion of squares tends towards zero as the given finite number\\r\\nincreases, does not contradict the fact that the number of all finite\\r\\nsquares is the same as the number of all finite numbers. this is only an\\r\\ninstance of the fact, now familiar to mathematicians, that the _limit_\\r\\nof a function as the variable _approaches_ a given point may not be the\\r\\nsame as its _value_ when the variable actually _reaches_ the given\\r\\npoint. but although the infinite numbers which galileo discusses are\\r\\nequal, cantor has shown that what simplicius could not conceive is true,\\r\\nnamely, that there are an infinite number of different infinite numbers,\\r\\nand that the conception of _greater_ and _less_ can be perfectly well\\r\\napplied to them. the whole of simplicius\\'s difficulty comes, as is\\r\\nevident, from his belief that, if _greater_ and _less_ can be applied, a\\r\\npart of an infinite collection must have fewer terms than the whole; and\\r\\nwhen this is denied, all contradictions disappear. as regards greater\\r\\nand less lengths of lines, which is the problem from which the above\\r\\ndiscussion starts, that involves a meaning of _greater_ and _less_ which\\r\\nis not arithmetical. the number of points is the same in a long line and\\r\\nin a short one, being in fact the same as the number of points in all\\r\\nspace. the _greater_ and _less_ of metrical geometry involves the new\\r\\nmetrical conception of _congruence_, which cannot be developed out of\\r\\narithmetical considerations alone. but this question has not the\\r\\nfundamental importance which belongs to the arithmetical theory of\\r\\ninfinity.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) _non-inductiveness._--the second property by which infinite numbers\\r\\nare distinguished from finite numbers is the property of\\r\\nnon-inductiveness. this will be best explained by defining the positive\\r\\nproperty of inductiveness which characterises the finite numbers, and\\r\\nwhich is named after the method of proof known as \"mathematical\\r\\ninduction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us first consider what is meant by calling a property \"hereditary\"\\r\\nin a given series. take such a property as being named jones. if a man\\r\\nis named jones, so is his son; we will therefore call the property of\\r\\nbeing called jones hereditary with respect to the relation of father and\\r\\nson. if a man is called jones, all his descendants in the direct male\\r\\nline are called jones; this follows from the fact that the property is\\r\\nhereditary. now, instead of the relation of father and son, consider the\\r\\nrelation of a finite number to its immediate successor, that is, the\\r\\nrelation which holds between 0 and 1, between 1 and 2, between 2 and 3,\\r\\nand so on. if a property of numbers is hereditary with respect to this\\r\\nrelation, then if it belongs to (say) 100, it must belong also to all\\r\\nfinite numbers greater than 100; for, being hereditary, it belongs to\\r\\n101 because it belongs to 100, and it belongs to 102 because it belongs\\r\\nto 101, and so on--where the \"and so on\" will take us, sooner or later,\\r\\nto any finite number greater than 100. thus, for example, the property\\r\\nof being greater than 99 is hereditary in the series of finite numbers;\\r\\nand generally, a property is hereditary in this series when, given any\\r\\nnumber that possesses the property, the next number must always also\\r\\npossess it.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that a hereditary property, though it must belong to all\\r\\nthe finite numbers greater than a given number possessing the property,\\r\\nneed not belong to all the numbers less than this number. for example,\\r\\nthe hereditary property of being greater than 99 belongs to 100 and all\\r\\ngreater numbers, but not to any smaller number. similarly, the\\r\\nhereditary property of being called jones belongs to all the descendants\\r\\n(in the direct male line) of those who have this property, but not to\\r\\nall their ancestors, because we reach at last a first jones, before whom\\r\\nthe ancestors have no surname. it is obvious, however, that any\\r\\nhereditary property possessed by adam must belong to all men; and\\r\\nsimilarly any hereditary property possessed by 0 must belong to all\\r\\nfinite numbers. this is the principle of what is called \"mathematical\\r\\ninduction.\" it frequently happens, when we wish to prove that all finite\\r\\nnumbers have some property, that we have first to prove that 0 has the\\r\\nproperty, and then that the property is hereditary, _i.e._ that, if it\\r\\nbelongs to a given number, then it belongs to the next number. owing to\\r\\nthe fact that such proofs are called \"inductive,\" i shall call the\\r\\nproperties to which they are applicable \"inductive\" properties. thus an\\r\\ninductive property of numbers is one which is hereditary and belongs to\\r\\n0.\\r\\n\\r\\ntaking any one of the natural numbers, say 29, it is easy to see that it\\r\\nmust have all inductive properties. for since such properties belong to\\r\\n0 and are hereditary, they belong to 1; therefore, since they are\\r\\nhereditary, they belong to 2, and so on; by twenty-nine repetitions of\\r\\nsuch arguments we show that they belong to 29. we may _define_ the\\r\\n\"inductive\" numbers as _all those that possess all inductive\\r\\nproperties_; they will be the same as what are called the \"natural\"\\r\\nnumbers, _i.e._ the ordinary finite whole numbers. to all such numbers,\\r\\nproofs by mathematical induction can be validly applied. they are those\\r\\nnumbers, we may loosely say, which can be reached from 0 by successive\\r\\nadditions of 1; in other words, they are all the numbers that can be\\r\\nreached by counting.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut beyond all these numbers, there are the infinite numbers, and\\r\\ninfinite numbers do not have all inductive properties. such numbers,\\r\\ntherefore, may be called non-inductive. all those properties of numbers\\r\\nwhich are proved by an imaginary step-by-step process from one number to\\r\\nthe next are liable to fail when we come to infinite numbers. the first\\r\\nof the infinite numbers has no immediate predecessor, because there is\\r\\nno greatest finite number; thus no succession of steps from one number\\r\\nto the next will ever reach from a finite number to an infinite one, and\\r\\nthe step-by-step method of proof fails. this is another reason for the\\r\\nsupposed self-contradictions of infinite numbers. many of the most\\r\\nfamiliar properties of numbers, which custom had led people to regard as\\r\\nlogically necessary, are in fact only demonstrable by the step-by-step\\r\\nmethod, and fail to be true of infinite numbers. but so soon as we\\r\\nrealise the necessity of proving such properties by mathematical\\r\\ninduction, and the strictly limited scope of this method of proof, the\\r\\nsupposed contradictions are seen to contradict, not logic, but only our\\r\\nprejudices and mental habits.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe property of being increased by the addition of 1--_i.e._ the\\r\\nproperty of non-reflexiveness--may serve to illustrate the limitations\\r\\nof mathematical induction. it is easy to prove that 0 is increased by\\r\\nthe addition of 1, and that, if a given number is increased by the\\r\\naddition of 1, so is the next number, _i.e._ the number obtained by the\\r\\naddition of 1. it follows that each of the natural numbers is increased\\r\\nby the addition of 1. this follows generally from the general argument,\\r\\nand follows for each particular case by a sufficient number of\\r\\napplications of the argument. we first prove that 0 is not equal to 1;\\r\\nthen, since the property of being increased by 1 is hereditary, it\\r\\nfollows that 1 is not equal to 2; hence it follows that 2 is not equal\\r\\nto 3; if we wish to prove that 30,000 is not equal to 30,001, we can do\\r\\nso by repeating this reasoning 30,000 times. but we cannot prove in this\\r\\nway that _all_ numbers are increased by the addition of 1; we can only\\r\\nprove that this holds of the numbers attainable by successive additions\\r\\nof 1 starting from 0. the reflexive numbers, which lie beyond all those\\r\\nattainable in this way, are as a matter of fact not increased by the\\r\\naddition of 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe two properties of reflexiveness and non-inductiveness, which we have\\r\\nconsidered as characteristics of infinite numbers, have not so far been\\r\\nproved to be always found together. it is known that all reflexive\\r\\nnumbers are non-inductive, but it is not known that all non-inductive\\r\\nnumbers are reflexive. fallacious proofs of this proposition have been\\r\\npublished by many writers, including myself, but up to the present no\\r\\nvalid proof has been discovered. the infinite numbers actually known,\\r\\nhowever, are all reflexive as well as non-inductive; thus, in\\r\\nmathematical practice, if not in theory, the two properties are always\\r\\nassociated. for our purposes, therefore, it will be convenient to ignore\\r\\nthe bare possibility that there may be non-inductive non-reflexive\\r\\nnumbers, since all known numbers are either inductive or reflexive.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen infinite numbers are first introduced to people, they are apt to\\r\\nrefuse the name of numbers to them, because their behaviour is so\\r\\ndifferent from that of finite numbers that it seems a wilful misuse of\\r\\nterms to call them numbers at all. in order to meet this feeling, we\\r\\nmust now turn to the logical basis of arithmetic, and consider the\\r\\nlogical definition of numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe logical definition of numbers, though it seems an essential support\\r\\nto the theory of infinite numbers, was in fact discovered independently\\r\\nand by a different man. the theory of infinite numbers--that is to say,\\r\\nthe arithmetical as opposed to the logical part of the theory--was\\r\\ndiscovered by georg cantor, and published by him in 1882-3.[51] the\\r\\ndefinition of number was discovered about the same time by a man whose\\r\\ngreat genius has not received the recognition it deserves--i mean\\r\\ngottlob frege of jena. his first work, _begriffsschrift_, published in\\r\\n1879, contained the very important theory of hereditary properties in a\\r\\nseries to which i alluded in connection with inductiveness. his\\r\\ndefinition of number is contained in his second work, published in 1884,\\r\\nand entitled _die grundlagen der arithmetik, eine logisch-mathematische\\r\\nuntersuchung ueber den begriff der zahl_.[52] it is with this book that\\r\\nthe logical theory of arithmetic begins, and it will repay us to\\r\\nconsider frege\\'s analysis in some detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [51] in his _grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannichfaltigkeitslehre_ and\\r\\n  in articles in _acta mathematica_, vol. ii.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [52] the definition of number contained in this book, and elaborated\\r\\n  in the _grundgesetze der arithmetik_ (vol. i., 1893; vol. ii., 1903),\\r\\n  was rediscovered by me in ignorance of frege\\'s work. i wish to state\\r\\n  as emphatically as possible--what seems still often ignored--that his\\r\\n  discovery antedated mine by eighteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrege begins by noting the increased desire for logical strictness in\\r\\nmathematical demonstrations which distinguishes modern mathematicians\\r\\nfrom their predecessors, and points out that this must lead to a\\r\\ncritical investigation of the definition of number. he proceeds to show\\r\\nthe inadequacy of previous philosophical theories, especially of the\\r\\n\"synthetic _a priori_\" theory of kant and the empirical theory of mill.\\r\\nthis brings him to the question: what kind of object is it that number\\r\\ncan properly be ascribed to? he points out that physical things may be\\r\\nregarded as one or many: for example, if a tree has a thousand leaves,\\r\\nthey may be taken altogether as constituting its foliage, which would\\r\\ncount as one, not as a thousand; and _one_ pair of boots is the same\\r\\nobject as _two_ boots. it follows that physical things are not the\\r\\nsubjects of which number is properly predicated; for when we have\\r\\ndiscovered the proper subjects, the number to be ascribed must be\\r\\nunambiguous. this leads to a discussion of the very prevalent view that\\r\\nnumber is really something psychological and subjective, a view which\\r\\nfrege emphatically rejects. \"number,\" he says, \"is as little an object\\r\\nof psychology or an outcome of psychical processes as the north sea....\\r\\nthe botanist wishes to state something which is just as much a fact when\\r\\nhe gives the number of petals in a flower as when he gives its colour.\\r\\nthe one depends as little as the other upon our caprice. there is\\r\\ntherefore a certain similarity between number and colour; but this does\\r\\nnot consist in the fact that both are sensibly perceptible in external\\r\\nthings, but in the fact that both are objective\" (p. 34).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i distinguish the objective,\" he continues, \"from the palpable, the\\r\\nspatial, the actual. the earth\\'s axis, the centre of mass of the solar\\r\\nsystem, are objective, but i should not call them actual, like the earth\\r\\nitself\" (p. 35). he concludes that number is neither spatial and\\r\\nphysical, nor subjective, but non-sensible and objective. this\\r\\nconclusion is important, since it applies to all the subject-matter of\\r\\nmathematics and logic. most philosophers have thought that the physical\\r\\nand the mental between them exhausted the world of being. some have\\r\\nargued that the objects of mathematics were obviously not subjective,\\r\\nand therefore must be physical and empirical; others have argued that\\r\\nthey were obviously not physical, and therefore must be subjective and\\r\\nmental. both sides were right in what they denied, and wrong in what\\r\\nthey asserted; frege has the merit of accepting both denials, and\\r\\nfinding a third assertion by recognising the world of logic, which is\\r\\nneither mental nor physical.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fact is, as frege points out, that no number, not even 1, is\\r\\napplicable to physical things, but only to general terms or\\r\\ndescriptions, such as \"man,\" \"satellite of the earth,\" \"satellite of\\r\\nvenus.\" the general term \"man\" is applicable to a certain number of\\r\\nobjects: there are in the world so and so many men. the unity which\\r\\nphilosophers rightly feel to be necessary for the assertion of a number\\r\\nis the unity of the general term, and it is the general term which is\\r\\nthe proper subject of number. and this applies equally when there is one\\r\\nobject or none which falls under the general term. \"satellite of the\\r\\nearth\" is a term only applicable to one object, namely, the moon. but\\r\\n\"one\" is not a property of the moon itself, which may equally well be\\r\\nregarded as many molecules: it is a property of the general term\\r\\n\"earth\\'s satellite.\" similarly, 0 is a property of the general term\\r\\n\"satellite of venus,\" because venus has no satellite. here at last we\\r\\nhave an intelligible theory of the number 0. this was impossible if\\r\\nnumbers applied to physical objects, because obviously no physical\\r\\nobject could have the number 0. thus, in seeking our definition of\\r\\nnumber we have arrived so far at the result that numbers are properties\\r\\nof general terms or general descriptions, not of physical things or of\\r\\nmental occurrences.\\r\\n\\r\\ninstead of speaking of a general term, such as \"man,\" as the subject of\\r\\nwhich a number can be asserted, we may, without making any serious\\r\\nchange, take the subject as the class or collection of objects--_i.e._\\r\\n\"mankind\" in the above instance--to which the general term in question\\r\\nis applicable. two general terms, such as \"man\" and \"featherless biped,\"\\r\\nwhich are applicable to the same collection of objects, will obviously\\r\\nhave the same number of instances; thus the number depends upon the\\r\\nclass, not upon the selection of this or that general term to describe\\r\\nit, provided several general terms can be found to describe the same\\r\\nclass. but some general term is always necessary in order to describe a\\r\\nclass. even when the terms are enumerated, as \"this and that and the\\r\\nother,\" the collection is constituted by the general property of being\\r\\neither this, or that, or the other, and only so acquires the unity which\\r\\nenables us to speak of it as _one_ collection. and in the case of an\\r\\ninfinite class, enumeration is impossible, so that description by a\\r\\ngeneral characteristic common and peculiar to the members of the class\\r\\nis the only possible description. here, as we see, the theory of number\\r\\nto which frege was led by purely logical considerations becomes of use\\r\\nin showing how infinite classes can be amenable to number in spite of\\r\\nbeing incapable of enumeration.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrege next asks the question: when do two collections have the same\\r\\nnumber of terms? in ordinary life, we decide this question by counting;\\r\\nbut counting, as we saw, is impossible in the case of infinite\\r\\ncollections, and is not logically fundamental with finite collections.\\r\\nwe want, therefore, a different method of answering our question. an\\r\\nillustration may help to make the method clear. i do not know how many\\r\\nmarried men there are in england, but i do know that the number is the\\r\\nsame as the number of married women. the reason i know this is that the\\r\\nrelation of husband and wife relates one man to one woman and one woman\\r\\nto one man. a relation of this sort is called a one-one relation. the\\r\\nrelation of father to son is called a one-many relation, because a man\\r\\ncan have only one father but may have many sons; conversely, the\\r\\nrelation of son to father is called a many-one relation. but the\\r\\nrelation of husband to wife (in christian countries) is called one-one,\\r\\nbecause a man cannot have more than one wife, or a woman more than one\\r\\nhusband. now, whenever there is a one-one relation between all the terms\\r\\nof one collection and all the terms of another severally, as in the case\\r\\nof english husbands and english wives, the number of terms in the one\\r\\ncollection is the same as the number in the other; but when there is not\\r\\nsuch a relation, the number is different. this is the answer to the\\r\\nquestion: when do two collections have the same number of terms?\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now at last answer the question: what is meant by the number of\\r\\nterms in a given collection? when there is a one-one relation between\\r\\nall the terms of one collection and all the terms of another severally,\\r\\nwe shall say that the two collections are \"similar.\" we have just seen\\r\\nthat two similar collections have the same number of terms. this leads\\r\\nus to define the number of a given collection as the class of all\\r\\ncollections that are similar to it; that is to say, we set up the\\r\\nfollowing formal definition:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the number of terms in a given class\" is defined as meaning \"the class\\r\\nof all classes that are similar to the given class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis definition, as frege (expressing it in slightly different terms)\\r\\nshowed, yields the usual arithmetical properties of numbers. it is\\r\\napplicable equally to finite and infinite numbers, and it does not\\r\\nrequire the admission of some new and mysterious set of metaphysical\\r\\nentities. it shows that it is not physical objects, but classes or the\\r\\ngeneral terms by which they are defined, of which numbers can be\\r\\nasserted; and it applies to 0 and 1 without any of the difficulties\\r\\nwhich other theories find in dealing with these two special cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above definition is sure to produce, at first sight, a feeling of\\r\\noddity, which is liable to cause a certain dissatisfaction. it defines\\r\\nthe number 2, for instance, as the class of all couples, and the number\\r\\n3 as the class of all triads. this does not _seem_ to be what we have\\r\\nhitherto been meaning when we spoke of 2 and 3, though it would be\\r\\ndifficult to say _what_ we had been meaning. the answer to a feeling\\r\\ncannot be a logical argument, but nevertheless the answer in this case\\r\\nis not without importance. in the first place, it will be found that\\r\\nwhen an idea which has grown familiar as an unanalysed whole is first\\r\\nresolved accurately into its component parts--which is what we do when\\r\\nwe define it--there is almost always a feeling of unfamiliarity produced\\r\\nby the analysis, which tends to cause a protest against the definition.\\r\\nin the second place, it may be admitted that the definition, like all\\r\\ndefinitions, is to a certain extent arbitrary. in the case of the small\\r\\nfinite numbers, such as 2 and 3, it would be possible to frame\\r\\ndefinitions more nearly in accordance with our unanalysed feeling of\\r\\nwhat we mean; but the method of such definitions would lack uniformity,\\r\\nand would be found to fail sooner or later--at latest when we reached\\r\\ninfinite numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the third place, the real desideratum about such a definition as that\\r\\nof number is not that it should represent as nearly as possible the\\r\\nideas of those who have not gone through the analysis required in order\\r\\nto reach a definition, but that it should give us objects having the\\r\\nrequisite properties. numbers, in fact, must satisfy the formulae of\\r\\narithmetic; any indubitable set of objects fulfilling this requirement\\r\\nmay be called numbers. so far, the simplest set known to fulfil this\\r\\nrequirement is the set introduced by the above definition. in comparison\\r\\nwith this merit, the question whether the objects to which the\\r\\ndefinition applies are like or unlike the vague ideas of numbers\\r\\nentertained by those who cannot give a definition, is one of very little\\r\\nimportance. all the important requirements are fulfilled by the above\\r\\ndefinition, and the sense of oddity which is at first unavoidable will\\r\\nbe found to wear off very quickly with the growth of familiarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, a certain logical doctrine which may be thought to\\r\\nform an objection to the above definition of numbers as classes of\\r\\nclasses--i mean the doctrine that there are no such objects as classes\\r\\nat all. it might be thought that this doctrine would make havoc of a\\r\\ntheory which reduces numbers to classes, and of the many other theories\\r\\nin which we have made use of classes. this, however, would be a mistake:\\r\\nnone of these theories are any the worse for the doctrine that classes\\r\\nare fictions. what the doctrine is, and why it is not destructive, i\\r\\nwill try briefly to explain.\\r\\n\\r\\non account of certain rather complicated difficulties, culminating in\\r\\ndefinite contradictions, i was led to the view that nothing that can be\\r\\nsaid significantly about things, _i.e._ particulars, can be said\\r\\nsignificantly (_i.e._ either truly or falsely) about classes of things.\\r\\nthat is to say, if, in any sentence in which a thing is mentioned, you\\r\\nsubstitute a class for the thing, you no longer have a sentence that has\\r\\nany meaning: the sentence is no longer either true or false, but a\\r\\nmeaningless collection of words. appearances to the contrary can be\\r\\ndispelled by a moment\\'s reflection. for example, in the sentence, \"adam\\r\\nis fond of apples,\" you may substitute _mankind_, and say, \"mankind is\\r\\nfond of apples.\" but obviously you do not mean that there is one\\r\\nindividual, called \"mankind,\" which munches apples: you mean that the\\r\\nseparate individuals who compose mankind are each severally fond of\\r\\napples.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow, if nothing that can be said significantly about a thing can be said\\r\\nsignificantly about a class of things, it follows that classes of things\\r\\ncannot have the same kind of reality as things have; for if they had, a\\r\\nclass could be substituted for a thing in a proposition predicating the\\r\\nkind of reality which would be common to both. this view is really\\r\\nconsonant to common sense. in the third or fourth century b.c. there\\r\\nlived a chinese philosopher named hui tzu, who maintained that \"a bay\\r\\nhorse and a dun cow are three; because taken separately they are two,\\r\\nand taken together they are one: two and one make three.\"[53] the author\\r\\nfrom whom i quote says that hui tzu \"was particularly fond of the\\r\\nquibbles which so delighted the sophists or unsound reasoners of ancient\\r\\ngreece,\" and this no doubt represents the judgment of common sense upon\\r\\nsuch arguments. yet if collections of things were things, his contention\\r\\nwould be irrefragable. it is only because the bay horse and the dun cow\\r\\ntaken together are not a new thing that we can escape the conclusion\\r\\nthat there are three things wherever there are two.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [53] giles, _the civilisation of china_ (home university library),\\r\\n  p. 147.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen it is admitted that classes are not things, the question arises:\\r\\nwhat do we mean by statements which are nominally about classes? take\\r\\nsuch a statement as, \"the class of people interested in mathematical\\r\\nlogic is not very numerous.\" obviously this reduces itself to, \"not very\\r\\nmany people are interested in mathematical logic.\" for the sake of\\r\\ndefiniteness, let us substitute some particular number, say 3, for \"very\\r\\nmany.\" then our statement is, \"not three people are interested in\\r\\nmathematical logic.\" this may be expressed in the form: \"if _x_ is\\r\\ninterested in mathematical logic, and also _y_ is interested, and also\\r\\n_z_ is interested, then _x_ is identical with _y_, or _x_ is identical\\r\\nwith _z_, or _y_ is identical with _z_.\" here there is no longer any\\r\\nreference at all to a \"class.\" in some such way, all statements\\r\\nnominally about a class can be reduced to statements about what follows\\r\\nfrom the hypothesis of anything\\'s having the defining property of the\\r\\nclass. all that is wanted, therefore, in order to render the _verbal_\\r\\nuse of classes legitimate, is a uniform method of interpreting\\r\\npropositions in which such a use occurs, so as to obtain propositions in\\r\\nwhich there is no longer any such use. the definition of such a method\\r\\nis a technical matter, which dr whitehead and i have dealt with\\r\\nelsewhere, and which we need not enter into on this occasion.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\n  [54] cf. _principia mathematica_, sec. 20, and introduction, chapter iii.\\r\\n\\r\\nif the theory that classes are merely symbolic is accepted, it follows\\r\\nthat numbers are not actual entities, but that propositions in which\\r\\nnumbers verbally occur have not really any constituents corresponding to\\r\\nnumbers, but only a certain logical form which is not a part of\\r\\npropositions having this form. this is in fact the case with all the\\r\\napparent objects of logic and mathematics. such words as _or_, _not_,\\r\\n_if_, _there is_, _identity_, _greater_, _plus_, _nothing_,\\r\\n_everything_, _function_, and so on, are not names of definite objects,\\r\\nlike \"john\" or \"jones,\" but are words which require a context in order\\r\\nto have meaning. all of them are _formal_, that is to say, their\\r\\noccurrence indicates a certain form of proposition, not a certain\\r\\nconstituent. \"logical constants,\" in short, are not entities; the words\\r\\nexpressing them are not names, and cannot significantly be made into\\r\\nlogical subjects except when it is the words themselves, as opposed to\\r\\ntheir meanings, that are being discussed.[55] this fact has a very\\r\\nimportant bearing on all logic and philosophy, since it shows how they\\r\\ndiffer from the special sciences. but the questions raised are so large\\r\\nand so difficult that it is impossible to pursue them further on this\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [55] in the above remarks i am making use of unpublished work by my\\r\\n  friend ludwig wittgenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture viii\\r\\n\\r\\non the notion of cause, with applications to the free-will problem\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe nature of philosophic analysis, as illustrated in our previous\\r\\nlectures, can now be stated in general terms. we start from a body of\\r\\ncommon knowledge, which constitutes our data. on examination, the data\\r\\nare found to be complex, rather vague, and largely interdependent\\r\\nlogically. by analysis we reduce them to propositions which are as\\r\\nnearly as possible simple and precise, and we arrange them in deductive\\r\\nchains, in which a certain number of initial propositions form a logical\\r\\nguarantee for all the rest. these initial propositions are _premisses_\\r\\nfor the body of knowledge in question. premisses are thus quite\\r\\ndifferent from data--they are simpler, more precise, and less infected\\r\\nwith logical redundancy. if the work of analysis has been performed\\r\\ncompletely, they will be wholly free from logical redundancy, wholly\\r\\nprecise, and as simple as is logically compatible with their leading to\\r\\nthe given body of knowledge. the discovery of these premisses belongs to\\r\\nphilosophy; but the work of deducing the body of common knowledge from\\r\\nthem belongs to mathematics, if \"mathematics\" is interpreted in a\\r\\nsomewhat liberal sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut besides the logical analysis of the common knowledge which forms our\\r\\ndata, there is the consideration of its degree of certainty. when we\\r\\nhave arrived at its premisses, we may find that some of them seem open\\r\\nto doubt, and we may find further that this doubt extends to those of\\r\\nour original data which depend upon these doubtful premisses. in our\\r\\nthird lecture, for example, we saw that the part of physics which\\r\\ndepends upon testimony, and thus upon the existence of other minds than\\r\\nour own, does not seem so certain as the part which depends exclusively\\r\\nupon our own sense-data and the laws of logic. similarly, it used to be\\r\\nfelt that the parts of geometry which depend upon the axiom of parallels\\r\\nhave less certainty than the parts which are independent of this\\r\\npremiss. we may say, generally, that what commonly passes as knowledge\\r\\nis not all equally certain, and that, when analysis into premisses has\\r\\nbeen effected, the degree of certainty of any consequence of the\\r\\npremisses will depend upon that of the most doubtful premiss employed in\\r\\nproving this consequence. thus analysis into premisses serves not only a\\r\\nlogical purpose, but also the purpose of facilitating an estimate as to\\r\\nthe degree of certainty to be attached to this or that derivative\\r\\nbelief. in view of the fallibility of all human beliefs, this service\\r\\nseems at least as important as the purely logical services rendered by\\r\\nphilosophical analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the present lecture, i wish to apply the analytic method to the\\r\\nnotion of \"cause,\" and to illustrate the discussion by applying it to\\r\\nthe problem of free will. for this purpose i shall inquire: i., what is\\r\\nmeant by a causal law; ii., what is the evidence that causal laws have\\r\\nheld hitherto; iii., what is the evidence that they will continue to\\r\\nhold in the future; iv., how the causality which is used in science\\r\\ndiffers from that of common sense and traditional philosophy; v., what\\r\\nnew light is thrown on the question of free will by our analysis of the\\r\\nnotion of \"cause.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni. by a \"causal law\" i mean any general proposition in virtue of which\\r\\nit is possible to infer the existence of one thing or event from the\\r\\nexistence of another or of a number of others. if you hear thunder\\r\\nwithout having seen lightning, you infer that there nevertheless was a\\r\\nflash, because of the general proposition, \"all thunder is preceded by\\r\\nlightning.\" when robinson crusoe sees a footprint, he infers a human\\r\\nbeing, and he might justify his inference by the general proposition,\\r\\n\"all marks in the ground shaped like a human foot are subsequent to a\\r\\nhuman being\\'s standing where the marks are.\" when we see the sun set, we\\r\\nexpect that it will rise again the next day. when we hear a man\\r\\nspeaking, we infer that he has certain thoughts. all these inferences\\r\\nare due to causal laws.\\r\\n\\r\\na causal law, we said, allows us to infer the existence of one _thing_\\r\\n(or _event_) from the existence of one or more others. the word \"thing\"\\r\\nhere is to be understood as only applying to particulars, _i.e._ as\\r\\nexcluding such logical objects as numbers or classes or abstract\\r\\nproperties and relations, and including sense-data, with whatever is\\r\\nlogically of the same type as sense-data.[56] in so far as a causal law\\r\\nis directly verifiable, the thing inferred and the thing from which it\\r\\nis inferred must both be data, though they need not both be data at the\\r\\nsame time. in fact, a causal law which is being used to extend our\\r\\nknowledge of existence must be applied to what, at the moment, is not a\\r\\ndatum; it is in the possibility of such application that the practical\\r\\nutility of a causal law consists. the important point, for our present\\r\\npurpose, however, is that what is inferred is a \"thing,\" a \"particular,\"\\r\\nan object having the kind of reality that belongs to objects of sense,\\r\\nnot an abstract object such as virtue or the square root of two.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [56] thus we are not using \"thing\" here in the sense of a class of\\r\\n  correlated \"aspects,\" as we did in lecture iii. each \"aspect\" will\\r\\n  count separately in stating causal laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut we cannot become acquainted with a particular except by its being\\r\\nactually given. hence the particular inferred by a causal law must be\\r\\nonly _described_ with more or less exactness; it cannot be _named_ until\\r\\nthe inference is verified. moreover, since the causal law is _general_,\\r\\nand capable of applying to many cases, the given particular from which\\r\\nwe infer must allow the inference in virtue of some general\\r\\ncharacteristic, not in virtue of its being just the particular that it\\r\\nis. this is obvious in all our previous instances: we infer the\\r\\nunperceived lightning from the thunder, not in virtue of any peculiarity\\r\\nof the thunder, but in virtue of its resemblance to other claps of\\r\\nthunder. thus a causal law must state that the existence of a thing of a\\r\\ncertain sort (or of a number of things of a number of assigned sorts)\\r\\nimplies the existence of another thing having a relation to the first\\r\\nwhich remains invariable so long as the first is of the kind in\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is to be observed that what is constant in a causal law is not the\\r\\nobject or objects given, nor yet the object inferred, both of which may\\r\\nvary within wide limits, but the _relation_ between what is given and\\r\\nwhat is inferred. the principle, \"same cause, same effect,\" which is\\r\\nsometimes said to be the principle of causality, is much narrower in its\\r\\nscope than the principle which really occurs in science; indeed, if\\r\\nstrictly interpreted, it has no scope at all, since the \"same\" cause\\r\\nnever recurs exactly. we shall return to this point at a later stage of\\r\\nthe discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe particular which is inferred may be uniquely determined by the\\r\\ncausal law, or may be only described in such general terms that many\\r\\ndifferent particulars might satisfy the description. this depends upon\\r\\nwhether the constant relation affirmed by the causal law is one which\\r\\nonly one term can have to the data, or one which many terms may have. if\\r\\nmany terms may have the relation in question, science will not be\\r\\nsatisfied until it has found some more stringent law, which will enable\\r\\nus to determine the inferred things uniquely.\\r\\n\\r\\nsince all known things are in time, a causal law must take account of\\r\\ntemporal relations. it will be part of the causal law to state a\\r\\nrelation of succession or coexistence between the thing given and the\\r\\nthing inferred. when we hear thunder and infer that there was lightning,\\r\\nthe law states that the thing inferred is earlier than the thing given.\\r\\nconversely, when we see lightning and wait expectantly for the thunder,\\r\\nthe law states that the thing given is earlier than the thing inferred.\\r\\nwhen we infer a man\\'s thoughts from his words, the law states that the\\r\\ntwo are (at least approximately) simultaneous.\\r\\n\\r\\nif a causal law is to achieve the precision at which science aims, it\\r\\nmust not be content with a vague _earlier_ or _later_, but must state\\r\\nhow much earlier or how much later. that is to say, the time-relation\\r\\nbetween the thing given and the thing inferred ought to be capable of\\r\\nexact statement; and usually the inference to be drawn is different\\r\\naccording to the length and direction of the interval. \"a quarter of an\\r\\nhour ago this man was alive; an hour hence he will be cold.\" such a\\r\\nstatement involves two causal laws, one inferring from a datum something\\r\\nwhich existed a quarter of an hour ago, the other inferring from the\\r\\nsame datum something which will exist an hour hence.\\r\\n\\r\\noften a causal law involves not one datum, but many, which need not be\\r\\nall simultaneous with each other, though their time-relations must be\\r\\ngiven. the general scheme of a causal law will be as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"whenever things occur in certain relations to each other (among which\\r\\ntheir time-relations must be included), then a thing having a fixed\\r\\nrelation to these things will occur at a date fixed relatively to their\\r\\ndates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe things given will not, in practice, be things that only exist for an\\r\\ninstant, for such things, if there are any, can never be data. the\\r\\nthings given will each occupy some finite time. they may be not static\\r\\nthings, but processes, especially motions. we have considered in an\\r\\nearlier lecture the sense in which a motion may be a datum, and need not\\r\\nnow recur to this topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not essential to a causal law that the object inferred should be\\r\\nlater than some or all of the data. it may equally well be earlier or at\\r\\nthe same time. the only thing essential is that the law should be such\\r\\nas to enable us to infer the existence of an object which we can more or\\r\\nless accurately describe in terms of the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. i come now to our second question, namely: what is the nature of the\\r\\nevidence that causal laws have held hitherto, at least in the observed\\r\\nportions of the past? this question must not be confused with the\\r\\nfurther question: does this evidence warrant us in assuming the truth of\\r\\ncausal laws in the future and in unobserved portions of the past? for\\r\\nthe present, i am only asking what are the grounds which lead to a\\r\\nbelief in causal laws, not whether these grounds are adequate to support\\r\\nthe belief in universal causation.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first step is the discovery of approximate unanalysed uniformities\\r\\nof sequence or coexistence. after lightning comes thunder, after a blow\\r\\nreceived comes pain, after approaching a fire comes warmth; again, there\\r\\nare uniformities of coexistence, for example between touch and sight,\\r\\nbetween certain sensations in the throat and the sound of one\\'s own\\r\\nvoice, and so on. every such uniformity of sequence or coexistence,\\r\\nafter it has been experienced a certain number of times, is followed by\\r\\nan expectation that it will be repeated on future occasions, _i.e._ that\\r\\nwhere one of the correlated events is found, the other will be found\\r\\nalso. the connection of experienced past uniformity with expectation as\\r\\nto the future is just one of those uniformities of sequence which we\\r\\nhave observed to be true hitherto. this affords a psychological account\\r\\nof what may be called the animal belief in causation, because it is\\r\\nsomething which can be observed in horses and dogs, and is rather a\\r\\nhabit of acting than a real belief. so far, we have merely repeated\\r\\nhume, who carried the discussion of cause up to this point, but did not,\\r\\napparently, perceive how much remained to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\nis there, in fact, any characteristic, such as might be called causality\\r\\nor uniformity, which is found to hold throughout the observed past? and\\r\\nif so, how is it to be stated?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe particular uniformities which we mentioned before, such as lightning\\r\\nbeing followed by thunder, are not found to be free from exceptions. we\\r\\nsometimes see lightning without hearing thunder; and although, in such a\\r\\ncase, we suppose that thunder might have been heard if we had been\\r\\nnearer to the lightning, that is a supposition based on theory, and\\r\\ntherefore incapable of being invoked to support the theory. what does\\r\\nseem, however, to be shown by scientific experience is this: that where\\r\\nan observed uniformity fails, some wider uniformity can be found,\\r\\nembracing more circumstances, and subsuming both the successes and the\\r\\nfailures of the previous uniformity. unsupported bodies in air fall,\\r\\nunless they are balloons or aeroplanes; but the principles of mechanics\\r\\ngive uniformities which apply to balloons and aeroplanes just as\\r\\naccurately as to bodies that fall. there is much that is hypothetical\\r\\nand more or less artificial in the uniformities affirmed by mechanics,\\r\\nbecause, when they cannot otherwise be made applicable, unobserved\\r\\nbodies are inferred in order to account for observed peculiarities.\\r\\nstill, it is an empirical fact that it is possible to preserve the laws\\r\\nby assuming such bodies, and that they never have to be assumed in\\r\\ncircumstances in which they ought to be observable. thus the empirical\\r\\nverification of mechanical laws may be admitted, although we must also\\r\\nadmit that it is less complete and triumphant than is sometimes\\r\\nsupposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nassuming now, what must be admitted to be doubtful, that the whole of\\r\\nthe past has proceeded according to invariable laws, what can we say as\\r\\nto the nature of these laws? they will not be of the simple type which\\r\\nasserts that the same cause always produces the same effect. we may take\\r\\nthe law of gravitation as a sample of the kind of law that appears to be\\r\\nverified without exception. in order to state this law in a form which\\r\\nobservation can confirm, we will confine it to the solar system. it then\\r\\nstates that the motions of planets and their satellites have at every\\r\\ninstant an acceleration compounded of accelerations towards all the\\r\\nother bodies in the solar system, proportional to the masses of those\\r\\nbodies and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. in\\r\\nvirtue of this law, given the state of the solar system throughout any\\r\\nfinite time, however short, its state at all earlier and later times is\\r\\ndeterminate except in so far as other forces than gravitation or other\\r\\nbodies than those in the solar system have to be taken into\\r\\nconsideration. but other forces, so far as science can discover, appear\\r\\nto be equally regular, and equally capable of being summed up in single\\r\\ncausal laws. if the mechanical account of matter were complete, the\\r\\nwhole physical history of the universe, past and future, could be\\r\\ninferred from a sufficient number of data concerning an assigned finite\\r\\ntime, however short.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the mental world, the evidence for the universality of causal laws is\\r\\nless complete than in the physical world. psychology cannot boast of any\\r\\ntriumph comparable to gravitational astronomy. nevertheless, the\\r\\nevidence is not very greatly less than in the physical world. the crude\\r\\nand approximate causal laws from which science starts are just as easy\\r\\nto discover in the mental sphere as in the physical. in the world of\\r\\nsense, there are to begin with the correlations of sight and touch and\\r\\nso on, and the facts which lead us to connect various kinds of\\r\\nsensations with eyes, ears, nose, tongue, etc. then there are such facts\\r\\nas that our body moves in answer to our volitions. exceptions exist, but\\r\\nare capable of being explained as easily as the exceptions to the rule\\r\\nthat unsupported bodies in air fall. there is, in fact, just such a\\r\\ndegree of evidence for causal laws in psychology as will warrant the\\r\\npsychologist in assuming them as a matter of course, though not such a\\r\\ndegree as will suffice to remove all doubt from the mind of a sceptical\\r\\ninquirer. it should be observed that causal laws in which the given term\\r\\nis mental and the inferred term physical, or _vice versa_, are at least\\r\\nas easy to discover as causal laws in which both terms are mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be noticed that, although we have spoken of causal laws, we have\\r\\nnot hitherto introduced the word \"cause.\" at this stage, it will be well\\r\\nto say a few words on legitimate and illegitimate uses of this word. the\\r\\nword \"cause,\" in the scientific account of the world, belongs only to\\r\\nthe early stages, in which small preliminary, approximate\\r\\ngeneralisations are being ascertained with a view to subsequent larger\\r\\nand more invariable laws. we may say, \"arsenic causes death,\" so long as\\r\\nwe are ignorant of the precise process by which the result is brought\\r\\nabout. but in a sufficiently advanced science, the word \"cause\" will not\\r\\noccur in any statement of invariable laws. there is, however, a somewhat\\r\\nrough and loose use of the word \"cause\" which may be preserved. the\\r\\napproximate uniformities which lead to its pre-scientific employment may\\r\\nturn out to be true in all but very rare and exceptional circumstances,\\r\\nperhaps in all circumstances that actually occur. in such cases, it is\\r\\nconvenient to be able to speak of the antecedent event as the \"cause\"\\r\\nand the subsequent event as the \"effect.\" in this sense, provided it is\\r\\nrealised that the sequence is not necessary and may have exceptions, it\\r\\nis still possible to employ the words \"cause\" and \"effect.\" it is in\\r\\nthis sense, and in this sense only, that we shall intend the words when\\r\\nwe speak of one particular event \"causing\" another particular event, as\\r\\nwe must sometimes do if we are to avoid intolerable circumlocution.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. we come now to our third question, namely: what reason can be given\\r\\nfor believing that causal laws will hold in future, or that they have\\r\\nheld in unobserved portions of the past?\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat we have said so far is that there have been hitherto certain\\r\\nobserved causal laws, and that all the empirical evidence we possess is\\r\\ncompatible with the view that everything, both mental and physical, so\\r\\nfar as our observation has extended, has happened in accordance with\\r\\ncausal laws. the law of universal causation, suggested by these facts,\\r\\nmay be enunciated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"there are such invariable relations between different events at the\\r\\nsame or different times that, given the state of the whole universe\\r\\nthroughout any finite time, however short, every previous and subsequent\\r\\nevent can theoretically be determined as a function of the given events\\r\\nduring that time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhave we any reason to believe this universal law? or, to ask a more\\r\\nmodest question, have we any reason to believe that a particular causal\\r\\nlaw, such as the law of gravitation, will continue to hold in the\\r\\nfuture?\\r\\n\\r\\namong observed causal laws is this, that observation of uniformities is\\r\\nfollowed by expectation of their recurrence. a horse who has been driven\\r\\nalways along a certain road expects to be driven along that road again;\\r\\na dog who is always fed at a certain hour expects food at that hour and\\r\\nnot at any other. such expectations, as hume pointed out, explain only\\r\\ntoo well the common-sense belief in uniformities of sequence, but they\\r\\nafford absolutely no logical ground for beliefs as to the future, not\\r\\neven for the belief that we shall continue to expect the continuation of\\r\\nexperienced uniformities, for that is precisely one of those causal laws\\r\\nfor which a ground has to be sought. if hume\\'s account of causation is\\r\\nthe last word, we have not only no reason to suppose that the sun will\\r\\nrise to-morrow, but no reason to suppose that five minutes hence we\\r\\nshall still expect it to rise to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may, of course, be said that all inferences as to the future are in\\r\\nfact invalid, and i do not see how such a view could be disproved. but,\\r\\nwhile admitting the legitimacy of such a view, we may nevertheless\\r\\ninquire: if inferences as to the future _are_ valid, what principle must\\r\\nbe involved in making them?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe principle involved is the principle of induction, which, if it is\\r\\ntrue, must be an _a priori_ logical law, not capable of being proved or\\r\\ndisproved by experience. it is a difficult question how this principle\\r\\nought to be formulated; but if it is to warrant the inferences which we\\r\\nwish to make by its means, it must lead to the following proposition:\\r\\n\"if, in a great number of instances, a thing of a certain kind is\\r\\nassociated in a certain way with a thing of a certain other kind, it is\\r\\nprobable that a thing of the one kind is always similarly associated\\r\\nwith a thing of the other kind; and as the number of instances\\r\\nincreases, the probability approaches indefinitely near to certainty.\"\\r\\nit may well be questioned whether this proposition is true; but if we\\r\\nadmit it, we can infer that any characteristic of the whole of the\\r\\nobserved past is likely to apply to the future and to the unobserved\\r\\npast. this proposition, therefore, if it is true, will warrant the\\r\\ninference that causal laws probably hold at all times, future as well as\\r\\npast; but without this principle, the observed cases of the truth of\\r\\ncausal laws afford no presumption as to the unobserved cases, and\\r\\ntherefore the existence of a thing not directly observed can never be\\r\\nvalidly inferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is thus the principle of induction, rather than the law of causality,\\r\\nwhich is at the bottom of all inferences as to the existence of things\\r\\nnot immediately given. with the principle of induction, all that is\\r\\nwanted for such inferences can be proved; without it, all such\\r\\ninferences are invalid. this principle has not received the attention\\r\\nwhich its great importance deserves. those who were interested in\\r\\ndeductive logic naturally enough ignored it, while those who emphasised\\r\\nthe scope of induction wished to maintain that all logic is empirical,\\r\\nand therefore could not be expected to realise that induction itself,\\r\\ntheir own darling, required a logical principle which obviously could\\r\\nnot be proved inductively, and must therefore be _a priori_ if it could\\r\\nbe known at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view that the law of causality itself is _a priori_ cannot, i think,\\r\\nbe maintained by anyone who realises what a complicated principle it is.\\r\\nin the form which states that \"every event has a cause\" it looks simple;\\r\\nbut on examination, \"cause\" is merged in \"causal law,\" and the\\r\\ndefinition of a \"causal law\" is found to be far from simple. there must\\r\\nnecessarily be _some a priori_ principle involved in inference from\\r\\nthe existence of one thing to that of another, if such inference is ever\\r\\nvalid; but it would appear from the above analysis that the principle in\\r\\nquestion is induction, not causality. whether inferences from past to\\r\\nfuture are valid depends wholly, if our discussion has been sound, upon\\r\\nthe inductive principle: if it is true, such inferences are valid, and\\r\\nif it is false, they are invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\niv. i come now to the question how the conception of causal laws which\\r\\nwe have arrived at is related to the traditional conception of cause as\\r\\nit occurs in philosophy and common sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nhistorically, the notion of cause has been bound up with that of human\\r\\nvolition. the typical cause would be the fiat of a king. the cause is\\r\\nsupposed to be \"active,\" the effect \"passive.\" from this it is easy to\\r\\npass on to the suggestion that a \"true\" cause must contain some\\r\\nprevision of the effect; hence the effect becomes the \"end\" at which the\\r\\ncause aims, and teleology replaces causation in the explanation of\\r\\nnature. but all such ideas, as applied to physics, are mere\\r\\nanthropomorphic superstitions. it is as a reaction against these errors\\r\\nthat mach and others have urged a purely \"descriptive\" view of physics:\\r\\nphysics, they say, does not aim at telling us \"why\" things happen, but\\r\\nonly \"how\" they happen. and if the question \"why?\" means anything more\\r\\nthan the search for a general law according to which a phenomenon\\r\\noccurs, then it is certainly the case that this question cannot be\\r\\nanswered in physics and ought not to be asked. in this sense, the\\r\\ndescriptive view is indubitably in the right. but in using causal laws\\r\\nto support inferences from the observed to the unobserved, physics\\r\\nceases to be _purely_ descriptive, and it is these laws which give the\\r\\nscientifically useful part of the traditional notion of \"cause.\" there\\r\\nis therefore _something_ to preserve in this notion, though it is a very\\r\\ntiny part of what is commonly assumed in orthodox metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to understand the difference between the kind of cause which\\r\\nscience uses and the kind which we naturally imagine, it is necessary to\\r\\nshut out, by an effort, everything that differentiates between past and\\r\\nfuture. this is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do, because our\\r\\nmental life is so intimately bound up with difference. not only do\\r\\nmemory and hope make a difference in our feelings as regards past and\\r\\nfuture, but almost our whole vocabulary is filled with the idea of\\r\\nactivity, of things done now for the sake of their future effects. all\\r\\ntransitive verbs involve the notion of cause as activity, and would have\\r\\nto be replaced by some cumbrous periphrasis before this notion could be\\r\\neliminated.\\r\\n\\r\\nconsider such a statement as, \"brutus killed caesar.\" on another\\r\\noccasion, brutus and caesar might engage our attention, but for the\\r\\npresent it is the killing that we have to study. we may say that to kill\\r\\na person is to cause his death intentionally. this means that desire for\\r\\na person\\'s death causes a certain act, because it is believed that that\\r\\nact will cause the person\\'s death; or more accurately, the desire and\\r\\nthe belief jointly cause the act. brutus desires that caesar should be\\r\\ndead, and believes that he will be dead if he is stabbed; brutus\\r\\ntherefore stabs him, and the stab causes caesar\\'s death, as brutus\\r\\nexpected it would. every act which realises a purpose involves two\\r\\ncausal steps in this way: c is desired, and it is believed (truly if the\\r\\npurpose is achieved) that b will cause c; the desire and the belief\\r\\ntogether cause b, which in turn causes c. thus we have first a, which is\\r\\na desire for c and a belief that b (an act) will cause c; then we have\\r\\nb, the act caused by a, and believed to be a cause of c; then, if the\\r\\nbelief was correct, we have c, caused by b, and if the belief was\\r\\nincorrect we have disappointment. regarded purely scientifically, this\\r\\nseries a, b, c may equally well be considered in the inverse order, as\\r\\nthey would be at a coroner\\'s inquest. but from the point of view of\\r\\nbrutus, the desire, which comes at the beginning, is what makes the\\r\\nwhole series interesting. we feel that if his desires had been\\r\\ndifferent, the effects which he in fact produced would not have\\r\\noccurred. this is true, and gives him a sense of power and freedom. it\\r\\nis equally true that if the effects had not occurred, his desires would\\r\\nhave been different, since being what they were the effects did occur.\\r\\nthus the desires are determined by their consequences just as much as\\r\\nthe consequences by the desires; but as we cannot (in general) know in\\r\\nadvance the consequences of our desires without knowing our desires,\\r\\nthis form of inference is uninteresting as applied to our own acts,\\r\\nthough quite vital as applied to those of others.\\r\\n\\r\\na cause, considered scientifically, has none of that analogy with\\r\\nvolition which makes us imagine that the effect is _compelled_ by it. a\\r\\ncause is an event or group of events, of some known general character,\\r\\nand having a known relation to some other event, called the effect; the\\r\\nrelation being of such a kind that only one event, or at any rate only\\r\\none well-defined sort of event, can have the relation to a given cause.\\r\\nit is customary only to give the name \"effect\" to an event which is\\r\\nlater than the cause, but there is no kind of reason for this\\r\\nrestriction. we shall do better to allow the effect to be before the\\r\\ncause or simultaneous with it, because nothing of any scientific\\r\\nimportance depends upon its being after the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nif the inference from cause to effect is to be indubitable, it seems\\r\\nthat the cause can hardly stop short of the whole universe. so long as\\r\\nanything is left out, something may be left out which alters the\\r\\nexpected result. but for practical and scientific purposes, phenomena\\r\\ncan be collected into groups which are causally self-contained, or\\r\\nnearly so. in the common notion of causation, the cause is a single\\r\\nevent--we say the lightning causes the thunder, and so on. but it is\\r\\ndifficult to know what we mean by a single event; and it generally\\r\\nappears that, in order to have anything approaching certainty concerning\\r\\nthe effect, it is necessary to include many more circumstances in the\\r\\ncause than unscientific common sense would suppose. but often a probable\\r\\ncausal connection, where the cause is fairly simple, is of more\\r\\npractical importance than a more indubitable connection in which the\\r\\ncause is so complex as to be hard to ascertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nto sum up: the strict, certain, universal law of causation which\\r\\nphilosophers advocate is an ideal, possibly true, but not _known_ to be\\r\\ntrue in virtue of any available evidence. what is actually known, as a\\r\\nmatter of empirical science, is that certain constant relations are\\r\\nobserved to hold between the members of a group of events at certain\\r\\ntimes, and that when such relations fail, as they sometimes do, it is\\r\\nusually possible to discover a new, more constant relation by enlarging\\r\\nthe group. any such constant relation between events of specified kinds\\r\\nwith given intervals of time between them is a \"causal law.\" but all\\r\\ncausal laws are liable to exceptions, if the cause is less than the\\r\\nwhole state of the universe; we believe, on the basis of a good deal of\\r\\nexperience, that such exceptions can be dealt with by enlarging the\\r\\ngroup we call the cause, but this belief, wherever it is still\\r\\nunverified, ought not to be regarded as certain, but only as suggesting\\r\\na direction for further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\na very common causal group consists of volitions and the consequent\\r\\nbodily acts, though exceptions arise (for example) through sudden\\r\\nparalysis. another very frequent connection (though here the exceptions\\r\\nare much more numerous) is between a bodily act and the realisation of\\r\\nthe purpose which led to the act. these connections are patent, whereas\\r\\nthe causes of desires are more obscure. thus it is natural to begin\\r\\ncausal series with desires, to suppose that all causes are analogous to\\r\\ndesires, and that desires themselves arise spontaneously. such a view,\\r\\nhowever, is not one which any serious psychologist would maintain. but\\r\\nthis brings us to the question of the application of our analysis of\\r\\ncause to the problem of free will.\\r\\n\\r\\nv. the problem of free will is so intimately bound up with the analysis\\r\\nof causation that, old as it is, we need not despair of obtaining new\\r\\nlight on it by the help of new views on the notion of cause. the\\r\\nfree-will problem has, at one time or another, stirred men\\'s passions\\r\\nprofoundly, and the fear that the will might not be free has been to\\r\\nsome men a source of great unhappiness. i believe that, under the\\r\\ninfluence of a cool analysis, the doubtful questions involved will be\\r\\nfound to have no such emotional importance as is sometimes thought,\\r\\nsince the disagreeable consequences supposed to flow from a denial of\\r\\nfree will do not flow from this denial in any form in which there is\\r\\nreason to make it. it is not, however, on this account chiefly that i\\r\\nwish to discuss this problem, but rather because it affords a good\\r\\nexample of the clarifying effect of analysis and of the interminable\\r\\ncontroversies which may result from its neglect.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us first try to discover what it is we really desire when we desire\\r\\nfree will. some of our reasons for desiring free will are profound, some\\r\\ntrivial. to begin with the former: we do not wish to feel ourselves in\\r\\nthe hands of fate, so that, however much we may desire to will one\\r\\nthing, we may nevertheless be compelled by an outside force to will\\r\\nanother. we do not wish to think that, however much we may desire to act\\r\\nwell, heredity and surroundings may force us into acting ill. we wish to\\r\\nfeel that, in cases of doubt, our choice is momentous and lies within\\r\\nour power. besides these desires, which are worthy of all respect, we\\r\\nhave, however, others not so respectable, which equally make us desire\\r\\nfree will. we do not like to think that other people, if they knew\\r\\nenough, could predict our actions, though we know that we can often\\r\\npredict those of other people, especially if they are elderly. much as\\r\\nwe esteem the old gentleman who is our neighbour in the country, we know\\r\\nthat when grouse are mentioned he will tell the story of the grouse in\\r\\nthe gun-room. but we ourselves are not so mechanical: we never tell an\\r\\nanecdote to the same person twice, or even once unless he is sure to\\r\\nenjoy it; although we once met (say) bismarck, we are quite capable of\\r\\nhearing him mentioned without relating the occasion when we met him. in\\r\\nthis sense, everybody thinks that he himself has free will, though he\\r\\nknows that no one else has. the desire for this kind of free will seems\\r\\nto be no better than a form of vanity. i do not believe that this desire\\r\\ncan be gratified with any certainty; but the other, more respectable\\r\\ndesires are, i believe, not inconsistent with any tenable form of\\r\\ndeterminism.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have thus two questions to consider: (1) are human actions\\r\\ntheoretically predictable from a sufficient number of antecedents? (2)\\r\\nare human actions subject to an external compulsion? the two questions,\\r\\nas i shall try to show, are entirely distinct, and we may answer the\\r\\nfirst in the affirmative without therefore being forced to give an\\r\\naffirmative answer to the second.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) _are human actions theoretically predictable from a sufficient\\r\\nnumber of antecedents?_ let us first endeavour to give precision to this\\r\\nquestion. we may state the question thus: is there some constant\\r\\nrelation between an act and a certain number of earlier events, such\\r\\nthat, when the earlier events are given, only one act, or at most only\\r\\nacts with some well-marked character, can have this relation to the\\r\\nearlier events? if this is the case, then, as soon as the earlier events\\r\\nare known, it is theoretically possible to predict either the precise\\r\\nact, or at least the character necessary to its fulfilling the constant\\r\\nrelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nto this question, a negative answer has been given by bergson, in a form\\r\\nwhich calls in question the general applicability of the law of\\r\\ncausation. he maintains that every event, and more particularly every\\r\\nmental event, embodies so much of the past that it could not possibly\\r\\nhave occurred at any earlier time, and is therefore necessarily quite\\r\\ndifferent from all previous and subsequent events. if, for example, i\\r\\nread a certain poem many times, my experience on each occasion is\\r\\nmodified by the previous readings, and my emotions are never repeated\\r\\nexactly. the principle of causation, according to him, asserts that the\\r\\nsame cause, if repeated, will produce the same effect. but owing to\\r\\nmemory, he contends, this principle does not apply to mental events.\\r\\nwhat is apparently the same cause, if repeated, is modified by the mere\\r\\nfact of repetition, and cannot produce the same effect. he infers that\\r\\nevery mental event is a genuine novelty, not predictable from the past,\\r\\nbecause the past contains nothing exactly like it by which we could\\r\\nimagine it. and on this ground he regards the freedom of the will as\\r\\nunassailable.\\r\\n\\r\\nbergson\\'s contention has undoubtedly a great deal of truth, and i have\\r\\nno wish to deny its importance. but i do not think its consequences are\\r\\nquite what he believes them to be. it is not necessary for the\\r\\ndeterminist to maintain that he can foresee the whole particularity of\\r\\nthe act which will be performed. if he could foresee that a was going to\\r\\nmurder b, his foresight would not be invalidated by the fact that he\\r\\ncould not know all the infinite complexity of a\\'s state of mind in\\r\\ncommitting the murder, nor whether the murder was to be performed with a\\r\\nknife or with a revolver. if the _kind_ of act which will be performed\\r\\ncan be foreseen within narrow limits, it is of little practical interest\\r\\nthat there are fine shades which cannot be foreseen. no doubt every time\\r\\nthe story of the grouse in the gun-room is told, there will be slight\\r\\ndifferences due to increasing habitualness, but they do not invalidate\\r\\nthe prediction that the story will be told. and there is nothing in\\r\\nbergson\\'s argument to show that we can never predict what _kind_ of act\\r\\nwill be performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, his statement of the law of causation is inadequate. the law does\\r\\nnot state merely that, if the _same_ cause is repeated, the _same_\\r\\neffect will result. it states rather that there is a constant relation\\r\\nbetween causes of certain kinds and effects of certain kinds. for\\r\\nexample, if a body falls freely, there is a constant relation between\\r\\nthe height through which it falls and the time it takes in falling. it\\r\\nis not necessary to have a body fall through the _same_ height which has\\r\\nbeen previously observed, in order to be able to foretell the length of\\r\\ntime occupied in falling. if this were necessary, no prediction would be\\r\\npossible, since it would be impossible to make the height exactly the\\r\\nsame on two occasions. similarly, the attraction which the sun will\\r\\nexert on the earth is not only known at distances for which it has been\\r\\nobserved, but at all distances, because it is known to vary as the\\r\\ninverse square of the distance. in fact, what is found to be repeated is\\r\\nalways the _relation_ of cause and effect, not the cause itself; all\\r\\nthat is necessary as regards the cause is that it should be of the same\\r\\n_kind_ (in the relevant respect) as earlier causes whose effects have\\r\\nbeen observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother respect in which bergson\\'s statement of causation is inadequate\\r\\nis in its assumption that the cause must be _one_ event, whereas it may\\r\\nbe two or more events, or even some continuous process. the substantive\\r\\nquestion at issue is whether mental events are determined by the past.\\r\\nnow in such a case as the repeated reading of a poem, it is obvious that\\r\\nour feelings in reading the poem are most emphatically dependent upon\\r\\nthe past, but not upon one single event in the past. all our previous\\r\\nreadings of the poem must be included in the cause. but we easily\\r\\nperceive a certain law according to which the effect varies as the\\r\\nprevious readings increase in number, and in fact bergson himself\\r\\ntacitly assumes such a law. we decide at last not to read the poem\\r\\nagain, because we know that this time the effect would be boredom. we\\r\\nmay not know all the niceties and shades of the boredom we should feel,\\r\\nbut we know enough to guide our decision, and the prophecy of boredom is\\r\\nnone the less true for being more or less general. thus the kinds of\\r\\ncases upon which bergson relies are insufficient to show the\\r\\nimpossibility of prediction in the only sense in which prediction has\\r\\npractical or emotional interest. we may therefore leave the\\r\\nconsideration of his arguments and address ourselves to the problem\\r\\ndirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe law of causation, according to which later events can theoretically\\r\\nbe predicted by means of earlier events, has often been held to be _a\\r\\npriori_, a necessity of thought, a category without which science would\\r\\nbe impossible. these claims seem to me excessive. in certain directions\\r\\nthe law has been verified empirically, and in other directions there is\\r\\nno positive evidence against it. but science can use it where it has\\r\\nbeen found to be true, without being forced into any assumption as to\\r\\nits truth in other fields. we cannot, therefore, feel any _a priori_\\r\\ncertainty that causation must apply to human volitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question how far human volitions are subject to causal laws is a\\r\\npurely empirical one. empirically it seems plain that the great majority\\r\\nof our volitions have causes, but it cannot, on this account, be held\\r\\nnecessarily certain that all have causes. there are, however, precisely\\r\\nthe same kinds of reasons for regarding it as probable that they all\\r\\nhave causes as there are in the case of physical events.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may suppose--though this is doubtful--that there are laws of\\r\\ncorrelation of the mental and the physical, in virtue of which, given\\r\\nthe state of all the matter in the world, and therefore of all the\\r\\nbrains and living organisms, the state of all the minds in the world\\r\\ncould be inferred, while conversely the state of all the matter in the\\r\\nworld could be inferred if the state of all the minds were given. it is\\r\\nobvious that there is _some_ degree of correlation between brain and\\r\\nmind, and it is impossible to say how complete it may be. this, however,\\r\\nis not the point which i wish to elicit. what i wish to urge is that,\\r\\neven if we admit the most extreme claims of determinism and of\\r\\ncorrelation of mind and brain, still the consequences inimical to what\\r\\nis worth preserving in free will do not follow. the belief that they\\r\\nfollow results, i think, entirely from the assimilation of causes to\\r\\nvolitions, and from the notion that causes _compel_ their effects in\\r\\nsome sense analogous to that in which a human authority can compel a man\\r\\nto do what he would rather not do. this assimilation, as soon as the\\r\\ntrue nature of scientific causal laws is realised, is seen to be a sheer\\r\\nmistake. but this brings us to the second of the two questions which we\\r\\nraised in regard to free will, namely, whether, assuming determinism,\\r\\nour actions can be in any proper sense regarded as compelled by outside\\r\\nforces.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) _are human actions subject to an external compulsion?_ we have, in\\r\\ndeliberation, a subjective sense of freedom, which is sometimes alleged\\r\\nagainst the view that volitions have causes. this sense of freedom,\\r\\nhowever, is only a sense that we can choose which we please of a number\\r\\nof alternatives: it does not show us that there is no causal connection\\r\\nbetween what we please to choose and our previous history. the supposed\\r\\ninconsistency of these two springs from the habit of conceiving causes\\r\\nas analogous to volitions--a habit which often survives unconsciously in\\r\\nthose who intend to conceive causes in a more scientific manner. if a\\r\\ncause is analogous to a volition, outside causes will be analogous to an\\r\\nalien will, and acts predictable from outside causes will be subject to\\r\\ncompulsion. but this view of cause is one to which science lends no\\r\\ncountenance. causes, we have seen, do not _compel_ their effects, any\\r\\nmore than effects _compel_ their causes. there is a mutual relation, so\\r\\nthat either can be inferred from the other. when the geologist infers\\r\\nthe past state of the earth from its present state, we should not say\\r\\nthat the present state _compels_ the past state to have been what it\\r\\nwas; yet it renders it necessary as a consequence of the data, in the\\r\\nonly sense in which effects are rendered necessary by their causes. the\\r\\ndifference which we _feel_, in this respect, between causes and effects\\r\\nis a mere confusion due to the fact that we remember past events but do\\r\\nnot happen to have memory of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apparent indeterminateness of the future, upon which some advocates\\r\\nof free will rely, is merely a result of our ignorance. it is plain that\\r\\nno desirable kind of free will can be dependent simply upon our\\r\\nignorance; for if that were the case, animals would be more free than\\r\\nmen, and savages than civilised people. free will in any valuable sense\\r\\nmust be compatible with the fullest knowledge. now, quite apart from any\\r\\nassumption as to causality, it is obvious that complete knowledge would\\r\\nembrace the future as well as the past. our knowledge of the past is not\\r\\nwholly based upon causal inferences, but is partly derived from memory.\\r\\nit is a mere accident that we have no memory of the future. we might--as\\r\\nin the pretended visions of seers--see future events immediately, in the\\r\\nway in which we see past events. they certainly will be what they will\\r\\nbe, and are in this sense just as determined as the past. if we saw\\r\\nfuture events in the same immediate way in which we see past events,\\r\\nwhat kind of free will would still be possible? such a kind would be\\r\\nwholly independent of determinism: it could not be contrary to even the\\r\\nmost entirely universal reign of causality. and such a kind must contain\\r\\nwhatever is worth having in free will, since it is impossible to believe\\r\\nthat mere ignorance can be the essential condition of any good thing.\\r\\nlet us therefore imagine a set of beings who know the whole future with\\r\\nabsolute certainty, and let us ask ourselves whether they could have\\r\\nanything that we should call free will.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch beings as we are imagining would not have to wait for the event in\\r\\norder to know what decision they were going to adopt on some future\\r\\noccasion. they would know now what their volitions were going to be. but\\r\\nwould they have any reason to regret this knowledge? surely not, unless\\r\\nthe foreseen volitions were in themselves regrettable. and it is less\\r\\nlikely that the foreseen volitions would be regrettable if the steps\\r\\nwhich would lead to them were also foreseen. it is difficult not to\\r\\nsuppose that what is foreseen is fated, and must happen however much it\\r\\nmay be dreaded. but human actions are the outcome of desire, and no\\r\\nforeseeing can be true unless it takes account of desire. a foreseen\\r\\nvolition will have to be one which does not become odious through being\\r\\nforeseen. the beings we are imagining would easily come to know the\\r\\ncausal connections of volitions, and therefore their volitions would be\\r\\nbetter calculated to satisfy their desires than ours are. since\\r\\nvolitions are the outcome of desires, a prevision of volitions contrary\\r\\nto desires could not be a true one. it must be remembered that the\\r\\nsupposed prevision would not create the future any more than memory\\r\\ncreates the past. we do not think we were necessarily not free in the\\r\\npast, merely because we can now remember our past volitions. similarly,\\r\\nwe might be free in the future, even if we could now see what our future\\r\\nvolitions were going to be. freedom, in short, in any valuable sense,\\r\\ndemands only that our volitions shall be, as they are, the result of our\\r\\nown desires, not of an outside force compelling us to will what we would\\r\\nrather not will. everything else is confusion of thought, due to the\\r\\nfeeling that knowledge _compels_ the happening of what it knows when\\r\\nthis is future, though it is at once obvious that knowledge has no such\\r\\npower in regard to the past. free will, therefore, is true in the only\\r\\nform which is important; and the desire for other forms is a mere effect\\r\\nof insufficient analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n                   *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat has been said on philosophical method in the foregoing lectures has\\r\\nbeen rather by means of illustrations in particular cases than by means\\r\\nof general precepts. nothing of any value can be said on method except\\r\\nthrough examples; but now, at the end of our course, we may collect\\r\\ncertain general maxims which may possibly be a help in acquiring a\\r\\nphilosophical habit of mind and a guide in looking for solutions of\\r\\nphilosophic problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy does not become scientific by making use of other sciences,\\r\\nin the kind of way in which (_e.g._) herbert spencer does. philosophy\\r\\naims at what is _general_, and the special sciences, however they may\\r\\n_suggest_ large generalisations, cannot make them certain. and a hasty\\r\\ngeneralisation, such as spencer\\'s generalisation of evolution, is none\\r\\nthe less hasty because what is generalised is the latest scientific\\r\\ntheory. philosophy is a study apart from the other sciences: its results\\r\\ncannot be established by the other sciences, and conversely must not be\\r\\nsuch as some other science might conceivably contradict. prophecies as\\r\\nto the future of the universe, for example, are not the business of\\r\\nphilosophy; whether the universe is progressive, retrograde, or\\r\\nstationary, it is not for the philosopher to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to become a scientific philosopher, a certain peculiar mental\\r\\ndiscipline is required. there must be present, first of all, the desire\\r\\nto know philosophical truth, and this desire must be sufficiently strong\\r\\nto survive through years when there seems no hope of its finding any\\r\\nsatisfaction. the desire to know philosophical truth is very rare--in\\r\\nits purity, it is not often found even among philosophers. it is\\r\\nobscured sometimes--particularly after long periods of fruitless\\r\\nsearch--by the desire to _think_ we know. some plausible opinion\\r\\npresents itself, and by turning our attention away from the objections\\r\\nto it, or merely by not making great efforts to find objections to it,\\r\\nwe may obtain the comfort of believing it, although, if we had resisted\\r\\nthe wish for comfort, we should have come to see that the opinion was\\r\\nfalse. again the desire for unadulterated truth is often obscured, in\\r\\nprofessional philosophers, by love of system: the one little fact which\\r\\nwill not come inside the philosopher\\'s edifice has to be pushed and\\r\\ntortured until it seems to consent. yet the one little fact is more\\r\\nlikely to be important for the future than the system with which it is\\r\\ninconsistent. pythagoras invented a system which fitted admirably with\\r\\nall the facts he knew, except the incommensurability of the diagonal of\\r\\na square and the side; this one little fact stood out, and remained a\\r\\nfact even after hippasos of metapontion was drowned for revealing it. to\\r\\nus, the discovery of this fact is the chief claim of pythagoras to\\r\\nimmortality, while his system has become a matter of merely historical\\r\\ncuriosity.[57] love of system, therefore, and the system-maker\\'s vanity\\r\\nwhich becomes associated with it, are among the snares that the student\\r\\nof philosophy must guard against.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [57] the above remarks, for purposes of illustration, adopt one of\\r\\n  several possible opinions on each of several disputed points.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe desire to establish this or that result, or generally to discover\\r\\nevidence for agreeable results, of whatever kind, has of course been the\\r\\nchief obstacle to honest philosophising. so strangely perverted do men\\r\\nbecome by unrecognised passions, that a determination in advance to\\r\\narrive at this or that conclusion is generally regarded as a mark of\\r\\nvirtue, and those whose studies lead to an opposite conclusion are\\r\\nthought to be wicked. no doubt it is commoner to wish to arrive at an\\r\\nagreeable result than to wish to arrive at a true result. but only those\\r\\nin whom the desire to arrive at a _true_ result is paramount can hope to\\r\\nserve any good purpose by the study of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut even when the desire to know exists in the requisite strength, the\\r\\nmental vision by which abstract truth is recognised is hard to\\r\\ndistinguish from vivid imaginability and consonance with mental habits.\\r\\nit is necessary to practise methodological doubt, like descartes, in\\r\\norder to loosen the hold of mental habits; and it is necessary to\\r\\ncultivate logical imagination, in order to have a number of hypotheses\\r\\nat command, and not to be the slave of the one which common sense has\\r\\nrendered easy to imagine. these two processes, of doubting the familiar\\r\\nand imagining the unfamiliar, are correlative, and form the chief part\\r\\nof the mental training required for a philosopher.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe naive beliefs which we find in ourselves when we first begin the\\r\\nprocess of philosophic reflection may turn out, in the end, to be almost\\r\\nall capable of a true interpretation; but they ought all, before being\\r\\nadmitted into philosophy, to undergo the ordeal of sceptical criticism.\\r\\nuntil they have gone through this ordeal, they are mere blind habits,\\r\\nways of behaving rather than intellectual convictions. and although it\\r\\nmay be that a majority will pass the test, we may be pretty sure that\\r\\nsome will not, and that a serious readjustment of our outlook ought to\\r\\nresult. in order to break the dominion of habit, we must do our best to\\r\\ndoubt the senses, reason, morals, everything in short. in some\\r\\ndirections, doubt will be found possible; in others, it will be checked\\r\\nby that direct vision of abstract truth upon which the possibility of\\r\\nphilosophical knowledge depends.\\r\\n\\r\\nat the same time, and as an essential aid to the direct perception of\\r\\nthe truth, it is necessary to acquire fertility in imagining abstract\\r\\nhypotheses. this is, i think, what has most of all been lacking hitherto\\r\\nin philosophy. so meagre was the logical apparatus that all the\\r\\nhypotheses philosophers could imagine were found to be inconsistent with\\r\\nthe facts. too often this state of things led to the adoption of heroic\\r\\nmeasures, such as a wholesale denial of the facts, when an imagination\\r\\nbetter stocked with logical tools would have found a key to unlock the\\r\\nmystery. it is in this way that the study of logic becomes the central\\r\\nstudy in philosophy: it gives the method of research in philosophy, just\\r\\nas mathematics gives the method in physics. and as physics, which, from\\r\\nplato to the renaissance, was as unprogressive, dim, and superstitious\\r\\nas philosophy, became a science through galileo\\'s fresh observation of\\r\\nfacts and subsequent mathematical manipulation, so philosophy, in our\\r\\nown day, is becoming scientific through the simultaneous acquisition of\\r\\nnew facts and logical methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite, however, of the new possibility of progress in philosophy, the\\r\\nfirst effect, as in the case of physics, is to diminish very greatly the\\r\\nextent of what is thought to be known. before galileo, people believed\\r\\nthemselves possessed of immense knowledge on all the most interesting\\r\\nquestions in physics. he established certain facts as to the way in\\r\\nwhich bodies fall, not very interesting on their own account, but of\\r\\nquite immeasurable interest as examples of real knowledge and of a new\\r\\nmethod whose future fruitfulness he himself divined. but his few facts\\r\\nsufficed to destroy the whole vast system of supposed knowledge handed\\r\\ndown from aristotle, as even the palest morning sun suffices to\\r\\nextinguish the stars. so in philosophy: though some have believed one\\r\\nsystem, and others another, almost all have been of opinion that a great\\r\\ndeal was known; but all this supposed knowledge in the traditional\\r\\nsystems must be swept away, and a new beginning must be made, which we\\r\\nshall esteem fortunate indeed if it can attain results comparable to\\r\\ngalileo\\'s law of falling bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nby the practice of methodological doubt, if it is genuine and prolonged,\\r\\na certain humility as to our knowledge is induced: we become glad to\\r\\nknow _anything_ in philosophy, however seemingly trivial. philosophy has\\r\\nsuffered from the lack of this kind of modesty. it has made the mistake\\r\\nof attacking the interesting problems at once, instead of proceeding\\r\\npatiently and slowly, accumulating whatever solid knowledge was\\r\\nobtainable, and trusting the great problems to the future. men of\\r\\nscience are not ashamed of what is intrinsically trivial, if its\\r\\nconsequences are likely to be important; the _immediate_ outcome of an\\r\\nexperiment is hardly ever interesting on its own account. so in\\r\\nphilosophy, it is often desirable to expend time and care on matters\\r\\nwhich, judged alone, might seem frivolous, for it is often only through\\r\\nthe consideration of such matters that the greater problems can be\\r\\napproached.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen our problem has been selected, and the necessary mental discipline\\r\\nhas been acquired, the method to be pursued is fairly uniform. the big\\r\\nproblems which provoke philosophical inquiry are found, on examination,\\r\\nto be complex, and to depend upon a number of component problems,\\r\\nusually more abstract than those of which they are the components. it\\r\\nwill generally be found that all our initial data, all the facts that we\\r\\nseem to know to begin with, suffer from vagueness, confusion, and\\r\\ncomplexity. current philosophical ideas share these defects; it is\\r\\ntherefore necessary to create an apparatus of precise conceptions as\\r\\ngeneral and as free from complexity as possible, before the data can be\\r\\nanalysed into the kind of premisses which philosophy aims at\\r\\ndiscovering. in this process of analysis, the source of difficulty is\\r\\ntracked further and further back, growing at each stage more abstract,\\r\\nmore refined, more difficult to apprehend. usually it will be found that\\r\\na number of these extraordinarily abstract questions underlie any one of\\r\\nthe big obvious problems. when everything has been done that can be done\\r\\nby method, a stage is reached where only direct philosophic vision can\\r\\ncarry matters further. here only genius will avail. what is wanted, as a\\r\\nrule, is some new effort of logical imagination, some glimpse of a\\r\\npossibility never conceived before, and then the direct perception that\\r\\nthis possibility is realised in the case in question. failure to think\\r\\nof the right possibility leaves insoluble difficulties, balanced\\r\\narguments pro and con, utter bewilderment and despair. but the right\\r\\npossibility, as a rule, when once conceived, justifies itself swiftly by\\r\\nits astonishing power of absorbing apparently conflicting facts. from\\r\\nthis point onward, the work of the philosopher is synthetic and\\r\\ncomparatively easy; it is in the very last stage of the analysis that\\r\\nthe real difficulty consists.\\r\\n\\r\\nof the prospect of progress in philosophy, it would be rash to speak\\r\\nwith confidence. many of the traditional problems of philosophy, perhaps\\r\\nmost of those which have interested a wider circle than that of\\r\\ntechnical students, do not appear to be soluble by scientific methods.\\r\\njust as astronomy lost much of its human interest when it ceased to be\\r\\nastrology, so philosophy must lose in attractiveness as it grows less\\r\\nprodigal of promises. but to the large and still growing body of men\\r\\nengaged in the pursuit of science--men who hitherto, not without\\r\\njustification, have turned aside from philosophy with a certain\\r\\ncontempt--the new method, successful already in such time-honoured\\r\\nproblems as number, infinity, continuity, space and time, should make an\\r\\nappeal which the older methods have wholly failed to make. physics, with\\r\\nits principle of relativity and its revolutionary investigations into\\r\\nthe nature of matter, is feeling the need for that kind of novelty in\\r\\nfundamental hypotheses which scientific philosophy aims at facilitating.\\r\\nthe one and only condition, i believe, which is necessary in order to\\r\\nsecure for philosophy in the near future an achievement surpassing all\\r\\nthat has hitherto been accomplished by philosophers, is the creation of\\r\\na school of men with scientific training and philosophical interests,\\r\\nunhampered by the traditions of the past, and not misled by the literary\\r\\nmethods of those who copy the ancients in all except their merits.the analysis of mind\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture i. recent criticisms of \"consciousness\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are certain occurrences which we are in the habit of calling\\r\\n\"mental.\" among these we may take as typical believing and desiring.\\r\\nthe exact definition of the word \"mental\" will, i hope, emerge as\\r\\nthe lectures proceed; for the present, i shall mean by it whatever\\r\\noccurrences would commonly be called mental.\\r\\n\\r\\ni wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as i can what it is that\\r\\nreally takes place when we, e.g. believe or desire. in this first\\r\\nlecture i shall be concerned to refute a theory which is widely held,\\r\\nand which i formerly held myself: the theory that the essence of\\r\\neverything mental is a certain quite peculiar something called\\r\\n\"consciousness,\" conceived either as a relation to objects, or as a\\r\\npervading quality of psychical phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe reasons which i shall give against this theory will be mainly\\r\\nderived from previous authors. there are two sorts of reasons, which\\r\\nwill divide my lecture into two parts:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) direct reasons, derived from analysis and its difficulties;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) indirect reasons, derived from observation of animals (comparative\\r\\npsychology) and of the insane and hysterical (psycho-analysis).\\r\\n\\r\\nfew things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the\\r\\ndistinction between mind and matter. those who are not professional\\r\\nmetaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind\\r\\nactually is, or how matter is constituted; but they remain convinced\\r\\nthat there is an impassable gulf between the two, and that both belong\\r\\nto what actually exists in the world. philosophers, on the other hand,\\r\\nhave maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind,\\r\\nand sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter.\\r\\nthose who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are\\r\\ncalled \"idealists\"--a word which has a different meaning in philosophy\\r\\nfrom that which it bears in ordinary life. those who argue that matter\\r\\nis the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called\\r\\n\"materialists.\" they have been rare among philosophers, but common,\\r\\nat certain periods, among men of science. idealists, materialists, and\\r\\nordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point: that they knew\\r\\nsufficiently what they meant by the words \"mind\" and \"matter\" to be able\\r\\nto conduct their debate intelligently. yet it was just in this point, as\\r\\nto which they were at one, that they seem to me to have been all alike\\r\\nin error.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is, in my\\r\\nbelief, neither mind nor matter, but something more primitive than\\r\\neither. both mind and matter seem to be composite, and the stuff of\\r\\nwhich they are compounded lies in a sense between the two, in a sense\\r\\nabove them both, like a common ancestor. as regards matter, i have set\\r\\nforth my reasons for this view on former occasions,* and i shall not now\\r\\nrepeat them. but the question of mind is more difficult, and it is this\\r\\nquestion that i propose to discuss in these lectures. a great deal of\\r\\nwhat i shall have to say is not original; indeed, much recent work, in\\r\\nvarious fields, has tended to show the necessity of such theories as\\r\\nthose which i shall be advocating. accordingly in this first lecture\\r\\ni shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within\\r\\nwhich our investigation is to be carried on.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"our knowledge of the external world\" (allen & unwin),\\r\\n     chapters iii and iv. also \"mysticism and logic,\" essays vii\\r\\n     and viii.\\r\\n\\r\\nif there is one thing that may be said, in the popular estimation, to\\r\\ncharacterize mind, that one thing is \"consciousness.\" we say that we are\\r\\n\"conscious\" of what we see and hear, of what we remember, and of our own\\r\\nthoughts and feelings. most of us believe that tables and chairs are\\r\\nnot \"conscious.\" we think that when we sit in a chair, we are aware\\r\\nof sitting in it, but it is not aware of being sat in. it cannot for\\r\\na moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some\\r\\ndifference between us and the chair in this respect: so much may be\\r\\ntaken as fact, and as a datum for our inquiry. but as soon as we try to\\r\\nsay what exactly the difference is, we become involved in perplexities.\\r\\nis \"consciousness\" ultimate and simple, something to be merely accepted\\r\\nand contemplated? or is it something complex, perhaps consisting in our\\r\\nway of behaving in the presence of objects, or, alternatively, in the\\r\\nexistence in us of things called \"ideas,\" having a certain relation\\r\\nto objects, though different from them, and only symbolically\\r\\nrepresentative of them? such questions are not easy to answer; but until\\r\\nthey are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that\\r\\nwe are possessed of \"consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore considering modern theories, let us look first at consciousness\\r\\nfrom the standpoint of conventional psychology, since this embodies\\r\\nviews which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject.\\r\\nfor this purpose, let us as a preliminary consider different ways of\\r\\nbeing conscious.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, there is the way of perception. we \"perceive\" tables and chairs,\\r\\nhorses and dogs, our friends, traffic passing in the street--in short,\\r\\nanything which we recognize through the senses. i leave on one side for\\r\\nthe present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a\\r\\nform of consciousness: what i am speaking of now is perception, where,\\r\\naccording to conventional psychology, we go beyond the sensation to the\\r\\n\"thing\" which it represents. when you hear a donkey bray, you not only\\r\\nhear a noise, but realize that it comes from a donkey. when you see a\\r\\ntable, you not only see a coloured surface, but realize that it is hard.\\r\\nthe addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to\\r\\nconstitute perception. we shall have more to say about this at a later\\r\\nstage. for the moment, i am merely concerned to note that perception\\r\\nof objects is one of the most obvious examples of what is called\\r\\n\"consciousness.\" we are \"conscious\" of anything that we perceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may take next the way of memory. if i set to work to recall what\\r\\ni did this morning, that is a form of consciousness different from\\r\\nperception, since it is concerned with the past. there are various\\r\\nproblems as to how we can be conscious now of what no longer exists.\\r\\nthese will be dealt with incidentally when we come to the analysis of\\r\\nmemory.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom memory it is an easy step to what are called \"ideas\"--not in the\\r\\nplatonic sense, but in that of locke, berkeley and hume, in which they\\r\\nare opposed to \"impressions.\" you may be conscious of a friend either\\r\\nby seeing him or by \"thinking\" of him; and by \"thought\" you can be\\r\\nconscious of objects which cannot be seen, such as the human race,\\r\\nor physiology. \"thought\" in the narrower sense is that form of\\r\\nconsciousness which consists in \"ideas\" as opposed to impressions or\\r\\nmere memories.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may end our preliminary catalogue with belief, by which i mean that\\r\\nway of being conscious which may be either true or false. we say that a\\r\\nman is \"conscious of looking a fool,\" by which we mean that he believes\\r\\nhe looks a fool, and is not mistaken in this belief. this is a different\\r\\nform of consciousness from any of the earlier ones. it is the form which\\r\\ngives \"knowledge\" in the strict sense, and also error. it is, at least\\r\\napparently, more complex than our previous forms of consciousness;\\r\\nthough we shall find that they are not so separable from it as they\\r\\nmight appear to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nbesides ways of being conscious there are other things that would\\r\\nordinarily be called \"mental,\" such as desire and pleasure and pain.\\r\\nthese raise problems of their own, which we shall reach in lecture iii.\\r\\nbut the hardest problems are those that arise concerning ways of being\\r\\n\"conscious.\" these ways, taken together, are called the \"cognitive\"\\r\\nelements in mind, and it is these that will occupy us most during the\\r\\nfollowing lectures.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is one element which seems obviously in common among the different\\r\\nways of being conscious, and that is, that they are all directed to\\r\\nobjects. we are conscious \"of\" something. the consciousness, it seems,\\r\\nis one thing, and that of which we are conscious is another thing.\\r\\nunless we are to acquiesce in the view that we can never be conscious\\r\\nof anything outside our own minds, we must say that the object of\\r\\nconsciousness need not be mental, though the consciousness must be. (i\\r\\nam speaking within the circle of conventional doctrines, not expressing\\r\\nmy own beliefs.) this direction towards an object is commonly regarded\\r\\nas typical of every form of cognition, and sometimes of mental life\\r\\naltogether. we may distinguish two different tendencies in traditional\\r\\npsychology. there are those who take mental phenomena naively, just as\\r\\nthey would physical phenomena. this school of psychologists tends not to\\r\\nemphasize the object. on the other hand, there are those whose primary\\r\\ninterest is in the apparent fact that we have knowledge, that there is a\\r\\nworld surrounding us of which we are aware. these men are interested in\\r\\nthe mind because of its relation to the world, because knowledge, if\\r\\nit is a fact, is a very mysterious one. their interest in psychology\\r\\nis naturally centred in the relation of consciousness to its object, a\\r\\nproblem which, properly, belongs rather to theory of knowledge. we may\\r\\ntake as one of the best and most typical representatives of this school\\r\\nthe austrian psychologist brentano, whose \"psychology from the empirical\\r\\nstandpoint,\"* though published in 1874, is still influential and was the\\r\\nstarting-point of a great deal of interesting work. he says (p. 115):\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"psychologie vom empirischen standpunkte,\" vol. i, 1874.\\r\\n     (the second volume was never published.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"every psychical phenomenon is characterized by what the scholastics of\\r\\nthe middle ages called the intentional (also the mental) inexistence of\\r\\nan object, and what we, although with not quite unambiguous expressions,\\r\\nwould call relation to a content, direction towards an object (which is\\r\\nnot here to be understood as a reality), or immanent objectivity. each\\r\\ncontains something in itself as an object, though not each in the same\\r\\nway. in presentation something is presented, in judgment something is\\r\\nacknowledged or rejected, in love something is loved, in hatred hated,\\r\\nin desire desired, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"this intentional inexistence is exclusively peculiar to psychical\\r\\nphenomena. no physical phenomenon shows anything similar. and so we\\r\\ncan define psychical phenomena by saying that they are phenomena which\\r\\nintentionally contain an object in themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view here expressed, that relation to an object is an ultimate\\r\\nirreducible characteristic of mental phenomena, is one which i shall be\\r\\nconcerned to combat. like brentano, i am interested in psychology, not\\r\\nso much for its own sake, as for the light that it may throw on the\\r\\nproblem of knowledge. until very lately i believed, as he did, that\\r\\nmental phenomena have essential reference to objects, except possibly in\\r\\nthe case of pleasure and pain. now i no longer believe this, even in\\r\\nthe case of knowledge. i shall try to make my reasons for this rejection\\r\\nclear as we proceed. it must be evident at first glance that the\\r\\nanalysis of knowledge is rendered more difficult by the rejection; but\\r\\nthe apparent simplicity of brentano\\'s view of knowledge will be found,\\r\\nif i am not mistaken, incapable of maintaining itself either against\\r\\nan analytic scrutiny or against a host of facts in psycho-analysis and\\r\\nanimal psychology. i do not wish to minimize the problems. i will\\r\\nmerely observe, in mitigation of our prospective labours, that thinking,\\r\\nhowever it is to be analysed, is in itself a delightful occupation,\\r\\nand that there is no enemy to thinking so deadly as a false simplicity.\\r\\ntravelling, whether in the mental or the physical world, is a joy, and\\r\\nit is good to know that, in the mental world at least, there are vast\\r\\ncountries still very imperfectly explored.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view expressed by brentano has been held very generally, and\\r\\ndeveloped by many writers. among these we may take as an example his\\r\\naustrian successor meinong.* according to him there are three elements\\r\\ninvolved in the thought of an object. these three he calls the act, the\\r\\ncontent and the object. the act is the same in any two cases of the same\\r\\nkind of consciousness; for instance, if i think of smith or think\\r\\nof brown, the act of thinking, in itself, is exactly similar on both\\r\\noccasions. but the content of my thought, the particular event that\\r\\nis happening in my mind, is different when i think of smith and when i\\r\\nthink of brown. the content, meinong argues, must not be confounded with\\r\\nthe object, since the content must exist in my mind at the moment when\\r\\ni have the thought, whereas the object need not do so. the object may\\r\\nbe something past or future; it may be physical, not mental; it may\\r\\nbe something abstract, like equality for example; it may be something\\r\\nimaginary, like a golden mountain; or it may even be something\\r\\nself-contradictory, like a round square. but in all these cases, so\\r\\nhe contends, the content exists when the thought exists, and is what\\r\\ndistinguishes it, as an occurrence, from other thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see, e.g. his article: \"ueber gegenstande hoherer ordnung\\r\\n     und deren verhaltniss zur inneren wahrnehmung,\" \"zeitschrift\\r\\n     fur psychologie and physiologie der sinnesorgane,\" vol. xxi,\\r\\n     pp. 182-272 (1899), especially pp. 185-8.\\r\\n\\r\\nto make this theory concrete, let us suppose that you are thinking of\\r\\nst. paul\\'s. then, according to meinong, we have to distinguish three\\r\\nelements which are necessarily combined in constituting the one thought.\\r\\nfirst, there is the act of thinking, which would be just the same\\r\\nwhatever you were thinking about. then there is what makes the character\\r\\nof the thought as contrasted with other thoughts; this is the content.\\r\\nand finally there is st. paul\\'s, which is the object of your thought.\\r\\nthere must be a difference between the content of a thought and what it\\r\\nis about, since the thought is here and now, whereas what it is about\\r\\nmay not be; hence it is clear that the thought is not identical with st.\\r\\npaul\\'s. this seems to show that we must distinguish between content\\r\\nand object. but if meinong is right, there can be no thought without an\\r\\nobject: the connection of the two is essential. the object might exist\\r\\nwithout the thought, but not the thought without the object: the three\\r\\nelements of act, content and object are all required to constitute the\\r\\none single occurrence called \"thinking of st. paul\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above analysis of a thought, though i believe it to be mistaken, is\\r\\nvery useful as affording a schema in terms of which other theories can\\r\\nbe stated. in the remainder of the present lecture i shall state in\\r\\noutline the view which i advocate, and show how various other views\\r\\nout of which mine has grown result from modifications of the threefold\\r\\nanalysis into act, content and object.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first criticism i have to make is that the act seems unnecessary and\\r\\nfictitious. the occurrence of the content of a thought constitutes\\r\\nthe occurrence of the thought. empirically, i cannot discover anything\\r\\ncorresponding to the supposed act; and theoretically i cannot see that\\r\\nit is indispensable. we say: \"_i_ think so-and-so,\" and this word \"i\"\\r\\nsuggests that thinking is the act of a person. meinong\\'s \"act\" is the\\r\\nghost of the subject, or what once was the full-blooded soul. it is\\r\\nsupposed that thoughts cannot just come and go, but need a person to\\r\\nthink them. now, of course it is true that thoughts can be collected\\r\\ninto bundles, so that one bundle is my thoughts, another is your\\r\\nthoughts, and a third is the thoughts of mr. jones. but i think\\r\\nthe person is not an ingredient in the single thought: he is rather\\r\\nconstituted by relations of the thoughts to each other and to the body.\\r\\nthis is a large question, which need not, in its entirety, concern us\\r\\nat present. all that i am concerned with for the moment is that the\\r\\ngrammatical forms \"i think,\" \"you think,\" and \"mr. jones thinks,\" are\\r\\nmisleading if regarded as indicating an analysis of a single thought.\\r\\nit would be better to say \"it thinks in me,\" like \"it rains here\"; or\\r\\nbetter still, \"there is a thought in me.\" this is simply on the\\r\\nground that what meinong calls the act in thinking is not empirically\\r\\ndiscoverable, or logically deducible from what we can observe.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next point of criticism concerns the relation of content and object.\\r\\nthe reference of thoughts to objects is not, i believe, the simple\\r\\ndirect essential thing that brentano and meinong represent it as being.\\r\\nit seems to me to be derivative, and to consist largely in beliefs:\\r\\nbeliefs that what constitutes the thought is connected with various\\r\\nother elements which together make up the object. you have, say, an\\r\\nimage of st. paul\\'s, or merely the word \"st. paul\\'s\" in your head. you\\r\\nbelieve, however vaguely and dimly, that this is connected with what\\r\\nyou would see if you went to st. paul\\'s, or what you would feel if you\\r\\ntouched its walls; it is further connected with what other people see\\r\\nand feel, with services and the dean and chapter and sir christopher\\r\\nwren. these things are not mere thoughts of yours, but your thought\\r\\nstands in a relation to them of which you are more or less aware. the\\r\\nawareness of this relation is a further thought, and constitutes\\r\\nyour feeling that the original thought had an \"object.\" but in pure\\r\\nimagination you can get very similar thoughts without these accompanying\\r\\nbeliefs; and in this case your thoughts do not have objects or seem to\\r\\nhave them. thus in such instances you have content without object. on\\r\\nthe other hand, in seeing or hearing it would be less misleading to\\r\\nsay that you have object without content, since what you see or hear is\\r\\nactually part of the physical world, though not matter in the sense of\\r\\nphysics. thus the whole question of the relation of mental occurrences\\r\\nto objects grows very complicated, and cannot be settled by regarding\\r\\nreference to objects as of the essence of thoughts. all the above\\r\\nremarks are merely preliminary, and will be expanded later.\\r\\n\\r\\nspeaking in popular and unphilosophical terms, we may say that the\\r\\ncontent of a thought is supposed to be something in your head when you\\r\\nthink the thought, while the object is usually something in the outer\\r\\nworld. it is held that knowledge of the outer world is constituted by\\r\\nthe relation to the object, while the fact that knowledge is different\\r\\nfrom what it knows is due to the fact that knowledge comes by way of\\r\\ncontents. we can begin to state the difference between realism and\\r\\nidealism in terms of this opposition of contents and objects. speaking\\r\\nquite roughly and approximately, we may say that idealism tends to\\r\\nsuppress the object, while realism tends to suppress the content.\\r\\nidealism, accordingly, says that nothing can be known except thoughts,\\r\\nand all the reality that we know is mental; while realism maintains that\\r\\nwe know objects directly, in sensation certainly, and perhaps also in\\r\\nmemory and thought. idealism does not say that nothing can be known\\r\\nbeyond the present thought, but it maintains that the context of vague\\r\\nbelief, which we spoke of in connection with the thought of st. paul\\'s,\\r\\nonly takes you to other thoughts, never to anything radically different\\r\\nfrom thoughts. the difficulty of this view is in regard to sensation,\\r\\nwhere it seems as if we came into direct contact with the outer world.\\r\\nbut the berkeleian way of meeting this difficulty is so familiar that i\\r\\nneed not enlarge upon it now. i shall return to it in a later lecture,\\r\\nand will only observe, for the present, that there seem to me no valid\\r\\ngrounds for regarding what we see and hear as not part of the physical\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nrealists, on the other hand, as a rule, suppress the content, and\\r\\nmaintain that a thought consists either of act and object alone, or of\\r\\nobject alone. i have been in the past a realist, and i remain a realist\\r\\nas regards sensation, but not as regards memory or thought. i will try\\r\\nto explain what seem to me to be the reasons for and against various\\r\\nkinds of realism.\\r\\n\\r\\nmodern idealism professes to be by no means confined to the present\\r\\nthought or the present thinker in regard to its knowledge; indeed, it\\r\\ncontends that the world is so organic, so dove-tailed, that from any\\r\\none portion the whole can be inferred, as the complete skeleton of an\\r\\nextinct animal can be inferred from one bone. but the logic by which\\r\\nthis supposed organic nature of the world is nominally demonstrated\\r\\nappears to realists, as it does to me, to be faulty. they argue that,\\r\\nif we cannot know the physical world directly, we cannot really know\\r\\nany thing outside our own minds: the rest of the world may be merely our\\r\\ndream. this is a dreary view, and they there fore seek ways of escaping\\r\\nfrom it. accordingly they maintain that in knowledge we are in direct\\r\\ncontact with objects, which may be, and usually are, outside our own\\r\\nminds. no doubt they are prompted to this view, in the first place, by\\r\\nbias, namely, by the desire to think that they can know of the existence\\r\\nof a world outside themselves. but we have to consider, not what led\\r\\nthem to desire the view, but whether their arguments for it are valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two different kinds of realism, according as we make a thought\\r\\nconsist of act and object, or of object alone. their difficulties are\\r\\ndifferent, but neither seems tenable all through. take, for the sake of\\r\\ndefiniteness, the remembering of a past event. the remembering occurs\\r\\nnow, and is therefore necessarily not identical with the past event.\\r\\nso long as we retain the act, this need cause no difficulty. the act\\r\\nof remembering occurs now, and has on this view a certain essential\\r\\nrelation to the past event which it remembers. there is no logical\\r\\nobjection to this theory, but there is the objection, which we spoke\\r\\nof earlier, that the act seems mythical, and is not to be found by\\r\\nobservation. if, on the other hand, we try to constitute memory without\\r\\nthe act, we are driven to a content, since we must have something that\\r\\nhappens now, as opposed to the event which happened in the past. thus,\\r\\nwhen we reject the act, which i think we must, we are driven to a theory\\r\\nof memory which is more akin to idealism. these arguments, however, do\\r\\nnot apply to sensation. it is especially sensation, i think, which is\\r\\nconsidered by those realists who retain only the object.* their views,\\r\\nwhich are chiefly held in america, are in large measure derived from\\r\\nwilliam james, and before going further it will be well to consider\\r\\nthe revolutionary doctrine which he advocated. i believe this doctrine\\r\\ncontains important new truth, and what i shall have to say will be in a\\r\\nconsiderable measure inspired by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * this is explicitly the case with mach\\'s \"analysis of\\r\\n     sensations,\" a book of fundamental importance in the present\\r\\n     connection. (translation of fifth german edition, open court\\r\\n     co., 1914. first german edition, 1886.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwilliam james\\'s view was first set forth in an essay called \"does\\r\\n\\'consciousness\\' exist?\"* in this essay he explains how what used to be\\r\\nthe soul has gradually been refined down to the \"transcendental ego,\"\\r\\nwhich, he says, \"attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly condition,\\r\\nbeing only a name for the fact that the \\'content\\' of experience is\\r\\nknown. it loses personal form and activity--these passing over to the\\r\\ncontent--and becomes a bare bewusstheit or bewusstsein uberhaupt, of\\r\\nwhich in its own right absolutely nothing can be said. i believe (he\\r\\ncontinues) that \\'consciousness,\\' when once it has evaporated to this\\r\\nestate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of disappearing altogether.\\r\\nit is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first\\r\\nprinciples. those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo,\\r\\nthe faint rumour left behind by the disappearing \\'soul\\' upon the air of\\r\\nphilosophy\"(p. 2).\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"journal of philosophy, psychology and scientific\\r\\n     methods,\" vol. i, 1904. reprinted in \"essays in radical\\r\\n     empiricism\" (longmans, green & co., 1912), pp. 1-38, to\\r\\n     which references in what follows refer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhe explains that this is no sudden change in his opinions. \"for twenty\\r\\nyears past,\" he says, \"i have mistrusted \\'consciousness\\' as an entity;\\r\\nfor seven or eight years past i have suggested its non-existence to my\\r\\nstudents, and tried to give them its pragmatic equivalent in realities\\r\\nof experience. it seems to me that the hour is ripe for it to be openly\\r\\nand universally discarded\"(p. 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nhis next concern is to explain away the air of paradox, for james\\r\\nwas never wilfully paradoxical. \"undeniably,\" he says, \"\\'thoughts\\' do\\r\\nexist.\" \"i mean only to deny that the word stands for an entity, but to\\r\\ninsist most emphatically that it does stand for a function. there is, i\\r\\nmean, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of\\r\\nwhich material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are\\r\\nmade; but there is a function in experience which thoughts perform,\\r\\nand for the performance of which this quality of being is invoked. that\\r\\nfunction is knowing\"(pp. 3-4).\\r\\n\\r\\njames\\'s view is that the raw material out of which the world is built\\r\\nup is not of two sorts, one matter and the other mind, but that it is\\r\\narranged in different patterns by its inter-relations, and that some\\r\\narrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"my thesis is,\" he says, \"that if we start with the supposition that\\r\\nthere is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff\\r\\nof which everything is composed, and if we call that stuff \\'pure\\r\\nexperience,\\' then knowing can easily be explained as a particular sort\\r\\nof relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience\\r\\nmay enter. the relation itself is a part of pure experience; one of its\\r\\n\\'terms\\' becomes the subject or bearer of the knowledge, the knower, the\\r\\nother becomes the object known\"(p. 4).\\r\\n\\r\\nafter mentioning the duality of subject and object, which is supposed\\r\\nto constitute consciousness, he proceeds in italics: \"experience, i\\r\\nbelieve, has no such inner duplicity; and the separation of it into\\r\\nconsciousness and content comes, not by way of subtraction, but by way\\r\\nof addition\"(p. 9).\\r\\n\\r\\nhe illustrates his meaning by the analogy of paint as it appears in a\\r\\npaint-shop and as it appears in a picture: in the one case it is just\\r\\n\"saleable matter,\" while in the other it \"performs a spiritual function.\\r\\njust so, i maintain (he continues), does a given undivided portion\\r\\nof experience, taken in one context of associates, play the part of a\\r\\nknower, of a state of mind, of \\'consciousness\\'; while in a different\\r\\ncontext the same undivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing\\r\\nknown, of an objective \\'content.\\' in a word, in one group it figures as\\r\\na thought, in another group as a thing\"(pp. 9-10).\\r\\n\\r\\nhe does not believe in the supposed immediate certainty of thought. \"let\\r\\nthe case be what it may in others,\" he says, \"i am as confident as i am\\r\\nof anything that, in myself, the stream of thinking (which i recognize\\r\\nemphatically as a phenomenon) is only a careless name for what, when\\r\\nscrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of my\\r\\nbreathing. the \\'i think\\' which kant said must be able to accompany all\\r\\nmy objects, is the \\'i breathe\\' which actually does accompany them\"(pp.\\r\\n36-37).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same view of \"consciousness\" is set forth in the succeeding essay,\\r\\n\"a world of pure experience\" (ib., pp. 39-91). the use of the phrase\\r\\n\"pure experience\" in both essays points to a lingering influence of\\r\\nidealism. \"experience,\" like \"consciousness,\" must be a product, not\\r\\npart of the primary stuff of the world. it must be possible, if james is\\r\\nright in his main contentions, that roughly the same stuff, differently\\r\\narranged, would not give rise to anything that could be called\\r\\n\"experience.\" this word has been dropped by the american realists, among\\r\\nwhom we may mention specially professor r. b. perry of harvard and mr.\\r\\nedwin b. holt. the interests of this school are in general philosophy\\r\\nand the philosophy of the sciences, rather than in psychology; they have\\r\\nderived a strong impulsion from james, but have more interest than he\\r\\nhad in logic and mathematics and the abstract part of philosophy. they\\r\\nspeak of \"neutral\" entities as the stuff out of which both mind and\\r\\nmatter are constructed. thus holt says: \"if the terms and propositions\\r\\nof logic must be substantialized, they are all strictly of one\\r\\nsubstance, for which perhaps the least dangerous name is neutral-stuff.\\r\\nthe relation of neutral-stuff to matter and mind we shall have presently\\r\\nto consider at considerable length.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"the concept of consciousness\" (geo. allen & co., 1914),\\r\\n     p. 52.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy own belief--for which the reasons will appear in subsequent\\r\\nlectures--is that james is right in rejecting consciousness as an\\r\\nentity, and that the american realists are partly right, though not\\r\\nwholly, in considering that both mind and matter are composed of a\\r\\nneutral-stuff which, in isolation, is neither mental nor material. i\\r\\nshould admit this view as regards sensations: what is heard or seen\\r\\nbelongs equally to psychology and to physics. but i should say that\\r\\nimages belong only to the mental world, while those occurrences (if any)\\r\\nwhich do not form part of any \"experience\" belong only to the physical\\r\\nworld. there are, it seems to me, prima facie different kinds of causal\\r\\nlaws, one belonging to physics and the other to psychology. the law\\r\\nof gravitation, for example, is a physical law, while the law of\\r\\nassociation is a psychological law. sensations are subject to both kinds\\r\\nof laws, and are therefore truly \"neutral\" in holt\\'s sense. but entities\\r\\nsubject only to physical laws, or only to psychological laws, are not\\r\\nneutral, and may be called respectively purely material and purely\\r\\nmental. even those, however, which are purely mental will not have that\\r\\nintrinsic reference to objects which brentano assigns to them and which\\r\\nconstitutes the essence of \"consciousness\" as ordinarily understood. but\\r\\nit is now time to pass on to other modern tendencies, also hostile to\\r\\n\"consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a psychological school called \"behaviourists,\" of whom the\\r\\nprotagonist is professor john b. watson,* formerly of the johns hopkins\\r\\nuniversity. to them also, on the whole, belongs professor john dewey,\\r\\nwho, with james and dr. schiller, was one of the three founders of\\r\\npragmatism. the view of the \"behaviourists\" is that nothing can be known\\r\\nexcept by external observation. they deny altogether that there is a\\r\\nseparate source of knowledge called \"introspection,\" by which we can\\r\\nknow things about ourselves which we could never observe in others.\\r\\nthey do not by any means deny that all sorts of things may go on in\\r\\nour minds: they only say that such things, if they occur, are not\\r\\nsusceptible of scientific observation, and do not therefore concern\\r\\npsychology as a science. psychology as a science, they say, is only\\r\\nconcerned with behaviour, i.e. with what we do; this alone, they\\r\\ncontend, can be accurately observed. whether we think meanwhile, they\\r\\ntell us, cannot be known; in their observation of the behaviour of human\\r\\nbeings, they have not so far found any evidence of thought. true, we\\r\\ntalk a great deal, and imagine that in so doing we are showing that we\\r\\ncan think; but behaviourists say that the talk they have to listen to\\r\\ncan be explained without supposing that people think. where you might\\r\\nexpect a chapter on \"thought processes\" you come instead upon a chapter\\r\\non \"the language habit.\" it is humiliating to find how terribly adequate\\r\\nthis hypothesis turns out to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see especially his \"behavior: an introduction to\\r\\n     comparative psychology,\" new york, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nbehaviourism has not, however, sprung from observing the folly of men.\\r\\nit is the wisdom of animals that has suggested the view. it has always\\r\\nbeen a common topic of popular discussion whether animals \"think.\" on\\r\\nthis topic people are prepared to take sides without having the vaguest\\r\\nidea what they mean by \"thinking.\" those who desired to investigate such\\r\\nquestions were led to observe the behaviour of animals, in the hope that\\r\\ntheir behaviour would throw some light on their mental faculties.\\r\\nat first sight, it might seem that this is so. people say that a\\r\\ndog \"knows\" its name because it comes when it is called, and that it\\r\\n\"remembers\" its master, because it looks sad in his absence, but wags\\r\\nits tail and barks when he returns. that the dog behaves in this way is\\r\\nmatter of observation, but that it \"knows\" or \"remembers\" anything is an\\r\\ninference, and in fact a very doubtful one. the more such inferences are\\r\\nexamined, the more precarious they are seen to be. hence the study of\\r\\nanimal behaviour has been gradually led to abandon all attempt at mental\\r\\ninterpretation. and it can hardly be doubted that, in many cases of\\r\\ncomplicated behaviour very well adapted to its ends, there can be no\\r\\nprevision of those ends. the first time a bird builds a nest, we can\\r\\nhardly suppose it knows that there will be eggs to be laid in it, or\\r\\nthat it will sit on the eggs, or that they will hatch into young birds.\\r\\nit does what it does at each stage because instinct gives it an impulse\\r\\nto do just that, not because it foresees and desires the result of its\\r\\nactions.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * an interesting discussion of the question whether\\r\\n     instinctive actions, when first performed, involve any\\r\\n     prevision, however vague, will be found in lloyd morgan\\'s\\r\\n     \"instinct and experience\" (methuen, 1912), chap. ii.\\r\\n\\r\\ncareful observers of animals, being anxious to avoid precarious\\r\\ninferences, have gradually discovered more and more how to give\\r\\nan account of the actions of animals without assuming what we call\\r\\n\"consciousness.\" it has seemed to the behaviourists that similar methods\\r\\ncan be applied to human behaviour, without assuming anything not open\\r\\nto external observation. let us give a crude illustration, too crude for\\r\\nthe authors in question, but capable of affording a rough insight into\\r\\ntheir meaning. suppose two children in a school, both of whom are asked\\r\\n\"what is six times nine?\" one says fifty-four, the other says fifty-six.\\r\\nthe one, we say, \"knows\" what six times nine is, the other does not. but\\r\\nall that we can observe is a certain language-habit. the one child has\\r\\nacquired the habit of saying \"six times nine is fifty-four\"; the other\\r\\nhas not. there is no more need of \"thought\" in this than there is when\\r\\na horse turns into his accustomed stable; there are merely more numerous\\r\\nand complicated habits. there is obviously an observable fact called\\r\\n\"knowing\" such-and-such a thing; examinations are experiments for\\r\\ndiscovering such facts. but all that is observed or discovered is a\\r\\ncertain set of habits in the use of words. the thoughts (if any) in the\\r\\nmind of the examinee are of no interest to the examiner; nor has the\\r\\nexaminer any reason to suppose even the most successful examinee capable\\r\\nof even the smallest amount of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus what is called \"knowing,\" in the sense in which we can ascertain\\r\\nwhat other people \"know,\" is a phenomenon exemplified in their physical\\r\\nbehaviour, including spoken and written words. there is no reason--so\\r\\nwatson argues--to suppose that their knowledge is anything beyond the\\r\\nhabits shown in this behaviour: the inference that other people\\r\\nhave something nonphysical called \"mind\" or \"thought\" is therefore\\r\\nunwarranted.\\r\\n\\r\\nso far, there is nothing particularly repugnant to our prejudices in the\\r\\nconclusions of the behaviourists. we are all willing to admit that\\r\\nother people are thoughtless. but when it comes to ourselves, we feel\\r\\nconvinced that we can actually perceive our own thinking. \"cogito, ergo\\r\\nsum\" would be regarded by most people as having a true premiss. this,\\r\\nhowever, the behaviourist denies. he maintains that our knowledge of\\r\\nourselves is no different in kind from our knowledge of other people.\\r\\nwe may see more, because our own body is easier to observe than that of\\r\\nother people; but we do not see anything radically unlike what we see\\r\\nof others. introspection, as a separate source of knowledge, is entirely\\r\\ndenied by psychologists of this school. i shall discuss this question at\\r\\nlength in a later lecture; for the present i will only observe that\\r\\nit is by no means simple, and that, though i believe the behaviourists\\r\\nsomewhat overstate their case, yet there is an important element of\\r\\ntruth in their contention, since the things which we can discover by\\r\\nintrospection do not seem to differ in any very fundamental way from the\\r\\nthings which we discover by external observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nso far, we have been principally concerned with knowing. but it might\\r\\nwell be maintained that desiring is what is really most characteristic\\r\\nof mind. human beings are constantly engaged in achieving some end\\r\\nthey feel pleasure in success and pain in failure. in a purely material\\r\\nworld, it may be said, there would be no opposition of pleasant and\\r\\nunpleasant, good and bad, what is desired and what is feared. a man\\'s\\r\\nacts are governed by purposes. he decides, let us suppose, to go to a\\r\\ncertain place, whereupon he proceeds to the station, takes his ticket\\r\\nand enters the train. if the usual route is blocked by an accident,\\r\\nhe goes by some other route. all that he does is determined--or so it\\r\\nseems--by the end he has in view, by what lies in front of him, rather\\r\\nthan by what lies behind. with dead matter, this is not the case.\\r\\na stone at the top of a hill may start rolling, but it shows no\\r\\npertinacity in trying to get to the bottom. any ledge or obstacle will\\r\\nstop it, and it will exhibit no signs of discontent if this happens. it\\r\\nis not attracted by the pleasantness of the valley, as a sheep or cow\\r\\nmight be, but propelled by the steepness of the hill at the place\\r\\nwhere it is. in all this we have characteristic differences between the\\r\\nbehaviour of animals and the behaviour of matter as studied by physics.\\r\\n\\r\\ndesire, like knowledge, is, of course, in one sense an observable\\r\\nphenomenon. an elephant will eat a bun, but not a mutton chop; a duck\\r\\nwill go into the water, but a hen will not. but when we think of our\\r\\nown desires, most people believe that we can know them by an immediate\\r\\nself-knowledge which does not depend upon observation of our actions.\\r\\nyet if this were the case, it would be odd that people are so often\\r\\nmistaken as to what they desire. it is matter of common observation that\\r\\n\"so-and-so does not know his own motives,\" or that \"a is envious of b\\r\\nand malicious about him, but quite unconscious of being so.\" such people\\r\\nare called self-deceivers, and are supposed to have had to go through\\r\\nsome more or less elaborate process of concealing from themselves what\\r\\nwould otherwise have been obvious. i believe that this is an entire\\r\\nmistake. i believe that the discovery of our own motives can only be\\r\\nmade by the same process by which we discover other people\\'s, namely,\\r\\nthe process of observing our actions and inferring the desire which\\r\\ncould prompt them. a desire is \"conscious\" when we have told ourselves\\r\\nthat we have it. a hungry man may say to himself: \"oh, i do want my\\r\\nlunch.\" then his desire is \"conscious.\" but it only differs from an\\r\\n\"unconscious\" desire by the presence of appropriate words, which is by\\r\\nno means a fundamental difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe belief that a motive is normally conscious makes it easier to be\\r\\nmistaken as to our own motives than as to other people\\'s. when some\\r\\ndesire that we should be ashamed of is attributed to us, we notice that\\r\\nwe have never had it consciously, in the sense of saying to ourselves,\\r\\n\"i wish that would happen.\" we therefore look for some other\\r\\ninterpretation of our actions, and regard our friends as very unjust\\r\\nwhen they refuse to be convinced by our repudiation of what we hold to\\r\\nbe a calumny. moral considerations greatly increase the difficulty of\\r\\nclear thinking in this matter. it is commonly argued that people are not\\r\\nto blame for unconscious motives, but only for conscious ones. in order,\\r\\ntherefore, to be wholly virtuous it is only necessary to repeat virtuous\\r\\nformulas. we say: \"i desire to be kind to my friends, honourable in\\r\\nbusiness, philanthropic towards the poor, public-spirited in politics.\"\\r\\nso long as we refuse to allow ourselves, even in the watches of the\\r\\nnight, to avow any contrary desires, we may be bullies at home, shady in\\r\\nthe city, skinflints in paying wages and profiteers in dealing with the\\r\\npublic; yet, if only conscious motives are to count in moral valuation,\\r\\nwe shall remain model characters. this is an agreeable doctrine, and\\r\\nit is not surprising that men are un willing to abandon it. but moral\\r\\nconsiderations are the worst enemies of the scientific spirit and we\\r\\nmust dismiss them from our minds if we wish to arrive at truth.\\r\\n\\r\\ni believe--as i shall try to prove in a later lecture--that desire,\\r\\nlike force in mechanics, is of the nature of a convenient fiction\\r\\nfor describing shortly certain laws of behaviour. a hungry animal is\\r\\nrestless until it finds food; then it becomes quiescent. the thing which\\r\\nwill bring a restless condition to an end is said to be what is desired.\\r\\nbut only experience can show what will have this sedative effect, and it\\r\\nis easy to make mistakes. we feel dissatisfaction, and think that\\r\\nsuch and-such a thing would remove it; but in thinking this, we are\\r\\ntheorizing, not observing a patent fact. our theorizing is often\\r\\nmistaken, and when it is mistaken there is a difference between what we\\r\\nthink we desire and what in fact will bring satisfaction. this is such\\r\\na common phenomenon that any theory of desire which fails to account for\\r\\nit must be wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat have been called \"unconscious\" desires have been brought very much\\r\\nto the fore in recent years by psycho-analysis. psycho-analysis, as\\r\\nevery one knows, is primarily a method of understanding hysteria and\\r\\ncertain forms of insanity*; but it has been found that there is much\\r\\nin the lives of ordinary men and women which bears a humiliating\\r\\nresemblance to the delusions of the insane. the connection of dreams,\\r\\nirrational beliefs and foolish actions with unconscious wishes has been\\r\\nbrought to light, though with some exaggeration, by freud and jung and\\r\\ntheir followers. as regards the nature of these unconscious wishes,\\r\\nit seems to me--though as a layman i speak with diffidence--that many\\r\\npsycho-analysts are unduly narrow; no doubt the wishes they emphasize\\r\\nexist, but others, e.g. for honour and power, are equally operative and\\r\\nequally liable to concealment. this, however, does not affect the\\r\\nvalue of their general theories from the point of view of theoretic\\r\\npsychology, and it is from this point of view that their results are\\r\\nimportant for the analysis of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * there is a wide field of \"unconscious\" phenomena which\\r\\n     does not depend upon psycho-analytic theories. such\\r\\n     occurrences as automatic writing lead dr. morton prince to\\r\\n     say: \"as i view this question of the subconscious, far too\\r\\n     much weight is given to the point of awareness or not\\r\\n     awareness of our conscious processes. as a matter of fact,\\r\\n     we find entirely identical phenomena, that is, identical in\\r\\n     every respect but one-that of awareness in which sometimes\\r\\n     we are aware of these conscious phenomena and sometimes\\r\\n     not\"(p. 87 of \"subconscious phenomena,\" by various authors,\\r\\n     rebman). dr. morton price conceives that there may be\\r\\n     \"consciousness\" without \"awareness.\" but this is a difficult\\r\\n     view, and one which makes some definition of \"consciousness\"\\r\\n     imperative. for nay part, i cannot see how to separate\\r\\n     consciousness from awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat, i think, is clearly established, is that a man\\'s actions and\\r\\nbeliefs may be wholly dominated by a desire of which he is quite\\r\\nunconscious, and which he indignantly repudiates when it is suggested\\r\\nto him. such a desire is generally, in morbid cases, of a sort which\\r\\nthe patient would consider wicked; if he had to admit that he had the\\r\\ndesire, he would loathe himself. yet it is so strong that it must force\\r\\nan outlet for itself; hence it becomes necessary to entertain whole\\r\\nsystems of false beliefs in order to hide the nature of what is desired.\\r\\nthe resulting delusions in very many cases disappear if the hysteric or\\r\\nlunatic can be made to face the facts about himself. the consequence\\r\\nof this is that the treatment of many forms of insanity has grown more\\r\\npsychological and less physiological than it used to be. instead of\\r\\nlooking for a physical defect in the brain, those who treat delusions\\r\\nlook for the repressed desire which has found this contorted mode\\r\\nof expression. for those who do not wish to plunge into the somewhat\\r\\nrepulsive and often rather wild theories of psychoanalytic pioneers, it\\r\\nwill be worth while to read a little book by dr. bernard hart on \"the\\r\\npsychology of insanity.\"* on this question of the mental as opposed to\\r\\nthe physiological study of the causes of insanity, dr. hart says:\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cambridge, 1912; 2nd edition, 1914. the following\\r\\n     references are to the second edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the psychological conception [of insanity] is based on the view that\\r\\nmental processes can be directly studied without any reference to the\\r\\naccompanying changes which are presumed to take place in the brain, and\\r\\nthat insanity may therefore be properly attacked from the standpoint of\\r\\npsychology\"(p. 9).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis illustrates a point which i am anxious to make clear from the\\r\\noutset. any attempt to classify modern views, such as i propose to\\r\\nadvocate, from the old standpoint of materialism and idealism, is only\\r\\nmisleading. in certain respects, the views which i shall be setting\\r\\nforth approximate to materialism; in certain others, they approximate to\\r\\nits opposite. on this question of the study of delusions, the practical\\r\\neffect of the modern theories, as dr. hart points out, is emancipation\\r\\nfrom the materialist method. on the other hand, as he also points\\r\\nout (pp. 38-9), imbecility and dementia still have to be considered\\r\\nphysiologically, as caused by defects in the brain. there is no\\r\\ninconsistency in this if, as we maintain, mind and matter are neither of\\r\\nthem the actual stuff of reality, but different convenient groupings of\\r\\nan underlying material, then, clearly, the question whether, in regard\\r\\nto a given phenomenon, we are to seek a physical or a mental cause, is\\r\\nmerely one to be decided by trial. metaphysicians have argued endlessly\\r\\nas to the interaction of mind and matter. the followers of descartes\\r\\nheld that mind and matter are so different as to make any action of the\\r\\none on the other impossible. when i will to move my arm, they said,\\r\\nit is not my will that operates on my arm, but god, who, by his\\r\\nomnipotence, moves my arm whenever i want it moved. the modern doctrine\\r\\nof psychophysical parallelism is not appreciably different from this\\r\\ntheory of the cartesian school. psycho-physical parallelism is the\\r\\ntheory that mental and physical events each have causes in their own\\r\\nsphere, but run on side by side owing to the fact that every state of\\r\\nthe brain coexists with a definite state of the mind, and vice versa.\\r\\nthis view of the reciprocal causal independence of mind and matter has\\r\\nno basis except in metaphysical theory.* for us, there is no necessity\\r\\nto make any such assumption, which is very difficult to harmonize with\\r\\nobvious facts. i receive a letter inviting me to dinner: the letter is\\r\\na physical fact, but my apprehension of its meaning is mental. here we\\r\\nhave an effect of matter on mind. in consequence of my apprehension of\\r\\nthe meaning of the letter, i go to the right place at the right time;\\r\\nhere we have an effect of mind on matter. i shall try to persuade you,\\r\\nin the course of these lectures, that matter is not so material and mind\\r\\nnot so mental as is generally supposed. when we are speaking of matter,\\r\\nit will seem as if we were inclining to idealism; when we are speaking\\r\\nof mind, it will seem as if we were inclining to materialism. neither\\r\\nis the truth. our world is to be constructed out of what the american\\r\\nrealists call \"neutral\" entities, which have neither the hardness and\\r\\nindestructibility of matter, nor the reference to objects which is\\r\\nsupposed to characterize mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * it would seem, however, that dr. hart accepts this theory\\r\\n     as 8 methodological precept. see his contribution to\\r\\n     \"subconscious phenomena\" (quoted above), especially pp. 121-2.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, it is true, one objection which might be felt, not indeed to\\r\\nthe action of matter on mind, but to the action of mind on matter. the\\r\\nlaws of physics, it may be urged, are apparently adequate to explain\\r\\neverything that happens to matter, even when it is matter in a man\\'s\\r\\nbrain. this, however, is only a hypothesis, not an established theory.\\r\\nthere is no cogent empirical reason for supposing that the laws\\r\\ndetermining the motions of living bodies are exactly the same as those\\r\\nthat apply to dead matter. sometimes, of course, they are clearly the\\r\\nsame. when a man falls from a precipice or slips on a piece of orange\\r\\npeel, his body behaves as if it were devoid of life. these are the\\r\\noccasions that make bergson laugh. but when a man\\'s bodily movements\\r\\nare what we call \"voluntary,\" they are, at any rate prima facie, very\\r\\ndifferent in their laws from the movements of what is devoid of life.\\r\\ni do not wish to say dogmatically that the difference is irreducible;\\r\\ni think it highly probable that it is not. i say only that the study of\\r\\nthe behaviour of living bodies, in the present state of our knowledge,\\r\\nis distinct from physics. the study of gases was originally quite\\r\\ndistinct from that of rigid bodies, and would never have advanced to its\\r\\npresent state if it had not been independently pursued. nowadays both\\r\\nthe gas and the rigid body are manufactured out of a more primitive and\\r\\nuniversal kind of matter. in like manner, as a question of methodology,\\r\\nthe laws of living bodies are to be studied, in the first place, without\\r\\nany undue haste to subordinate them to the laws of physics. boyle\\'s law\\r\\nand the rest had to be discovered before the kinetic theory of gases\\r\\nbecame possible. but in psychology we are hardly yet at the stage\\r\\nof boyle\\'s law. meanwhile we need not be held up by the bogey of\\r\\nthe universal rigid exactness of physics. this is, as yet, a mere\\r\\nhypothesis, to be tested empirically without any preconceptions. it may\\r\\nbe true, or it may not. so far, that is all we can say.\\r\\n\\r\\nreturning from this digression to our main topic, namely, the criticism\\r\\nof \"consciousness,\" we observe that freud and his followers, though they\\r\\nhave demonstrated beyond dispute the immense importance of \"unconscious\"\\r\\ndesires in determining our actions and beliefs, have not attempted the\\r\\ntask of telling us what an \"unconscious\" desire actually is, and have\\r\\nthus invested their doctrine with an air of mystery and mythology which\\r\\nforms a large part of its popular attractiveness. they speak always as\\r\\nthough it were more normal for a desire to be conscious, and as though\\r\\na positive cause had to be assigned for its being unconscious. thus\\r\\n\"the unconscious\" becomes a sort of underground prisoner, living in a\\r\\ndungeon, breaking in at long intervals upon our daylight respectability\\r\\nwith dark groans and maledictions and strange atavistic lusts. the\\r\\nordinary reader, almost inevitably, thinks of this underground person as\\r\\nanother consciousness, prevented by what freud calls the \"censor\" from\\r\\nmaking his voice heard in company, except on rare and dreadful occasions\\r\\nwhen he shouts so loud that every one hears him and there is a scandal.\\r\\nmost of us like the idea that we could be desperately wicked if only we\\r\\nlet ourselves go. for this reason, the freudian \"unconscious\" has been a\\r\\nconsolation to many quiet and well-behaved persons.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not think the truth is quite so picturesque as this. i believe an\\r\\n\"unconscious\" desire is merely a causal law of our behaviour,* namely,\\r\\nthat we remain restlessly active until a certain state of affairs is\\r\\nrealized, when we achieve temporary equilibrium if we know beforehand\\r\\nwhat this state of affairs is, our desire is conscious; if not,\\r\\nunconscious. the unconscious desire is not something actually existing,\\r\\nbut merely a tendency to a certain behaviour; it has exactly the same\\r\\nstatus as a force in dynamics. the unconscious desire is in no way\\r\\nmysterious; it is the natural primitive form of desire, from which the\\r\\nother has developed through our habit of observing and theorizing (often\\r\\nwrongly). it is not necessary to suppose, as freud seems to do,\\r\\nthat every unconscious wish was once conscious, and was then, in his\\r\\nterminology, \"repressed\" because we disapproved of it. on the contrary,\\r\\nwe shall suppose that, although freudian \"repression\" undoubtedly occurs\\r\\nand is important, it is not the usual reason for unconsciousness of our\\r\\nwishes. the usual reason is merely that wishes are all, to begin with,\\r\\nunconscious, and only become known when they are actively noticed.\\r\\nusually, from laziness, people do not notice, but accept the theory\\r\\nof human nature which they find current, and attribute to themselves\\r\\nwhatever wishes this theory would lead them to expect. we used to be\\r\\nfull of virtuous wishes, but since freud our wishes have become, in\\r\\nthe words of the prophet jeremiah, \"deceitful above all things and\\r\\ndesperately wicked.\" both these views, in most of those who have held\\r\\nthem, are the product of theory rather than observation, for observation\\r\\nrequires effort, whereas repeating phrases does not.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. hart, \"the psychology of insanity,\" p. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe interpretation of unconscious wishes which i have been advocating\\r\\nhas been set forth briefly by professor john b. watson in an article\\r\\ncalled \"the psychology of wish fulfilment,\" which appeared in \"the\\r\\nscientific monthly\" in november, 1916. two quotations will serve to show\\r\\nhis point of view:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the freudians (he says) have made more or less of a \\'metaphysical\\r\\nentity\\' out of the censor. they suppose that when wishes are repressed\\r\\nthey are repressed into the \\'unconscious,\\' and that this mysterious\\r\\ncensor stands at the trapdoor lying between the conscious and the\\r\\nunconscious. many of us do not believe in a world of the unconscious\\r\\n(a few of us even have grave doubts about the usefulness of the term\\r\\nconsciousness), hence we try to explain censorship along ordinary\\r\\nbiological lines. we believe that one group of habits can \\'down\\' another\\r\\ngroup of habits--or instincts. in this case our ordinary system of\\r\\nhabits--those which we call expressive of our \\'real selves\\'--inhibit\\r\\nor quench (keep inactive or partially inactive) those habits and\\r\\ninstinctive tendencies which belong largely in the past\"(p. 483).\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, after speaking of the frustration of some impulses which is\\r\\ninvolved in acquiring the habits of a civilized adult, he continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"it is among these frustrated impulses that i would find the biological\\r\\nbasis of the unfulfilled wish. such \\'wishes\\' need never have been\\r\\n\\'conscious,\\' and need never have been suppressed into freud\\'s realm\\r\\nof the unconscious. it may be inferred from this that there is no\\r\\nparticular reason for applying the term \\'wish\\' to such tendencies\"(p.\\r\\n485).\\r\\n\\r\\none of the merits of the general analysis of mind which we shall\\r\\nbe concerned with in the following lectures is that it removes the\\r\\natmosphere of mystery from the phenomena brought to light by the\\r\\npsycho-analysts. mystery is delightful, but unscientific, since it\\r\\ndepends upon ignorance. man has developed out of the animals, and\\r\\nthere is no serious gap between him and the amoeba. something closely\\r\\nanalogous to knowledge and desire, as regards its effects on behaviour,\\r\\nexists among animals, even where what we call \"consciousness\" is hard\\r\\nto believe in; something equally analogous exists in ourselves in cases\\r\\nwhere no trace of \"consciousness\" can be found. it is therefore\\r\\nnatural to suppose that, what ever may be the correct definition of\\r\\n\"consciousness,\" \"consciousness\" is not the essence of life or mind. in\\r\\nthe following lectures, accordingly, this term will disappear until we\\r\\nhave dealt with words, when it will re-emerge as mainly a trivial and\\r\\nunimportant outcome of linguistic habits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture ii. instinct and habit\\r\\n\\r\\nin attempting to understand the elements out of which mental phenomena\\r\\nare compounded, it is of the greatest importance to remember that from\\r\\nthe protozoa to man there is nowhere a very wide gap either in structure\\r\\nor in behaviour. from this fact it is a highly probable inference that\\r\\nthere is also nowhere a very wide mental gap. it is, of course, possible\\r\\nthat there may be, at certain stages in evolution, elements which are\\r\\nentirely new from the standpoint of analysis, though in their nascent\\r\\nform they have little influence on behaviour and no very marked\\r\\ncorrelatives in structure. but the hypothesis of continuity in mental\\r\\ndevelopment is clearly preferable if no psychological facts make it\\r\\nimpossible. we shall find, if i am not mistaken, that there are no facts\\r\\nwhich refute the hypothesis of mental continuity, and that, on the other\\r\\nhand, this hypothesis affords a useful test of suggested theories as to\\r\\nthe nature of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hypothesis of mental continuity throughout organic evolution may be\\r\\nused in two different ways. on the one hand, it may be held that we\\r\\nhave more knowledge of our own minds than those of animals, and that we\\r\\nshould use this knowledge to infer the existence of something similar\\r\\nto our own mental processes in animals and even in plants. on the other\\r\\nhand, it may be held that animals and plants present simpler phenomena,\\r\\nmore easily analysed than those of human minds; on this ground it may be\\r\\nurged that explanations which are adequate in the case of animals ought\\r\\nnot to be lightly rejected in the case of man. the practical effects of\\r\\nthese two views are diametrically opposite: the first leads us to level\\r\\nup animal intelligence with what we believe ourselves to know about our\\r\\nown intelligence, while the second leads us to attempt a levelling down\\r\\nof our own intelligence to something not too remote from what we can\\r\\nobserve in animals. it is therefore important to consider the relative\\r\\njustification of the two ways of applying the principle of continuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is clear that the question turns upon another, namely, which can we\\r\\nknow best, the psychology of animals or that of human beings? if we\\r\\ncan know most about animals, we shall use this knowledge as a basis for\\r\\ninference about human beings; if we can know most about human beings, we\\r\\nshall adopt the opposite procedure. and the question whether we can know\\r\\nmost about the psychology of human beings or about that of animals turns\\r\\nupon yet another, namely: is introspection or external observation\\r\\nthe surer method in psychology? this is a question which i propose to\\r\\ndiscuss at length in lecture vi; i shall therefore content myself now\\r\\nwith a statement of the conclusions to be arrived at.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe know a great many things concerning ourselves which we cannot know\\r\\nnearly so directly concerning animals or even other people. we know when\\r\\nwe have a toothache, what we are thinking of, what dreams we have when\\r\\nwe are asleep, and a host of other occurrences which we only know about\\r\\nothers when they tell us of them, or otherwise make them inferable\\r\\nby their behaviour. thus, so far as knowledge of detached facts is\\r\\nconcerned, the advantage is on the side of self-knowledge as against\\r\\nexternal observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut when we come to the analysis and scientific understanding of the\\r\\nfacts, the advantages on the side of self-knowledge become far less\\r\\nclear. we know, for example, that we have desires and beliefs, but we\\r\\ndo not know what constitutes a desire or a belief. the phenomena are so\\r\\nfamiliar that it is difficult to realize how little we really know about\\r\\nthem. we see in animals, and to a lesser extent in plants, behaviour\\r\\nmore or less similar to that which, in us, is prompted by desires and\\r\\nbeliefs, and we find that, as we descend in the scale of evolution,\\r\\nbehaviour becomes simpler, more easily reducible to rule, more\\r\\nscientifically analysable and predictable. and just because we are not\\r\\nmisled by familiarity we find it easier to be cautious in interpreting\\r\\nbehaviour when we are dealing with phenomena remote from those of our\\r\\nown minds: moreover, introspection, as psychoanalysis has demonstrated,\\r\\nis extraordinarily fallible even in cases where we feel a high degree of\\r\\ncertainty. the net result seems to be that, though self-knowledge has\\r\\na definite and important contribution to make to psychology, it is\\r\\nexceedingly misleading unless it is constantly checked and controlled\\r\\nby the test of external observation, and by the theories which such\\r\\nobservation suggests when applied to animal behaviour. on the whole,\\r\\ntherefore, there is probably more to be learnt about human psychology\\r\\nfrom animals than about animal psychology from human beings; but this\\r\\nconclusion is one of degree, and must not be pressed beyond a point.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is only bodily phenomena that can be directly observed in animals,\\r\\nor even, strictly speaking, in other human beings. we can observe such\\r\\nthings as their movements, their physiological processes, and the sounds\\r\\nthey emit. such things as desires and beliefs, which seem obvious\\r\\nto introspection, are not visible directly to external observation.\\r\\naccordingly, if we begin our study of psychology by external\\r\\nobservation, we must not begin by assuming such things as desires and\\r\\nbeliefs, but only such things as external observation can reveal, which\\r\\nwill be characteristics of the movements and physiological processes of\\r\\nanimals. some animals, for example, always run away from light and hide\\r\\nthemselves in dark places. if you pick up a mossy stone which is lightly\\r\\nembedded in the earth, you will see a number of small animals scuttling\\r\\naway from the unwonted daylight and seeking again the darkness of which\\r\\nyou have deprived them. such animals are sensitive to light, in the\\r\\nsense that their movements are affected by it; but it would be rash to\\r\\ninfer that they have sensations in any way analogous to our sensations\\r\\nof sight. such inferences, which go beyond the observable facts, are to\\r\\nbe avoided with the utmost care.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is customary to divide human movements into three classes, voluntary,\\r\\nreflex and mechanical. we may illustrate the distinction by a quotation\\r\\nfrom william james (\"psychology,\" i, 12):\\r\\n\\r\\n\"if i hear the conductor calling \\'all aboard\\' as i enter the depot, my\\r\\nheart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs respond to the air-waves\\r\\nfalling on my tympanum by quickening their movements. if i stumble as i\\r\\nrun, the sensation of falling provokes a movement of the hands towards\\r\\nthe direction of the fall, the effect of which is to shield the body\\r\\nfrom too sudden a shock. if a cinder enter my eye, its lids close\\r\\nforcibly and a copious flow of tears tends to wash it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"these three responses to a sensational stimulus differ, however, in\\r\\nmany respects. the closure of the eye and the lachrymation are quite\\r\\ninvoluntary, and so is the disturbance of the heart. such involuntary\\r\\nresponses we know as \\'reflex\\' acts. the motion of the arms to break the\\r\\nshock of falling may also be called reflex, since it occurs too quickly\\r\\nto be deliberately intended. whether it be instinctive or whether it\\r\\nresult from the pedestrian education of childhood may be doubtful; it\\r\\nis, at any rate, less automatic than the previous acts, for a man might\\r\\nby conscious effort learn to perform it more skilfully, or even to\\r\\nsuppress it altogether. actions of this kind, with which instinct and\\r\\nvolition enter upon equal terms, have been called \\'semi-reflex.\\' the\\r\\nact of running towards the train, on the other hand, has no instinctive\\r\\nelement about it. it is purely the result of education, and is preceded\\r\\nby a consciousness of the purpose to be attained and a distinct mandate\\r\\nof the will. it is a \\'voluntary act.\\' thus the animal\\'s reflex and\\r\\nvoluntary performances shade into each other gradually, being connected\\r\\nby acts which may often occur automatically, but may also be modified by\\r\\nconscious intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"an outside observer, unable to perceive the accompanying consciousness,\\r\\nmight be wholly at a loss to discriminate between the automatic acts and\\r\\nthose which volition escorted. but if the criterion of mind\\'s existence\\r\\nbe the choice of the proper means for the attainment of a supposed\\r\\nend, all the acts alike seem to be inspired by intelligence, for\\r\\nappropriateness characterizes them all alike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is one movement, among those that james mentions at first, which\\r\\nis not subsequently classified, namely, the stumbling. this is the\\r\\nkind of movement which may be called \"mechanical\"; it is evidently of a\\r\\ndifferent kind from either reflex or voluntary movements, and more akin\\r\\nto the movements of dead matter. we may define a movement of an animal\\'s\\r\\nbody as \"mechanical\" when it proceeds as if only dead matter were\\r\\ninvolved. for example, if you fall over a cliff, you move under the\\r\\ninfluence of gravitation, and your centre of gravity describes just as\\r\\ncorrect a parabola as if you were already dead. mechanical movements\\r\\nhave not the characteristic of appropriateness, unless by accident, as\\r\\nwhen a drunken man falls into a waterbutt and is sobered. but reflex\\r\\nand voluntary movements are not always appropriate, unless in some very\\r\\nrecondite sense. a moth flying into a lamp is not acting sensibly; no\\r\\nmore is a man who is in such a hurry to get his ticket that he cannot\\r\\nremember the name of his destination. appropriateness is a complicated\\r\\nand merely approximate idea, and for the present we shall do well to\\r\\ndismiss it from our thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nas james states, there is no difference, from the point of view of\\r\\nthe outside observer, between voluntary and reflex movements. the\\r\\nphysiologist can discover that both depend upon the nervous system,\\r\\nand he may find that the movements which we call voluntary depend upon\\r\\nhigher centres in the brain than those that are reflex. but he\\r\\ncannot discover anything as to the presence or absence of \"will\" or\\r\\n\"consciousness,\" for these things can only be seen from within, if\\r\\nat all. for the present, we wish to place ourselves resolutely in the\\r\\nposition of outside observers; we will therefore ignore the distinction\\r\\nbetween voluntary and reflex movements. we will call the two together\\r\\n\"vital\" movements. we may then distinguish \"vital\" from mechanical\\r\\nmovements by the fact that vital movements depend for their causation\\r\\nupon the special properties of the nervous system, while mechanical\\r\\nmovements depend only upon the properties which animal bodies share with\\r\\nmatter in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is need for some care if the distinction between mechanical and\\r\\nvital movements is to be made precise. it is quite likely that, if we\\r\\nknew more about animal bodies, we could deduce all their movements from\\r\\nthe laws of chemistry and physics. it is already fairly easy to see how\\r\\nchemistry reduces to physics, i.e. how the differences between different\\r\\nchemical elements can be accounted for by differences of physical\\r\\nstructure, the constituents of the structure being electrons which are\\r\\nexactly alike in all kinds of matter. we only know in part how to reduce\\r\\nphysiology to chemistry, but we know enough to make it likely that the\\r\\nreduction is possible. if we suppose it effected, what would become of\\r\\nthe difference between vital and mechanical movements?\\r\\n\\r\\nsome analogies will make the difference clear. a shock to a mass of\\r\\ndynamite produces quite different effects from an equal shock to a mass\\r\\nof steel: in the one case there is a vast explosion, while in the other\\r\\ncase there is hardly any noticeable disturbance. similarly, you may\\r\\nsometimes find on a mountain-side a large rock poised so delicately that\\r\\na touch will set it crashing down into the valley, while the rocks all\\r\\nround are so firm that only a considerable force can dislodge them what\\r\\nis analogous in these two cases is the existence of a great store of\\r\\nenergy in unstable equilibrium ready to burst into violent motion by\\r\\nthe addition of a very slight disturbance. similarly, it requires only\\r\\na very slight expenditure of energy to send a post-card with the words\\r\\n\"all is discovered; fly!\" but the effect in generating kinetic energy\\r\\nis said to be amazing. a human body, like a mass of dynamite, contains\\r\\na store of energy in unstable equilibrium, ready to be directed in this\\r\\ndirection or that by a disturbance which is physically very small,\\r\\nsuch as a spoken word. in all such cases the reduction of behaviour to\\r\\nphysical laws can only be effected by entering into great minuteness; so\\r\\nlong as we confine ourselves to the observation of comparatively\\r\\nlarge masses, the way in which the equilibrium will be upset cannot be\\r\\ndetermined. physicists distinguish between macroscopic and microscopic\\r\\nequations: the former determine the visible movements of bodies of\\r\\nordinary size, the latter the minute occurrences in the smallest parts.\\r\\nit is only the microscopic equations that are supposed to be the same\\r\\nfor all sorts of matter. the macroscopic equations result from a process\\r\\nof averaging out, and may be different in different cases. so, in our\\r\\ninstance, the laws of macroscopic phenomena are different for mechanical\\r\\nand vital movements, though the laws of microscopic phenomena may be the\\r\\nsame.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may say, speaking somewhat roughly, that a stimulus applied to the\\r\\nnervous system, like a spark to dynamite, is able to take advantage of\\r\\nthe stored energy in unstable equilibrium, and thus to produce movements\\r\\nout of proportion to the proximate cause. movements produced in this way\\r\\nare vital movements, while mechanical movements are those in which the\\r\\nstored energy of a living body is not involved. similarly dynamite may\\r\\nbe exploded, thereby displaying its characteristic properties, or may\\r\\n(with due precautions) be carted about like any other mineral. the\\r\\nexplosion is analogous to vital movements, the carting about to\\r\\nmechanical movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nmechanical movements are of no interest to the psychologist, and it has\\r\\nonly been necessary to define them in order to be able to exclude them.\\r\\nwhen a psychologist studies behaviour, it is only vital movements\\r\\nthat concern him. we shall, therefore, proceed to ignore mechanical\\r\\nmovements, and study only the properties of the remainder.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next point is to distinguish between movements that are instinctive\\r\\nand movements that are acquired by experience. this distinction also is\\r\\nto some extent one of degree. professor lloyd morgan gives the following\\r\\ndefinition of \"instinctive behaviour\":\\r\\n\\r\\n\"that which is, on its first occurrence, independent of prior\\r\\nexperience; which tends to the well-being of the individual and the\\r\\npreservation of the race; which is similarly performed by all members\\r\\nof the same more or less restricted group of animals; and which may be\\r\\nsubject to subsequent modification under the guidance of experience.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"instinct and experience\" (methuen, 1912) p. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis definition is framed for the purposes of biology, and is in\\r\\nsome respects unsuited to the needs of psychology. though perhaps\\r\\nunavoidable, allusion to \"the same more or less restricted group\\r\\nof animals\" makes it impossible to judge what is instinctive in the\\r\\nbehaviour of an isolated individual. moreover, \"the well-being of\\r\\nthe individual and the preservation of the race\" is only a usual\\r\\ncharacteristic, not a universal one, of the sort of movements that, from\\r\\nour point of view, are to be called instinctive; instances of harmful\\r\\ninstincts will be given shortly. the essential point of the definition,\\r\\nfrom our point of view, is that an instinctive movement is in dependent\\r\\nof prior experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may say that an \"instinctive\" movement is a vital movement performed\\r\\nby an animal the first time that it finds itself in a novel situation;\\r\\nor, more correctly, one which it would perform if the situation were\\r\\nnovel.* the instincts of an animal are different at different periods of\\r\\nits growth, and this fact may cause changes of behaviour which are\\r\\nnot due to learning. the maturing and seasonal fluctuation of the\\r\\nsex-instinct affords a good illustration. when the sex-instinct first\\r\\nmatures, the behaviour of an animal in the presence of a mate is\\r\\ndifferent from its previous behaviour in similar circumstances, but is\\r\\nnot learnt, since it is just the same if the animal has never previously\\r\\nbeen in the presence of a mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * though this can only be decided by comparison with other\\r\\n     members of the species, and thus exposes us to the need of\\r\\n     comparison which we thought an objection to professor lloyd\\r\\n     morgan\\'s definition.\\r\\n\\r\\non the other hand, a movement is \"learnt,\" or embodies a \"habit,\" if it\\r\\nis due to previous experience of similar situations, and is not what it\\r\\nwould be if the animal had had no such experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are various complications which blur the sharpness of this\\r\\ndistinction in practice. to begin with, many instincts mature gradually,\\r\\nand while they are immature an animal may act in a fumbling manner which\\r\\nis very difficult to distinguish from learning. james (\"psychology,\" ii,\\r\\n407) maintains that children walk by instinct, and that the awkwardness\\r\\nof their first attempts is only due to the fact that the instinct has\\r\\nnot yet ripened. he hopes that \"some scientific widower, left alone with\\r\\nhis offspring at the critical moment, may ere long test this suggestion\\r\\non the living subject.\" however this may be, he quotes evidence to show\\r\\nthat \"birds do not learn to fly,\" but fly by instinct when they reach\\r\\nthe appropriate age (ib., p. 406). in the second place, instinct often\\r\\ngives only a rough outline of the sort of thing to do, in which case\\r\\nlearning is necessary in order to acquire certainty and precision in\\r\\naction. in the third place, even in the clearest cases of acquired\\r\\nhabit, such as speaking, some instinct is required to set in motion\\r\\nthe process of learning. in the case of speaking, the chief instinct\\r\\ninvolved is commonly supposed to be that of imitation, but this may be\\r\\nquestioned. (see thorndike\\'s \"animal intelligence,\" p. 253 ff.)\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite of these qualifications, the broad distinction between instinct\\r\\nand habit is undeniable. to take extreme cases, every animal at birth\\r\\ncan take food by instinct, before it has had opportunity to learn; on\\r\\nthe other hand, no one can ride a bicycle by instinct, though, after\\r\\nlearning, the necessary movements become just as automatic as if they\\r\\nwere instinctive.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe process of learning, which consists in the acquisition of habits,\\r\\nhas been much studied in various animals.* for example: you put a hungry\\r\\nanimal, say a cat, in a cage which has a door that can be opened by\\r\\nlifting a latch; outside the cage you put food. the cat at first dashes\\r\\nall round the cage, making frantic efforts to force a way out. at last,\\r\\nby accident, the latch is lifted and the cat pounces on the food. next\\r\\nday you repeat the experiment, and you find that the cat gets out much\\r\\nmore quickly than the first time, although it still makes some random\\r\\nmovements. the third day it gets out still more quickly, and before long\\r\\nit goes straight to the latch and lifts it at once. or you make a model\\r\\nof the hampton court maze, and put a rat in the middle, assaulted by the\\r\\nsmell of food on the outside. the rat starts running down the passages,\\r\\nand is constantly stopped by blind alleys, but at last, by persistent\\r\\nattempts, it gets out. you repeat this experiment day after day; you\\r\\nmeasure the time taken by the rat in reaching the food; you find that\\r\\nthe time rapidly diminishes, and that after a while the rat ceases to\\r\\nmake any wrong turnings. it is by essentially similar processes that we\\r\\nlearn speaking, writing, mathematics, or the government of an empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * the scientific study of this subject may almost be said to\\r\\n     begin with thorndike\\'s \"animal intelligence\" (macmillan,\\r\\n     1911).\\r\\n\\r\\nprofessor watson (\"behavior,\" pp. 262-3) has an ingenious theory as to\\r\\nthe way in which habit arises out of random movements. i think there is\\r\\na reason why his theory cannot be regarded as alone sufficient, but it\\r\\nseems not unlikely that it is partly correct. suppose, for the sake of\\r\\nsimplicity, that there are just ten random movements which may be made\\r\\nby the animal--say, ten paths down which it may go--and that only one of\\r\\nthese leads to food, or whatever else represents success in the case in\\r\\nquestion. then the successful movement always occurs during the animal\\'s\\r\\nattempts, whereas each of the others, on the average, occurs in only\\r\\nhalf the attempts. thus the tendency to repeat a previous performance\\r\\n(which is easily explicable without the intervention of \"consciousness\")\\r\\nleads to a greater emphasis on the successful movement than on any\\r\\nother, and in time causes it alone to be performed. the objection to\\r\\nthis view, if taken as the sole explanation, is that on improvement\\r\\nought to set in till after the second trial, whereas experiment shows\\r\\nthat already at the second attempt the animal does better than the\\r\\nfirst time. something further is, therefore, required to account for the\\r\\ngenesis of habit from random movements; but i see no reason to suppose\\r\\nthat what is further required involves \"consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmr. thorndike (op. cit., p. 244) formulates two \"provisional laws of\\r\\nacquired behaviour or learning,\" as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the law of effect is that: of several responses made to the same\\r\\nsituation, those which are accompanied or closely followed by\\r\\nsatisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more\\r\\nfirmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will\\r\\nbe more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed\\r\\nby discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their\\r\\nconnections with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs,\\r\\nthey will be less likely to occur. the greater the satisfaction or\\r\\ndiscomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the law of exercise is that: any response to a situation will, other\\r\\nthings being equal, be more strongly connected with the situation\\r\\nin proportion to the number of times it has been connected with that\\r\\nsituation and to the average vigour and duration of the connections.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwith the explanation to be presently given of the meaning of\\r\\n\"satisfaction\" and \"discomfort,\" there seems every reason to accept\\r\\nthese two laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat is true of animals, as regards instinct and habit, is equally\\r\\ntrue of men. but the higher we rise in the evolutionary scale, broadly\\r\\nspeaking, the greater becomes the power of learning, and the fewer are\\r\\nthe occasions when pure instinct is exhibited unmodified in adult life.\\r\\nthis applies with great force to man, so much so that some have thought\\r\\ninstinct less important in the life of man than in that of animals.\\r\\nthis, however, would be a mistake. learning is only possible when\\r\\ninstinct supplies the driving-force. the animals in cages, which\\r\\ngradually learn to get out, perform random movements at first, which\\r\\nare purely instinctive. but for these random movements, they would never\\r\\nacquire the experience which afterwards enables them to produce the\\r\\nright movement. (this is partly questioned by hobhouse*--wrongly, i\\r\\nthink.) similarly, children learning to talk make all sorts of sounds,\\r\\nuntil one day the right sound comes by accident. it is clear that the\\r\\noriginal making of random sounds, without which speech would never be\\r\\nlearnt, is instinctive. i think we may say the same of all the habits\\r\\nand aptitudes that we acquire in all of them there has been present\\r\\nthroughout some instinctive activity, prompting at first rather\\r\\ninefficient movements, but supplying the driving force while more and\\r\\nmore effective methods are being acquired. a cat which is hungry smells\\r\\nfish, and goes to the larder. this is a thoroughly efficient method when\\r\\nthere is fish in the larder, and it is often successfully practised by\\r\\nchildren. but in later life it is found that merely going to the larder\\r\\ndoes not cause fish to be there; after a series of random movements it\\r\\nis found that this result is to be caused by going to the city in the\\r\\nmorning and coming back in the evening. no one would have guessed a\\r\\npriori that this movement of a middle-aged man\\'s body would cause fish\\r\\nto come out of the sea into his larder, but experience shows that it\\r\\ndoes, and the middle-aged man therefore continues to go to the city,\\r\\njust as the cat in the cage continues to lift the latch when it has once\\r\\nfound it. of course, in actual fact, human learning is rendered easier,\\r\\nthough psychologically more complex, through language; but at bottom\\r\\nlanguage does not alter the essential character of learning, or of the\\r\\npart played by instinct in promoting learning. language, however, is a\\r\\nsubject upon which i do not wish to speak until a later lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"mind in evolution\" (macmillan, 1915), pp. 236-237.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe popular conception of instinct errs by imagining it to be infallible\\r\\nand preternaturally wise, as well as incapable of modification. this is\\r\\na complete delusion. instinct, as a rule, is very rough and ready, able\\r\\nto achieve its result under ordinary circumstances, but easily misled by\\r\\nanything unusual. chicks follow their mother by instinct, but when they\\r\\nare quite young they will follow with equal readiness any moving\\r\\nobject remotely resembling their mother, or even a human being (james,\\r\\n\"psychology,\" ii, 396). bergson, quoting fabre, has made play with the\\r\\nsupposed extraordinary accuracy of the solitary wasp ammophila, which\\r\\nlays its eggs in a caterpillar. on this subject i will quote from\\r\\ndrever\\'s \"instinct in man,\" p. 92:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"according to fabre\\'s observations, which bergson accepts, the ammophila\\r\\nstings its prey exactly and unerringly in each of the nervous centres.\\r\\nthe result is that the caterpillar is paralyzed, but not immediately\\r\\nkilled, the advantage of this being that the larva cannot be injured by\\r\\nany movement of the caterpillar, upon which the egg is deposited, and is\\r\\nprovided with fresh meat when the time comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"now dr. and mrs. peckham have shown that the sting of the wasp is not\\r\\nunerring, as fabre alleges, that the number of stings is not constant,\\r\\nthat sometimes the caterpillar is not paralyzed, and sometimes it is\\r\\nkilled outright, and that the different circumstances do not apparently\\r\\nmake any difference to the larva, which is not injured by slight\\r\\nmovements of the caterpillar, nor by consuming food decomposed rather\\r\\nthan fresh caterpillar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis illustrates how love of the marvellous may mislead even so careful\\r\\nan observer as fabre and so eminent a philosopher as bergson.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the same chapter of dr. drever\\'s book there are some interesting\\r\\nexamples of the mistakes made by instinct. i will quote one as a sample:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the larva of the lomechusa beetle eats the young of the ants, in whose\\r\\nnest it is reared. nevertheless, the ants tend the lomechusa larvae\\r\\nwith the same care they bestow on their own young. not only so, but they\\r\\napparently discover that the methods of feeding, which suit their own\\r\\nlarvae, would prove fatal to the guests, and accordingly they change\\r\\ntheir whole system of nursing\" (loc. cit., p. 106).\\r\\n\\r\\nsemon (\"die mneme,\" pp. 207-9) gives a good illustration of an instinct\\r\\ngrowing wiser through experience. he relates how hunters attract stags\\r\\nby imitating the sounds of other members of their species, male or\\r\\nfemale, but find that the older a stag becomes the more difficult it\\r\\nis to deceive him, and the more accurate the imitation has to be. the\\r\\nliterature of instinct is vast, and illustrations might be multiplied\\r\\nindefinitely. the main points as regards instinct, which need to be\\r\\nemphasized as against the popular conceptions of it, are:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) that instinct requires no prevision of the biological end which it\\r\\nserves;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) that instinct is only adapted to achieve this end in the usual\\r\\ncircumstances of the animal in question, and has no more precision than\\r\\nis necessary for success as a rule;\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) that processes initiated by instinct often come to be performed\\r\\nbetter after experience;\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) that instinct supplies the impulses to experimental movements which\\r\\nare required for the process of learning;\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) that instincts in their nascent stages are easily modifiable, and\\r\\ncapable of being attached to various sorts of objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nall the above characteristics of instinct can be established by purely\\r\\nexternal observation, except the fact that instinct does not require\\r\\nprevision. this, though not strictly capable of being proved by\\r\\nobservation, is irresistibly suggested by the most obvious phenomena.\\r\\nwho can believe, for example, that a new-born baby is aware of the\\r\\nnecessity of food for preserving life? or that insects, in laying eggs,\\r\\nare concerned for the preservation of their species? the essence of\\r\\ninstinct, one might say, is that it provides a mechanism for\\r\\nacting without foresight in a manner which is usually advantageous\\r\\nbiologically. it is partly for this reason that it is so important to\\r\\nunderstand the fundamental position of instinct in prompting both animal\\r\\nand human behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture iii. desire and feeling\\r\\n\\r\\ndesire is a subject upon which, if i am not mistaken, true views can\\r\\nonly be arrived at by an almost complete reversal of the ordinary\\r\\nunreflecting opinion. it is natural to regard desire as in its essence\\r\\nan attitude towards something which is imagined, not actual; this\\r\\nsomething is called the end or object of the desire, and is said to be\\r\\nthe purpose of any action resulting from the desire. we think of the\\r\\ncontent of the desire as being just like the content of a belief, while\\r\\nthe attitude taken up towards the content is different. according to\\r\\nthis theory, when we say: \"i hope it will rain,\" or \"i expect it will\\r\\nrain,\" we express, in the first case, a desire, and in the second, a\\r\\nbelief, with an identical content, namely, the image of rain. it would\\r\\nbe easy to say that, just as belief is one kind of feeling in relation\\r\\nto this content, so desire is another kind. according to this view, what\\r\\ncomes first in desire is something imagined, with a specific feeling\\r\\nrelated to it, namely, that specific feeling which we call \"desiring\"\\r\\nit. the discomfort associated with unsatisfied desire, and the actions\\r\\nwhich aim at satisfying desire, are, in this view, both of them effects\\r\\nof the desire. i think it is fair to say that this is a view against\\r\\nwhich common sense would not rebel; nevertheless, i believe it to be\\r\\nradically mistaken. it cannot be refuted logically, but various facts\\r\\ncan be adduced which make it gradually less simple and plausible, until\\r\\nat last it turns out to be easier to abandon it wholly and look at the\\r\\nmatter in a totally different way.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first set of facts to be adduced against the common sense view of\\r\\ndesire are those studied by psycho-analysis. in all human beings, but\\r\\nmost markedly in those suffering from hysteria and certain forms of\\r\\ninsanity, we find what are called \"unconscious\" desires, which are\\r\\ncommonly regarded as showing self-deception. most psycho-analysts\\r\\npay little attention to the analysis of desire, being interested in\\r\\ndiscovering by observation what it is that people desire, rather than in\\r\\ndiscovering what actually constitutes desire. i think the strangeness of\\r\\nwhat they report would be greatly diminished if it were expressed in the\\r\\nlanguage of a behaviourist theory of desire, rather than in the language\\r\\nof every-day beliefs. the general description of the sort of phenomena\\r\\nthat bear on our present question is as follows: a person states that\\r\\nhis desires are so-and-so, and that it is these desires that inspire his\\r\\nactions; but the outside observer perceives that his actions are such\\r\\nas to realize quite different ends from those which he avows, and\\r\\nthat these different ends are such as he might be expected to desire.\\r\\ngenerally they are less virtuous than his professed desires, and are\\r\\ntherefore less agreeable to profess than these are. it is accordingly\\r\\nsupposed that they really exist as desires for ends, but in a\\r\\nsubconscious part of the mind, which the patient refuses to admit into\\r\\nconsciousness for fear of having to think ill of himself. there are\\r\\nno doubt many cases to which such a supposition is applicable without\\r\\nobvious artificiality. but the deeper the freudians delve into the\\r\\nunderground regions of instinct, the further they travel from anything\\r\\nresembling conscious desire, and the less possible it becomes to believe\\r\\nthat only positive self-deception conceals from us that we really wish\\r\\nfor things which are abhorrent to our explicit life.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the cases in question we have a conflict between the outside observer\\r\\nand the patient\\'s consciousness. the whole tendency of psycho-analysis\\r\\nis to trust the outside observer rather than the testimony of\\r\\nintrospection. i believe this tendency to be entirely right, but to\\r\\ndemand a re-statement of what constitutes desire, exhibiting it as a\\r\\ncausal law of our actions, not as something actually existing in our\\r\\nminds.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut let us first get a clearer statement of the essential characteristic\\r\\nof the phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\na person, we find, states that he desires a certain end a, and that he\\r\\nis acting with a view to achieving it. we observe, however, that his\\r\\nactions are such as are likely to achieve a quite different end b, and\\r\\nthat b is the sort of end that often seems to be aimed at by animals and\\r\\nsavages, though civilized people are supposed to have discarded it. we\\r\\nsometimes find also a whole set of false beliefs, of such a kind as to\\r\\npersuade the patient that his actions are really a means to a, when in\\r\\nfact they are a means to b. for example, we have an impulse to inflict\\r\\npain upon those whom we hate; we therefore believe that they are wicked,\\r\\nand that punishment will reform them. this belief enables us to act upon\\r\\nthe impulse to inflict pain, while believing that we are acting upon\\r\\nthe desire to lead sinners to repentance. it is for this reason that the\\r\\ncriminal law has been in all ages more severe than it would have been if\\r\\nthe impulse to ameliorate the criminal had been what really inspired\\r\\nit. it seems simple to explain such a state of affairs as due to\\r\\n\"self-deception,\" but this explanation is often mythical. most people,\\r\\nin thinking about punishment, have had no more need to hide their\\r\\nvindictive impulses from themselves than they have had to hide\\r\\nthe exponential theorem. our impulses are not patent to a casual\\r\\nobservation, but are only to be discovered by a scientific study of our\\r\\nactions, in the course of which we must regard ourselves as objectively\\r\\nas we should the motions of the planets or the chemical reactions of a\\r\\nnew element.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe study of animals reinforces this conclusion, and is in many ways\\r\\nthe best preparation for the analysis of desire. in animals we are\\r\\nnot troubled by the disturbing influence of ethical considerations. in\\r\\ndealing with human beings, we are perpetually distracted by being told\\r\\nthat such-and-such a view is gloomy or cynical or pessimistic: ages of\\r\\nhuman conceit have built up such a vast myth as to our wisdom and virtue\\r\\nthat any intrusion of the mere scientific desire to know the facts is\\r\\ninstantly resented by those who cling to comfortable illusions. but no\\r\\none cares whether animals are virtuous or not, and no one is under the\\r\\ndelusion that they are rational. moreover, we do not expect them to be\\r\\nso \"conscious,\" and are prepared to admit that their instincts prompt\\r\\nuseful actions without any prevision of the ends which they achieve. for\\r\\nall these reasons, there is much in the analysis of mind which is more\\r\\neasily discovered by the study of animals than by the observation of\\r\\nhuman beings.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe all think that, by watching the behaviour of animals, we can discover\\r\\nmore or less what they desire. if this is the case--and i fully agree\\r\\nthat it is--desire must be capable of being exhibited in actions, for it\\r\\nis only the actions of animals that we can observe. they may have minds\\r\\nin which all sorts of things take place, but we can know nothing about\\r\\ntheir minds except by means of inferences from their actions; and the\\r\\nmore such inferences are examined, the more dubious they appear. it\\r\\nwould seem, therefore, that actions alone must be the test of the\\r\\ndesires of animals. from this it is an easy step to the conclusion that\\r\\nan animal\\'s desire is nothing but a characteristic of a certain series\\r\\nof actions, namely, those which would be commonly regarded as inspired\\r\\nby the desire in question. and when it has been shown that this view\\r\\naffords a satisfactory account of animal desires, it is not difficult\\r\\nto see that the same explanation is applicable to the desires of human\\r\\nbeings.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe judge easily from the behaviour of an animal of a familiar\\r\\nkind whether it is hungry or thirsty, or pleased or displeased, or\\r\\ninquisitive or terrified. the verification of our judgment, so far\\r\\nas verification is possible, must be derived from the immediately\\r\\nsucceeding actions of the animal. most people would say that they infer\\r\\nfirst something about the animal\\'s state of mind--whether it is hungry\\r\\nor thirsty and so on--and thence derive their expectations as to its\\r\\nsubsequent conduct. but this detour through the animal\\'s supposed mind\\r\\nis wholly unnecessary. we can say simply: the animal\\'s behaviour during\\r\\nthe last minute has had those characteristics which distinguish what\\r\\nis called \"hunger,\" and it is likely that its actions during the next\\r\\nminute will be similar in this respect, unless it finds food, or is\\r\\ninterrupted by a stronger impulse, such as fear. an animal which is\\r\\nhungry is restless, it goes to the places where food is often to be\\r\\nfound, it sniffs with its nose or peers with its eyes or otherwise\\r\\nincreases the sensitiveness of its sense-organs; as soon as it is near\\r\\nenough to food for its sense-organs to be affected, it goes to it with\\r\\nall speed and proceeds to eat; after which, if the quantity of food has\\r\\nbeen sufficient, its whole demeanour changes it may very likely lie\\r\\ndown and go to sleep. these things and others like them are observable\\r\\nphenomena distinguishing a hungry animal from one which is not hungry.\\r\\nthe characteristic mark by which we recognize a series of actions\\r\\nwhich display hunger is not the animal\\'s mental state, which we cannot\\r\\nobserve, but something in its bodily behaviour; it is this observable\\r\\ntrait in the bodily behaviour that i am proposing to call \"hunger,\"\\r\\nnot some possibly mythical and certainly unknowable ingredient of the\\r\\nanimal\\'s mind.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeneralizing what occurs in the case of hunger, we may say that what\\r\\nwe call a desire in an animal is always displayed in a cycle of actions\\r\\nhaving certain fairly well marked characteristics. there is first a\\r\\nstate of activity, consisting, with qualifications to be mentioned\\r\\npresently, of movements likely to have a certain result; these\\r\\nmovements, unless interrupted, continue until the result is achieved,\\r\\nafter which there is usually a period of comparative quiescence. a cycle\\r\\nof actions of this sort has marks by which it is broadly distinguished\\r\\nfrom the motions of dead matter. the most notable of these marks\\r\\nare--(1) the appropriateness of the actions for the realization of a\\r\\ncertain result; (2) the continuance of action until that result has been\\r\\nachieved. neither of these can be pressed beyond a point. either may\\r\\nbe (a) to some extent present in dead matter, and (b) to a considerable\\r\\nextent absent in animals, while vegetable are intermediate, and display\\r\\nonly a much fainter form of the behaviour which leads us to attribute\\r\\ndesire to animals. (a) one might say rivers \"desire\" the sea water,\\r\\nroughly speaking, remains in restless motion until it reaches either\\r\\nthe sea or a place from which it cannot issue without going uphill, and\\r\\ntherefore we might say that this is what it wishes while it is flowing.\\r\\nwe do not say so, because we can account for the behaviour of water by\\r\\nthe laws of physics; and if we knew more about animals, we might equally\\r\\ncease to attribute desires to them, since we might find physical and\\r\\nchemical reactions sufficient to account for their behaviour. (b) many\\r\\nof the movements of animals do not exhibit the characteristics of the\\r\\ncycles which seem to embody desire. there are first of all the movements\\r\\nwhich are \"mechanical,\" such as slipping and falling, where ordinary\\r\\nphysical forces operate upon the animal\\'s body almost as if it were\\r\\ndead matter. an animal which falls over a cliff may make a number of\\r\\ndesperate struggles while it is in the air, but its centre of gravity\\r\\nwill move exactly as it would if the animal were dead. in this case, if\\r\\nthe animal is killed at the end of the fall, we have, at first sight,\\r\\njust the characteristics of a cycle of actions embodying desire, namely,\\r\\nrestless movement until the ground is reached, and then quiescence.\\r\\nnevertheless, we feel no temptation to say that the animal desired what\\r\\noccurred, partly because of the obviously mechanical nature of the whole\\r\\noccurrence, partly because, when an animal survives a fall, it tends not\\r\\nto repeat the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere may be other reasons also, but of them i do not wish to speak yet.\\r\\nbesides mechanical movements, there are interrupted movements, as when\\r\\na bird, on its way to eat your best peas, is frightened away by the boy\\r\\nwhom you are employing for that purpose. if interruptions are frequent\\r\\nand completion of cycles rare, the characteristics by which cycles\\r\\nare observed may become so blurred as to be almost unrecognizable. the\\r\\nresult of these various considerations is that the differences\\r\\nbetween animals and dead matter, when we confine ourselves to external\\r\\nunscientific observation of integral behaviour, are a matter of degree\\r\\nand not very precise. it is for this reason that it has always been\\r\\npossible for fanciful people to maintain that even stocks and stones\\r\\nhave some vague kind of soul. the evidence that animals have souls is\\r\\nso very shaky that, if it is assumed to be conclusive, one might just as\\r\\nwell go a step further and extend the argument by analogy to all matter.\\r\\nnevertheless, in spite of vagueness and doubtful cases, the existence\\r\\nof cycles in the behaviour of animals is a broad characteristic by which\\r\\nthey are prima facie distinguished from ordinary matter; and i think it\\r\\nis this characteristic which leads us to attribute desires to animals,\\r\\nsince it makes their behaviour resemble what we do when (as we say) we\\r\\nare acting from desire.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall adopt the following definitions for describing the behaviour of\\r\\nanimals:\\r\\n\\r\\na \"behaviour-cycle\" is a series of voluntary or reflex movements of an\\r\\nanimal, tending to cause a certain result, and continuing until that\\r\\nresult is caused, unless they are interrupted by death, accident,\\r\\nor some new behaviour-cycle. (here \"accident\" may be defined as the\\r\\nintervention of purely physical laws causing mechanical movements.)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe \"purpose\" of a behaviour-cycle is the result which brings it to an\\r\\nend, normally by a condition of temporary quiescence-provided there is\\r\\nno interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nan animal is said to \"desire\" the purpose of a behaviour cycle while the\\r\\nbehaviour-cycle is in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\ni believe these definitions to be adequate also to human purposes and\\r\\ndesires, but for the present i am only occupied with animals and with\\r\\nwhat can be learnt by external observation. i am very anxious that no\\r\\nideas should be attached to the words \"purpose\" and \"desire\" beyond\\r\\nthose involved in the above definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have not so far considered what is the nature of the initial stimulus\\r\\nto a behaviour-cycle. yet it is here that the usual view of desire seems\\r\\non the strongest ground. the hungry animal goes on making movements\\r\\nuntil it gets food; it seems natural, therefore, to suppose that the\\r\\nidea of food is present throughout the process, and that the thought of\\r\\nthe end to be achieved sets the whole process in motion. such a view,\\r\\nhowever, is obviously untenable in many cases, especially where instinct\\r\\nis concerned. take, for example, reproduction and the rearing of the\\r\\nyoung. birds mate, build a nest, lay eggs in it, sit on the eggs, feed\\r\\nthe young birds, and care for them until they are fully grown. it\\r\\nis totally impossible to suppose that this series of actions, which\\r\\nconstitutes one behaviour-cycle, is inspired by any prevision of the\\r\\nend, at any rate the first time it is performed.* we must suppose that\\r\\nthe stimulus to the performance of each act is an impulsion from behind,\\r\\nnot an attraction from the future. the bird does what it does, at each\\r\\nstage, because it has an impulse to that particular action, not because\\r\\nit perceives that the whole cycle of actions will contribute to the\\r\\npreservation of the species. the same considerations apply to other\\r\\ninstincts. a hungry animal feels restless, and is led by instinctive\\r\\nimpulses to perform the movements which give it nourishment; but the act\\r\\nof seeking food is not sufficient evidence from which to conclude that\\r\\nthe animal has the thought of food in its \"mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * for evidence as to birds\\' nests, cf. semon, \"die mneme,\"\\r\\n     pp. 209, 210.\\r\\n\\r\\ncoming now to human beings, and to what we know about our own actions,\\r\\nit seems clear that what, with us, sets a behaviour-cycle in motion is\\r\\nsome sensation of the sort which we call disagreeable. take the case\\r\\nof hunger: we have first an uncomfortable feeling inside, producing a\\r\\ndisinclination to sit still, a sensitiveness to savoury smells, and an\\r\\nattraction towards any food that there may be in our neighbourhood. at\\r\\nany moment during this process we may become aware that we are hungry,\\r\\nin the sense of saying to ourselves, \"i am hungry\"; but we may have been\\r\\nacting with reference to food for some time before this moment. while we\\r\\nare talking or reading, we may eat in complete unconsciousness; but we\\r\\nperform the actions of eating just as we should if we were conscious,\\r\\nand they cease when our hunger is appeased. what we call \"consciousness\"\\r\\nseems to be a mere spectator of the process; even when it issues orders,\\r\\nthey are usually, like those of a wise parent, just such as would have\\r\\nbeen obeyed even if they had not been given. this view may seem at first\\r\\nexaggerated, but the more our so-called volitions and their causes are\\r\\nexamined, the more it is forced upon us. the part played by words in all\\r\\nthis is complicated, and a potent source of confusions; i shall return\\r\\nto it later. for the present, i am still concerned with primitive\\r\\ndesire, as it exists in man, but in the form in which man shows his\\r\\naffinity to his animal ancestors.\\r\\n\\r\\nconscious desire is made up partly of what is essential to desire,\\r\\npartly of beliefs as to what we want. it is important to be clear as to\\r\\nthe part which does not consist of beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe primitive non-cognitive element in desire seems to be a push, not\\r\\na pull, an impulsion away from the actual, rather than an attraction\\r\\ntowards the ideal. certain sensations and other mental occurrences have\\r\\na property which we call discomfort; these cause such bodily movements\\r\\nas are likely to lead to their cessation. when the discomfort ceases,\\r\\nor even when it appreciably diminishes, we have sensations possessing a\\r\\nproperty which we call pleasure. pleasurable sensations either stimulate\\r\\nno action at all, or at most stimulate such action as is likely to\\r\\nprolong them. i shall return shortly to the consideration of what\\r\\ndiscomfort and pleasure are in themselves; for the present, it is\\r\\ntheir connection with action and desire that concerns us. abandoning\\r\\nmomentarily the standpoint of behaviourism, we may presume that hungry\\r\\nanimals experience sensations involving discomfort, and stimulating such\\r\\nmovements as seem likely to bring them to the food which is outside the\\r\\ncages. when they have reached the food and eaten it, their discomfort\\r\\nceases and their sensations become pleasurable. it seems, mistakenly, as\\r\\nif the animals had had this situation in mind throughout, when in fact\\r\\nthey have been continually pushed by discomfort. and when an animal\\r\\nis reflective, like some men, it comes to think that it had the final\\r\\nsituation in mind throughout; sometimes it comes to know what situation\\r\\nwill bring satisfaction, so that in fact the discomfort does bring the\\r\\nthought of what will allay it. nevertheless the sensation involving\\r\\ndiscomfort remains the prime mover.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis brings us to the question of the nature of discomfort and pleasure.\\r\\nsince kant it has been customary to recognize three great divisions of\\r\\nmental phenomena, which are typified by knowledge, desire and feeling,\\r\\nwhere \"feeling\" is used to mean pleasure and discomfort. of course,\\r\\n\"knowledge\" is too definite a word: the states of mind concerned are\\r\\ngrouped together as \"cognitive,\" and are to embrace not only beliefs,\\r\\nbut perceptions, doubts, and the understanding of concepts. \"desire,\"\\r\\nalso, is narrower than what is intended: for example, will is to be\\r\\nincluded in this category, and in fact every thing that involves any\\r\\nkind of striving, or \"conation\" as it is technically called. i do not\\r\\nmyself believe that there is any value in this threefold division of the\\r\\ncontents of mind. i believe that sensations (including images) supply\\r\\nall the \"stuff\" of the mind, and that everything else can be analysed\\r\\ninto groups of sensations related in various ways, or characteristics of\\r\\nsensations or of groups of sensations. as regards belief, i shall give\\r\\ngrounds for this view in later lectures. as regards desires, i have\\r\\ngiven some grounds in this lecture. for the present, it is pleasure and\\r\\ndiscomfort that concern us. there are broadly three theories that might\\r\\nbe held in regard to them. we may regard them as separate existing\\r\\nitems in those who experience them, or we may regard them as intrinsic\\r\\nqualities of sensations and other mental occurrences, or we may regard\\r\\nthem as mere names for the causal characteristics of the occurrences\\r\\nwhich are uncomfortable or pleasant. the first of these theories,\\r\\nnamely, that which regards discomfort and pleasure as actual contents in\\r\\nthose who experience them, has, i think, nothing conclusive to be said\\r\\nin its favour.* it is suggested chiefly by an ambiguity in the word\\r\\n\"pain,\" which has misled many people, including berkeley, whom it\\r\\nsupplied with one of his arguments for subjective idealism. we may use\\r\\n\"pain\" as the opposite of \"pleasure,\" and \"painful\" as the opposite of\\r\\n\"pleasant,\" or we may use \"pain\" to mean a certain sort of sensation, on\\r\\na level with the sensations of heat and cold and touch. the latter use\\r\\nof the word has prevailed in psychological literature, and it is now\\r\\nno longer used as the opposite of \"pleasure.\" dr. h. head, in a recent\\r\\npublication, has stated this distinction as follows:**\\r\\n\\r\\n     * various arguments in its favour are advanced by a.\\r\\n     wohlgemuth, \"on the feelings and their neural correlate,\\r\\n     with an examination of the nature of pain,\" \"british journal\\r\\n     of psychology,\" viii, 4. (1917). but as these arguments are\\r\\n     largely a reductio ad absurdum of other theories, among\\r\\n     which that which i am advocating is not included, i cannot\\r\\n     regard them as establishing their contention.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** \"sensation and the cerebral cortex,\" \"brain,\" vol. xli,\\r\\n     part ii (september, 1918), p. 90. cf. also wohlgemuth, loc.\\r\\n     cit. pp. 437, 450.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"it is necessary at the outset to distinguish clearly between\\r\\n\\'discomfort\\' and \\'pain.\\' pain is a distinct sensory quality equivalent\\r\\nto heat and cold, and its intensity can be roughly graded according to\\r\\nthe force expended in stimulation. discomfort, on the other hand,\\r\\nis that feeling-tone which is directly opposed to pleasure. it may\\r\\naccompany sensations not in themselves essentially painful; as for\\r\\ninstance that produced by tickling the sole of the foot. the reaction\\r\\nproduced by repeated pricking contains both these elements; for it\\r\\nevokes that sensory quality known as pain, accompanied by a disagreeable\\r\\nfeeling-tone, which we have called discomfort. on the other hand,\\r\\nexcessive pressure, except when applied directly over some nerve-trunk,\\r\\ntends to excite more discomfort than pain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe confusion between discomfort and pain has made people regard\\r\\ndiscomfort as a more substantial thing than it is, and this in turn has\\r\\nreacted upon the view taken of pleasure, since discomfort and pleasure\\r\\nare evidently on a level in this respect. as soon as discomfort is\\r\\nclearly distinguished from the sensation of pain, it becomes more\\r\\nnatural to regard discomfort and pleasure as properties of mental\\r\\noccurrences than to regard them as separate mental occurrences on their\\r\\nown account. i shall therefore dismiss the view that they are separate\\r\\nmental occurrences, and regard them as properties of such experiences as\\r\\nwould be called respectively uncomfortable and pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nit remains to be examined whether they are actual qualities of such\\r\\noccurrences, or are merely differences as to causal properties. i do not\\r\\nmyself see any way of deciding this question; either view seems equally\\r\\ncapable of accounting for the facts. if this is true, it is safer to\\r\\navoid the assumption that there are such intrinsic qualities of\\r\\nmental occurrences as are in question, and to assume only the causal\\r\\ndifferences which are undeniable. without condemning the intrinsic\\r\\ntheory, we can define discomfort and pleasure as consisting in causal\\r\\nproperties, and say only what will hold on either of the two theories.\\r\\nfollowing this course, we shall say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"discomfort\" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,\\r\\nconsisting in the fact that the occurrence in question stimulates\\r\\nvoluntary or reflex movements tending to produce some more or less\\r\\ndefinite change involving the cessation of the occurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"pleasure\" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,\\r\\nconsisting in the fact that the occurrence in question either does not\\r\\nstimulate any voluntary or reflex movement, or, if it does, stimulates\\r\\nonly such as tend to prolong the occurrence in question.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. thorndike, op. cit., p. 243.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"conscious\" desire, which we have now to consider, consists of desire\\r\\nin the sense hitherto discussed, together with a true belief as to its\\r\\n\"purpose,\" i.e. as to the state of affairs that will bring quiescence\\r\\nwith cessation of the discomfort. if our theory of desire is correct,\\r\\na belief as to its purpose may very well be erroneous, since only\\r\\nexperience can show what causes a discomfort to cease. when the\\r\\nexperience needed is common and simple, as in the case of hunger, a\\r\\nmistake is not very probable. but in other cases--e.g. erotic desire in\\r\\nthose who have had little or no experience of its satisfaction--mistakes\\r\\nare to be expected, and do in fact very often occur. the practice of\\r\\ninhibiting impulses, which is to a great extent necessary to civilized\\r\\nlife, makes mistakes easier, by preventing experience of the actions to\\r\\nwhich a desire would otherwise lead, and by often causing the inhibited\\r\\nimpulses themselves to be unnoticed or quickly forgotten. the perfectly\\r\\nnatural mistakes which thus arise constitute a large proportion of what\\r\\nis, mistakenly in part, called self-deception, and attributed by freud\\r\\nto the \"censor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there is a further point which needs emphasizing, namely, that a\\r\\nbelief that something is desired has often a tendency to cause the very\\r\\ndesire that is believed in. it is this fact that makes the effect of\\r\\n\"consciousness\" on desire so complicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we believe that we desire a certain state of affairs, that often\\r\\ntends to cause a real desire for it. this is due partly to the influence\\r\\nof words upon our emotions, in rhetoric for example, and partly to the\\r\\ngeneral fact that discomfort normally belongs to the belief that we\\r\\ndesire such-and-such a thing that we do not possess. thus what was\\r\\noriginally a false opinion as to the object of a desire acquires a\\r\\ncertain truth: the false opinion generates a secondary subsidiary\\r\\ndesire, which nevertheless becomes real. let us take an illustration.\\r\\nsuppose you have been jilted in a way which wounds your vanity. your\\r\\nnatural impulsive desire will be of the sort expressed in donne\\'s poem:\\r\\n\\r\\n     when by thy scorn, o murderess, i am dead,\\r\\n\\r\\nin which he explains how he will haunt the poor lady as a ghost, and\\r\\nprevent her from enjoying a moment\\'s peace. but two things stand in\\r\\nthe way of your expressing yourself so naturally: on the one hand, your\\r\\nvanity, which will not acknowledge how hard you are hit; on the other\\r\\nhand, your conviction that you are a civilized and humane person,\\r\\nwho could not possibly indulge so crude a desire as revenge. you will\\r\\ntherefore experience a restlessness which will at first seem quite\\r\\naimless, but will finally resolve itself in a conscious desire to change\\r\\nyour profession, or go round the world, or conceal your identity and\\r\\nlive in putney, like arnold bennett\\'s hero. although the prime cause of\\r\\nthis desire is a false judgment as to your previous unconscious desire,\\r\\nyet the new conscious desire has its own derivative genuineness, and may\\r\\ninfluence your actions to the extent of sending you round the world.\\r\\nthe initial mistake, however, will have effects of two kinds. first,\\r\\nin uncontrolled moments, under the influence of sleepiness or drink\\r\\nor delirium, you will say things calculated to injure the faithless\\r\\ndeceiver. secondly, you will find travel disappointing, and the east\\r\\nless fascinating than you had hoped--unless, some day, you hear that the\\r\\nwicked one has in turn been jilted. if this happens, you will believe\\r\\nthat you feel sincere sympathy, but you will suddenly be much more\\r\\ndelighted than before with the beauties of tropical islands or the\\r\\nwonders of chinese art. a secondary desire, derived from a false\\r\\njudgment as to a primary desire, has its own power of influencing\\r\\naction, and is therefore a real desire according to our definition.\\r\\nbut it has not the same power as a primary desire of bringing thorough\\r\\nsatisfaction when it is realized; so long as the primary desire remains\\r\\nunsatisfied, restlessness continues in spite of the secondary desire\\'s\\r\\nsuccess. hence arises a belief in the vanity of human wishes: the vain\\r\\nwishes are those that are secondary, but mistaken beliefs prevent us\\r\\nfrom realizing that they are secondary.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat may, with some propriety, be called self-deception arises through\\r\\nthe operation of desires for beliefs. we desire many things which it is\\r\\nnot in our power to achieve: that we should be universally popular and\\r\\nadmired, that our work should be the wonder of the age, and that the\\r\\nuniverse should be so ordered as to bring ultimate happiness to all,\\r\\nthough not to our enemies until they have repented and been purified\\r\\nby suffering. such desires are too large to be achieved through our own\\r\\nefforts. but it is found that a considerable portion of the satisfaction\\r\\nwhich these things would bring us if they were realized is to be\\r\\nachieved by the much easier operation of believing that they are or\\r\\nwill be realized. this desire for beliefs, as opposed to desire for the\\r\\nactual facts, is a particular case of secondary desire, and, like all\\r\\nsecondary desire its satisfaction does not lead to a complete cessation\\r\\nof the initial discomfort. nevertheless, desire for beliefs, as opposed\\r\\nto desire for facts, is exceedingly potent both individually and\\r\\nsocially. according to the form of belief desired, it is called vanity,\\r\\noptimism, or religion. those who have sufficient power usually imprison\\r\\nor put to death any one who tries to shake their faith in their own\\r\\nexcellence or in that of the universe; it is for this reason that\\r\\nseditious libel and blasphemy have always been, and still are, criminal\\r\\noffences.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is very largely through desires for beliefs that the primitive\\r\\nnature of desire has become so hidden, and that the part played by\\r\\nconsciousness has been so confusing and so exaggerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now summarize our analysis of desire and feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\na mental occurrence of any kind--sensation, image, belief, or\\r\\nemotion--may be a cause of a series of actions, continuing, unless\\r\\ninterrupted, until some more or less definite state of affairs is\\r\\nrealized. such a series of actions we call a \"behaviour-cycle.\" the\\r\\ndegree of definiteness may vary greatly: hunger requires only food in\\r\\ngeneral, whereas the sight of a particular piece of food raises a desire\\r\\nwhich requires the eating of that piece of food. the property of causing\\r\\nsuch a cycle of occurrences is called \"discomfort\"; the property of the\\r\\nmental occurrences in which the cycle ends is called \"pleasure.\" the\\r\\nactions constituting the cycle must not be purely mechanical, i.e. they\\r\\nmust be bodily movements in whose causation the special properties\\r\\nof nervous tissue are involved. the cycle ends in a condition of\\r\\nquiescence, or of such action as tends only to preserve the status quo.\\r\\nthe state of affairs in which this condition of quiescence is achieved\\r\\nis called the \"purpose\" of the cycle, and the initial mental occurrence\\r\\ninvolving discomfort is called a \"desire\" for the state of affairs that\\r\\nbrings quiescence. a desire is called \"conscious\" when it is accompanied\\r\\nby a true belief as to the state of affairs that will bring quiescence;\\r\\notherwise it is called \"unconscious.\" all primitive desire is\\r\\nunconscious, and in human beings beliefs as to the purposes of desires\\r\\nare often mistaken. these mistaken beliefs generate secondary desires,\\r\\nwhich cause various interesting complications in the psychology of human\\r\\ndesire, without fundamentally altering the character which it shares\\r\\nwith animal desire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture iv. influence of past history on present occurrences in living\\r\\norganisms\\r\\n\\r\\nin this lecture we shall be concerned with a very general characteristic\\r\\nwhich broadly, though not absolutely, distinguishes the behaviour\\r\\nof living organisms from that of dead matter. the characteristic in\\r\\nquestion is this:\\r\\n\\r\\nthe response of an organism to a given stimulus is very often dependent\\r\\nupon the past history of the organism, and not merely upon the stimulus\\r\\nand the hitherto discoverable present state of the organism.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis characteristic is embodied in the saying \"a burnt child fears the\\r\\nfire.\" the burn may have left no visible traces, yet it modifies the\\r\\nreaction of the child in the presence of fire. it is customary to assume\\r\\nthat, in such cases, the past operates by modifying the structure of the\\r\\nbrain, not directly. i have no wish to suggest that this hypothesis is\\r\\nfalse; i wish only to point out that it is a hypothesis. at the end of\\r\\nthe present lecture i shall examine the grounds in its favour. if we\\r\\nconfine ourselves to facts which have been actually observed, we must\\r\\nsay that past occurrences, in addition to the present stimulus and\\r\\nthe present ascertainable condition of the organism, enter into the\\r\\ncausation of the response.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe characteristic is not wholly confined to living organisms. for\\r\\nexample, magnetized steel looks just like steel which has not been\\r\\nmagnetized, but its behaviour is in some ways different. in the case\\r\\nof dead matter, however, such phenomena are less frequent and important\\r\\nthan in the case of living organisms, and it is far less difficult\\r\\nto invent satisfactory hypotheses as to the microscopic changes of\\r\\nstructure which mediate between the past occurrence and the present\\r\\nchanged response. in the case of living organisms, practically\\r\\neverything that is distinctive both of their physical and of their\\r\\nmental behaviour is bound up with this persistent influence of the past.\\r\\nfurther, speaking broadly, the change in response is usually of a kind\\r\\nthat is biologically advantageous to the organism.\\r\\n\\r\\nfollowing a suggestion derived from semon (\"die mneme,\" leipzig, 1904;\\r\\n2nd edition, 1908, english translation, allen & unwin, 1921; \"die\\r\\nmnemischen empfindungen,\" leipzig, 1909), we will give the name of\\r\\n\"mnemic phenomena\" to those responses of an organism which, so far as\\r\\nhitherto observed facts are concerned, can only be brought under causal\\r\\nlaws by including past occurrences in the history of the organism as\\r\\npart of the causes of the present response. i do not mean merely--what\\r\\nwould always be the case--that past occurrences are part of a chain of\\r\\ncauses leading to the present event. i mean that, in attempting to state\\r\\nthe proximate cause of the present event, some past event or events\\r\\nmust be included, unless we take refuge in hypothetical modifications of\\r\\nbrain structure. for example: you smell peat-smoke, and you recall some\\r\\noccasion when you smelt it before. the cause of your recollection, so\\r\\nfar as hitherto observable phenomena are concerned, consists both\\r\\nof the peat smoke (present stimulus) and of the former occasion (past\\r\\nexperience). the same stimulus will not produce the same recollection\\r\\nin another man who did not share your former experience, although the\\r\\nformer experience left no observable traces in the structure of the\\r\\nbrain. according to the maxim \"same cause, same effect,\" we cannot\\r\\ntherefore regard the peat-smoke alone as the cause of your recollection,\\r\\nsince it does not have the same effect in other cases. the cause of\\r\\nyour recollection must be both the peat-smoke and the past occurrence.\\r\\naccordingly your recollection is an instance of what we are calling\\r\\n\"mnemic phenomena.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore going further, it will be well to give illustrations of different\\r\\nclasses of mnemic phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) acquired habits.--in lecture ii we saw how animals can learn by\\r\\nexperience how to get out of cages or mazes, or perform other actions\\r\\nwhich are useful to them but not provided for by their instincts alone.\\r\\na cat which is put into a cage of which it has had experience behaves\\r\\ndifferently from the way in which it behaved at first. we can easily\\r\\ninvent hypotheses, which are quite likely to be true, as to connections\\r\\nin the brain caused by past experience, and themselves causing the\\r\\ndifferent response. but the observable fact is that the stimulus of\\r\\nbeing in the cage produces differing results with repetition, and that\\r\\nthe ascertainable cause of the cat\\'s behaviour is not merely the cage\\r\\nand its own ascertainable organization, but also its past history\\r\\nin regard to the cage. from our present point of view, the matter is\\r\\nindependent of the question whether the cat\\'s behaviour is due to some\\r\\nmental fact called \"knowledge,\" or displays a merely bodily habit. our\\r\\nhabitual knowledge is not always in our minds, but is called up by the\\r\\nappropriate stimuli. if we are asked \"what is the capital of france?\"\\r\\nwe answer \"paris,\" because of past experience; the past experience is as\\r\\nessential as the present question in the causation of our response. thus\\r\\nall our habitual knowledge consists of acquired habits, and comes under\\r\\nthe head of mnemic phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) images.--i shall have much to say about images in a later lecture;\\r\\nfor the present i am merely concerned with them in so far as they are\\r\\n\"copies\" of past sensations. when you hear new york spoken of, some\\r\\nimage probably comes into your mind, either of the place itself (if you\\r\\nhave been there), or of some picture of it (if you have not). the image\\r\\nis due to your past experience, as well as to the present stimulus of\\r\\nthe words \"new york.\" similarly, the images you have in dreams are\\r\\nall dependent upon your past experience, as well as upon the present\\r\\nstimulus to dreaming. it is generally believed that all images, in their\\r\\nsimpler parts, are copies of sensations; if so, their mnemic character\\r\\nis evident. this is important, not only on its own account, but also\\r\\nbecause, as we shall see later, images play an essential part in what is\\r\\ncalled \"thinking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) association.--the broad fact of association, on the mental side, is\\r\\nthat when we experience something which we have experienced before,\\r\\nit tends to call up the context of the former experience. the smell of\\r\\npeat-smoke recalling a former scene is an instance which we discussed a\\r\\nmoment ago. this is obviously a mnemic phenomenon. there is also a more\\r\\npurely physical association, which is indistinguishable from physical\\r\\nhabit. this is the kind studied by mr. thorndike in animals, where a\\r\\ncertain stimulus is associated with a certain act. this is the sort\\r\\nwhich is taught to soldiers in drilling, for example. in such a case\\r\\nthere need not be anything mental, but merely a habit of the body.\\r\\nthere is no essential distinction between association and habit, and the\\r\\nobservations which we made concerning habit as a mnemic phenomenon are\\r\\nequally applicable to association.\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) non-sensational elements in perception.--when we perceive any object\\r\\nof a familiar kind, much of what appears subjectively to be immediately\\r\\ngiven is really derived from past experience. when we see an object, say\\r\\na penny, we seem to be aware of its \"real\" shape we have the impression\\r\\nof something circular, not of something elliptical. in learning to draw,\\r\\nit is necessary to acquire the art of representing things according\\r\\nto the sensation, not according to the perception. and the visual\\r\\nappearance is filled out with feeling of what the object would be like\\r\\nto touch, and so on. this filling out and supplying of the \"real\" shape\\r\\nand so on consists of the most usual correlates of the sensational core\\r\\nin our perception. it may happen that, in the particular case, the real\\r\\ncorrelates are unusual; for example, if what we are seeing is a\\r\\ncarpet made to look like tiles. if so, the non-sensational part of our\\r\\nperception will be illusory, i.e. it will supply qualities which the\\r\\nobject in question does not in fact have. but as a rule objects do\\r\\nhave the qualities added by perception, which is to be expected,\\r\\nsince experience of what is usual is the cause of the addition. if our\\r\\nexperience had been different, we should not fill out sensation in\\r\\nthe same way, except in so far as the filling out is instinctive,\\r\\nnot acquired. it would seem that, in man, all that makes up space\\r\\nperception, including the correlation of sight and touch and so on, is\\r\\nalmost entirely acquired. in that case there is a large mnemic element\\r\\nin all the common perceptions by means of which we handle common\\r\\nobjects. and, to take another kind of instance, imagine what our\\r\\nastonishment would be if we were to hear a cat bark or a dog mew. this\\r\\nemotion would be dependent upon past experience, and would therefore be\\r\\na mnemic phenomenon according to the definition.\\r\\n\\r\\n(e) memory as knowledge.--the kind of memory of which i am now speaking\\r\\nis definite knowledge of some past event in one\\'s own experience.\\r\\nfrom time to time we remember things that have happened to us, because\\r\\nsomething in the present reminds us of them. exactly the same present\\r\\nfact would not call up the same memory if our past experience had been\\r\\ndifferent. thus our remembering is caused by--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the present stimulus,\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) the past occurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is therefore a mnemic phenomenon according to our definition. a\\r\\ndefinition of \"mnemic phenomena\" which did not include memory would,\\r\\nof course, be a bad one. the point of the definition is not that it\\r\\nincludes memory, but that it includes it as one of a class of phenomena\\r\\nwhich embrace all that is characteristic in the subject matter of\\r\\npsychology.\\r\\n\\r\\n(f) experience.--the word \"experience\" is often used very vaguely.\\r\\njames, as we saw, uses it to cover the whole primal stuff of the world,\\r\\nbut this usage seems objection able, since, in a purely physical world,\\r\\nthings would happen without there being any experience. it is only\\r\\nmnemic phenomena that embody experience. we may say that an animal\\r\\n\"experiences\" an occurrence when this occurrence modifies the animal\\'s\\r\\nsubsequent behaviour, i.e. when it is the mnemic portion of the cause of\\r\\nfuture occurrences in the animal\\'s life. the burnt child that fears the\\r\\nfire has \"experienced\" the fire, whereas a stick that has been thrown on\\r\\nand taken off again has not \"experienced\" anything, since it offers\\r\\nno more resistance than before to being thrown on. the essence of\\r\\n\"experience\" is the modification of behaviour produced by what is\\r\\nexperienced. we might, in fact, define one chain of experience, or one\\r\\nbiography, as a series of occurrences linked by mnemic causation. i\\r\\nthink it is this characteristic, more than any other, that distinguishes\\r\\nsciences dealing with living organisms from physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe best writer on mnemic phenomena known to me is richard semon, the\\r\\nfundamental part of whose theory i shall endeavour to summarize before\\r\\ngoing further:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen an organism, either animal or plant, is subjected to a stimulus,\\r\\nproducing in it some state of excitement, the removal of the stimulus\\r\\nallows it to return to a condition of equilibrium. but the new state\\r\\nof equilibrium is different from the old, as may be seen by the changed\\r\\ncapacity for reaction. the state of equilibrium before the stimulus may\\r\\nbe called the \"primary indifference-state\"; that after the cessation\\r\\nof the stimulus, the \"secondary indifference-state.\" we define the\\r\\n\"engraphic effect\" of a stimulus as the effect in making a difference\\r\\nbetween the primary and secondary indifference-states, and this\\r\\ndifference itself we define as the \"engram\" due to the stimulus. \"mnemic\\r\\nphenomena\" are defined as those due to engrams; in animals, they are\\r\\nspecially associated with the nervous system, but not exclusively, even\\r\\nin man.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen two stimuli occur together, one of them, occurring afterwards,\\r\\nmay call out the reaction for the other also. we call this an \"ekphoric\\r\\ninfluence,\" and stimuli having this character are called \"ekphoric\\r\\nstimuli.\" in such a case we call the engrams of the two stimuli\\r\\n\"associated.\" all simultaneously generated engrams are associated; there\\r\\nis also association of successively aroused engrams, though this is\\r\\nreducible to simultaneous association. in fact, it is not an isolated\\r\\nstimulus that leaves an engram, but the totality of the stimuli at any\\r\\nmoment; consequently any portion of this totality tends, if it recurs,\\r\\nto arouse the whole reaction which was aroused before. semon holds that\\r\\nengrams can be inherited, and that an animal\\'s innate habits may be due\\r\\nto the experience of its ancestors; on this subject he refers to samuel\\r\\nbutler.\\r\\n\\r\\nsemon formulates two \"mnemic principles.\" the first, or \"law of\\r\\nengraphy,\" is as follows: \"all simultaneous excitements in an organism\\r\\nform a connected simultaneous excitement-complex, which as such works\\r\\nengraphically, i.e. leaves behind a connected engram-complex, which\\r\\nin so far forms a whole\" (\"die mnemischen empfindungen,\" p. 146).\\r\\nthe second mnemic principle, or \"law of ekphory,\" is as follows:\\r\\n\"the partial return of the energetic situation which formerly worked\\r\\nengraphically operates ekphorically on a simultaneous engram-complex\"\\r\\n(ib., p. 173). these two laws together represent in part a hypothesis\\r\\n(the engram), and in part an observable fact. the observable fact is\\r\\nthat, when a certain complex of stimuli has originally caused a certain\\r\\ncomplex of reactions, the recurrence of part of the stimuli tends to\\r\\ncause the recurrence of the whole of the reactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nsemon\\'s applications of his fundamental ideas in various directions are\\r\\ninteresting and ingenious. some of them will concern us later, but for\\r\\nthe present it is the fundamental character of mnemic phenomena that is\\r\\nin question.\\r\\n\\r\\nconcerning the nature of an engram, semon confesses that at present it\\r\\nis impossible to say more than that it must consist in some material\\r\\nalteration in the body of the organism (\"die mnemischen empfindungen,\"\\r\\np. 376). it is, in fact, hypothetical, invoked for theoretical uses, and\\r\\nnot an outcome of direct observation. no doubt physiology, especially\\r\\nthe disturbances of memory through lesions in the brain, affords grounds\\r\\nfor this hypothesis; nevertheless it does remain a hypothesis, the\\r\\nvalidity of which will be discussed at the end of this lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\ni am inclined to think that, in the present state of physiology, the\\r\\nintroduction of the engram does not serve to simplify the account of\\r\\nmnemic phenomena. we can, i think, formulate the known laws of such\\r\\nphenomena in terms, wholly, of observable facts, by recognizing\\r\\nprovisionally what we may call \"mnemic causation.\" by this i mean that\\r\\nkind of causation of which i spoke at the beginning of this lecture,\\r\\nthat kind, namely, in which the proximate cause consists not merely of a\\r\\npresent event, but of this together with a past event. i do not wish to\\r\\nurge that this form of causation is ultimate, but that, in the present\\r\\nstate of our knowledge, it affords a simplification, and enables us\\r\\nto state laws of behaviour in less hypothetical terms than we should\\r\\notherwise have to employ.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe clearest instance of what i mean is recollection of a past event.\\r\\nwhat we observe is that certain present stimuli lead us to recollect\\r\\ncertain occurrences, but that at times when we are not recollecting\\r\\nthem, there is nothing discoverable in our minds that could be called\\r\\nmemory of them. memories, as mental facts, arise from time to time,\\r\\nbut do not, so far as we can see, exist in any shape while they are\\r\\n\"latent.\" in fact, when we say that they are \"latent,\" we mean merely\\r\\nthat they will exist under certain circumstances. if, then, there is\\r\\nto be some standing difference between the person who can remember a\\r\\ncertain fact and the person who cannot, that standing difference must\\r\\nbe, not in anything mental, but in the brain. it is quite probable that\\r\\nthere is such a difference in the brain, but its nature is unknown and\\r\\nit remains hypothetical. everything that has, so far, been made matter\\r\\nof observation as regards this question can be put together in the\\r\\nstatement: when a certain complex of sensations has occurred to a man,\\r\\nthe recurrence of part of the complex tends to arouse the recollection\\r\\nof the whole. in like manner, we can collect all mnemic phenomena in\\r\\nliving organisms under a single law, which contains what is hitherto\\r\\nverifiable in semon\\'s two laws. this single law is:\\r\\n\\r\\nif a complex stimulus a has caused a complex reaction b in an organism,\\r\\nthe occurrence of a part of a on a future occasion tends to cause the\\r\\nwhole reaction b.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis law would need to be supplemented by some account of the influence\\r\\nof frequency, and so on; but it seems to contain the essential\\r\\ncharacteristic of mnemic phenomena, without admixture of anything\\r\\nhypothetical.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhenever the effect resulting from a stimulus to an organism differs\\r\\naccording to the past history of the organism, without our being able\\r\\nactually to detect any relevant difference in its present structure,\\r\\nwe will speak of \"mnemic causation,\" provided we can discover laws\\r\\nembodying the influence of the past. in ordinary physical causation,\\r\\nas it appears to common sense, we have approximate uniformities of\\r\\nsequence, such as \"lightning is followed by thunder,\" \"drunkenness\\r\\nis followed by headache,\" and so on. none of these sequences are\\r\\ntheoretically invariable, since something may intervene to disturb\\r\\nthem. in order to obtain invariable physical laws, we have to proceed to\\r\\ndifferential equations, showing the direction of change at each moment,\\r\\nnot the integral change after a finite interval, however short. but\\r\\nfor the purposes of daily life many sequences are to all in tents and\\r\\npurposes invariable. with the behaviour of human beings, however, this\\r\\nis by no means the case. if you say to an englishman, \"you have a smut\\r\\non your nose,\" he will proceed to remove it, but there will be no such\\r\\neffect if you say the same thing to a frenchman who knows no english.\\r\\nthe effect of words upon the hearer is a mnemic phenomena, since it\\r\\ndepends upon the past experience which gave him understanding of the\\r\\nwords. if there are to be purely psychological causal laws, taking no\\r\\naccount of the brain and the rest of the body, they will have to be of\\r\\nthe form, not \"x now causes y now,\" but--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"a, b, c,... in the past, together with x now, cause y now.\" for it\\r\\ncannot be successfully maintained that our understanding of a word, for\\r\\nexample, is an actual existent content of the mind at times when we\\r\\nare not thinking of the word. it is merely what may be called a\\r\\n\"disposition,\" i.e. it is capable of being aroused whenever we hear the\\r\\nword or happen to think of it. a \"disposition\" is not something actual,\\r\\nbut merely the mnemic portion of a mnemic causal law.\\r\\n\\r\\nin such a law as \"a, b, c,... in the past, together with x now, cause\\r\\ny now,\" we will call a, b, c,... the mnemic cause, x the occasion or\\r\\nstimulus, and y the reaction. all cases in which experience influences\\r\\nbehaviour are instances of mnemic causation.\\r\\n\\r\\nbelievers in psycho-physical parallelism hold that psychology can\\r\\ntheoretically be freed entirely from all dependence on physiology or\\r\\nphysics. that is to say, they believe that every psychical event has\\r\\na psychical cause and a physical concomitant. if there is to be\\r\\nparallelism, it is easy to prove by mathematical logic that the\\r\\ncausation in physical and psychical matters must be of the same sort,\\r\\nand it is impossible that mnemic causation should exist in psychology\\r\\nbut not in physics. but if psychology is to be independent of\\r\\nphysiology, and if physiology can be reduced to physics, it would seem\\r\\nthat mnemic causation is essential in psychology. otherwise we shall be\\r\\ncompelled to believe that all our knowledge, all our store of images\\r\\nand memories, all our mental habits, are at all times existing in some\\r\\nlatent mental form, and are not merely aroused by the stimuli which lead\\r\\nto their display. this is a very difficult hypothesis. it seems to me\\r\\nthat if, as a matter of method rather than metaphysics, we desire to\\r\\nobtain as much independence for psychology as is practically feasible,\\r\\nwe shall do better to accept mnemic causation in psychology protem,\\r\\nand therefore reject parallelism, since there is no good ground for\\r\\nadmitting mnemic causation in physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is perhaps worth while to observe that mnemic causation is what led\\r\\nbergson to deny that there is causation at all in the psychical sphere.\\r\\nhe points out, very truly, that the same stimulus, repeated, does not\\r\\nhave the same consequences, and he argues that this is contrary to the\\r\\nmaxim, \"same cause, same effect.\" it is only necessary, however, to take\\r\\naccount of past occurrences and include them with the cause, in order\\r\\nto re-establish the maxim, and the possibility of psychological causal\\r\\nlaws. the metaphysical conception of a cause lingers in our manner of\\r\\nviewing causal laws: we want to be able to feel a connection between\\r\\ncause and effect, and to be able to imagine the cause as \"operating.\"\\r\\nthis makes us unwilling to regard causal laws as merely observed\\r\\nuniformities of sequence; yet that is all that science has to offer.\\r\\nto ask why such-and-such a kind of sequence occurs is either to ask a\\r\\nmeaningless question, or to demand some more general kind of sequence\\r\\nwhich includes the one in question. the widest empirical laws of\\r\\nsequence known at any time can only be \"explained\" in the sense of being\\r\\nsubsumed by later discoveries under wider laws; but these wider laws,\\r\\nuntil they in turn are subsumed, will remain brute facts, resting solely\\r\\nupon observation, not upon some supposed inherent rationality.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is therefore no a priori objection to a causal law in which part\\r\\nof the cause has ceased to exist. to argue against such a law on the\\r\\nground that what is past cannot operate now, is to introduce the old\\r\\nmetaphysical notion of cause, for which science can find no place. the\\r\\nonly reason that could be validly alleged against mnemic causation would\\r\\nbe that, in fact, all the phenomena can be explained without it. they\\r\\nare explained without it by semon\\'s \"engram,\" or by any theory which\\r\\nregards the results of experience as embodied in modifications of\\r\\nthe brain and nerves. but they are not explained, unless with extreme\\r\\nartificiality, by any theory which regards the latent effects of\\r\\nexperience as psychical rather than physical. those who desire to make\\r\\npsychology as far as possible independent of physiology would do well,\\r\\nit seems to me, if they adopted mnemic causation. for my part, however,\\r\\ni have no such desire, and i shall therefore endeavour to state the\\r\\ngrounds which occur to me in favour of some such view as that of the\\r\\n\"engram.\"\\r\\n\\r\\none of the first points to be urged is that mnemic phenomena are just\\r\\nas much to be found in physiology as in psychology. they are even to\\r\\nbe found in plants, as sir francis darwin pointed out (cf. semon, \"die\\r\\nmneme,\" 2nd edition, p. 28 n.). habit is a characteristic of the body\\r\\nat least as much as of the mind. we should, therefore, be compelled\\r\\nto allow the intrusion of mnemic causation, if admitted at all, into\\r\\nnon-psychological regions, which ought, one feels, to be subject only to\\r\\ncausation of the ordinary physical sort. the fact is that a great deal\\r\\nof what, at first sight, distinguishes psychology from physics is found,\\r\\non examination, to be common to psychology and physiology; this whole\\r\\nquestion of the influence of experience is a case in point. now it\\r\\nis possible, of course, to take the view advocated by professor j. s.\\r\\nhaldane, who contends that physiology is not theoretically reducible to\\r\\nphysics and chemistry.* but the weight of opinion among physiologists\\r\\nappears to be against him on this point; and we ought certainly to\\r\\nrequire very strong evidence before admitting any such breach of\\r\\ncontinuity as between living and dead matter. the argument from the\\r\\nexistence of mnemic phenomena in physiology must therefore be allowed a\\r\\ncertain weight against the hypothesis that mnemic causation is ultimate.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see his \"the new physiology and other addresses,\" griffin,\\r\\n     1919, also the symposium, \"are physical, biological and\\r\\n     psychological categories irreducible?\" in \"life and finite\\r\\n     individuality,\" edited for the aristotelian society, with an\\r\\n     introduction. by h. wildon carr, williams & norgate, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe argument from the connection of brain-lesions with loss of memory is\\r\\nnot so strong as it looks, though it has also, some weight. what we\\r\\nknow is that memory, and mnemic phenomena generally, can be disturbed or\\r\\ndestroyed by changes in the brain. this certainly proves that the brain\\r\\nplays an essential part in the causation of memory, but does not prove\\r\\nthat a certain state of the brain is, by itself, a sufficient condition\\r\\nfor the existence of memory. yet it is this last that has to be proved.\\r\\nthe theory of the engram, or any similar theory, has to maintain that,\\r\\ngiven a body and brain in a suitable state, a man will have a certain\\r\\nmemory, without the need of any further conditions. what is known,\\r\\nhowever, is only that he will not have memories if his body and brain\\r\\nare not in a suitable state. that is to say, the appropriate state\\r\\nof body and brain is proved to be necessary for memory, but not to be\\r\\nsufficient. so far, therefore, as our definite knowledge goes, memory\\r\\nmay require for its causation a past occurrence as well as a certain\\r\\npresent state of the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to prove conclusively that mnemic phenomena arise whenever\\r\\ncertain physiological conditions are fulfilled, we ought to be able\\r\\nactually to see differences between the brain of a man who speaks\\r\\nenglish and that of a man who speaks french, between the brain of a man\\r\\nwho has seen new york and can recall it, and that of a man who has never\\r\\nseen that city. it may be that the time will come when this will be\\r\\npossible, but at present we are very far removed from it. at present,\\r\\nthere is, so far as i am aware, no good evidence that every difference\\r\\nbetween the knowledge possessed by a and that possessed by b is\\r\\nparalleled by some difference in their brains. we may believe that\\r\\nthis is the case, but if we do, our belief is based upon analogies\\r\\nand general scientific maxims, not upon any foundation of detailed\\r\\nobservation. i am myself inclined, as a working hypothesis, to adopt\\r\\nthe belief in question, and to hold that past experience only affects\\r\\npresent behaviour through modifications of physiological structure. but\\r\\nthe evidence seems not quite conclusive, so that i do not think we ought\\r\\nto forget the other hypothesis, or to reject entirely the possibility\\r\\nthat mnemic causation may be the ultimate explanation of mnemic\\r\\nphenomena. i say this, not because i think it likely that mnemic\\r\\ncausation is ultimate, but merely because i think it possible, and\\r\\nbecause it often turns out important to the progress of science to\\r\\nremember hypotheses which have previously seemed improbable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture v. psychological and physical causal laws\\r\\n\\r\\nthe traditional conception of cause and effect is one which modern\\r\\nscience shows to be fundamentally erroneous, and requiring to be\\r\\nreplaced by a quite different notion, that of laws of change. in the\\r\\ntraditional conception, a particular event a caused a particular event\\r\\nb, and by this it was implied that, given any event b, some earlier\\r\\nevent a could be discovered which had a relation to it, such that--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) whenever a occurred, it was followed by b;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) in this sequence, there was something \"necessary,\" not a mere de\\r\\nfacto occurrence of a first and then b.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second point is illustrated by the old discussion as to whether\\r\\nit can be said that day causes night, on the ground that day is always\\r\\nfollowed by night. the orthodox answer was that day could not be called\\r\\nthe cause of night, because it would not be followed by night if the\\r\\nearth\\'s rotation were to cease, or rather to grow so slow that one\\r\\ncomplete rotation would take a year. a cause, it was held, must be such\\r\\nthat under no conceivable circumstances could it fail to be followed by\\r\\nits effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nas a matter of fact, such sequences as were sought by believers in the\\r\\ntraditional form of causation have not so far been found in nature.\\r\\neverything in nature is apparently in a state of continuous change,* so\\r\\nthat what we call one \"event\" turns out to be really a process. if this\\r\\nevent is to cause another event, the two will have to be contiguous in\\r\\ntime; for if there is any interval between them, something may happen\\r\\nduring that interval to prevent the expected effect. cause and effect,\\r\\ntherefore, will have to be temporally contiguous processes. it is\\r\\ndifficult to believe, at any rate where physical laws are concerned,\\r\\nthat the earlier part of the process which is the cause can make any\\r\\ndifference to the effect, so long as the later part of the process which\\r\\nis the cause remains unchanged. suppose, for example, that a man dies\\r\\nof arsenic poisoning, we say that his taking arsenic was the cause\\r\\nof death. but clearly the process by which he acquired the arsenic\\r\\nis irrelevant: everything that happened before he swallowed it may be\\r\\nignored, since it cannot alter the effect except in so far as it alters\\r\\nhis condition at the moment of taking the dose. but we may go further:\\r\\nswallowing arsenic is not really the proximate cause of death, since a\\r\\nman might be shot through the head immediately after taking the dose,\\r\\nand then it would not be of arsenic that he would die. the arsenic\\r\\nproduces certain physiological changes, which take a finite time before\\r\\nthey end in death. the earlier parts of these changes can be ruled out\\r\\nin the same way as we can rule out the process by which the arsenic was\\r\\nacquired. proceeding in this way, we can shorten the process which we\\r\\nare calling the cause more and more. similarly we shall have to shorten\\r\\nthe effect. it may happen that immediately after the man\\'s death his\\r\\nbody is blown to pieces by a bomb. we cannot say what will happen after\\r\\nthe man\\'s death, through merely knowing that he has died as the result\\r\\nof arsenic poisoning. thus, if we are to take the cause as one event and\\r\\nthe effect as another, both must be shortened indefinitely. the result\\r\\nis that we merely have, as the embodiment of our causal law, a certain\\r\\ndirection of change at each moment. hence we are brought to differential\\r\\nequations as embodying causal laws. a physical law does not say \"a will\\r\\nbe followed by b,\" but tells us what acceleration a particle will have\\r\\nunder given circumstances, i.e. it tells us how the particle\\'s motion is\\r\\nchanging at each moment, not where the particle will be at some future\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * the theory of quanta suggests that the continuity is only\\r\\n     apparent. if so, we shall be able theoretically to reach\\r\\n     events which are not processes. but in what is directly\\r\\n     observable there is still apparent continuity, which\\r\\n     justifies the above remarks for the prevent.\\r\\n\\r\\nlaws embodied in differential equations may possibly be exact,\\r\\nbut cannot be known to be so. all that we can know empirically is\\r\\napproximate and liable to exceptions; the exact laws that are assumed in\\r\\nphysics are known to be somewhere near the truth, but are not known to\\r\\nbe true just as they stand. the laws that we actually know empirically\\r\\nhave the form of the traditional causal laws, except that they are not\\r\\nto be regarded as universal or necessary. \"taking arsenic is followed by\\r\\ndeath\" is a good empirical generalization; it may have exceptions, but\\r\\nthey will be rare. as against the professedly exact laws of physics,\\r\\nsuch empirical generalizations have the advantage that they deal with\\r\\nobservable phenomena. we cannot observe infinitesimals, whether in time\\r\\nor space; we do not even know whether time and space are infinitely\\r\\ndivisible. therefore rough empirical generalizations have a definite\\r\\nplace in science, in spite of not being exact of universal. they are the\\r\\ndata for more exact laws, and the grounds for believing that they are\\r\\nusually true are stronger than the grounds for believing that the more\\r\\nexact laws are always true.\\r\\n\\r\\nscience starts, therefore, from generalizations of the form, \"a is\\r\\nusually followed by b.\" this is the nearest approach that can be made\\r\\nto a causal law of the traditional sort. it may happen in any particular\\r\\ninstance that a is always followed by b, but we cannot know this, since\\r\\nwe cannot foresee all the perfectly possible circumstances that might\\r\\nmake the sequence fail, or know that none of them will actually occur.\\r\\nif, however, we know of a very large number of cases in which a is\\r\\nfollowed by b, and few or none in which the sequence fails, we shall in\\r\\npractice be justified in saying \"a causes b,\" provided we do not attach\\r\\nto the notion of cause any of the metaphysical superstitions that have\\r\\ngathered about the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is another point, besides lack of universality and necessity,\\r\\nwhich it is important to realize as regards causes in the above sense,\\r\\nand that is the lack of uniqueness. it is generally assumed that, given\\r\\nany event, there is some one phenomenon which is the cause of the event\\r\\nin question. this seems to be a mere mistake. cause, in the only\\r\\nsense in which it can be practically applied, means \"nearly invariable\\r\\nantecedent.\" we cannot in practice obtain an antecedent which is quite\\r\\ninvariable, for this would require us to take account of the whole\\r\\nuniverse, since something not taken account of may prevent the expected\\r\\neffect. we cannot distinguish, among nearly invariable antecedents, one\\r\\nas the cause, and the others as merely its concomitants: the attempt to\\r\\ndo this depends upon a notion of cause which is derived from will, and\\r\\nwill (as we shall see later) is not at all the sort of thing that it is\\r\\ngenerally supposed to be, nor is there any reason to think that in the\\r\\nphysical world there is anything even remotely analogous to what will is\\r\\nsupposed to be. if we could find one antecedent, and only one, that was\\r\\nquite invariable, we could call that one the cause without introducing\\r\\nany notion derived from mistaken ideas about will. but in fact we cannot\\r\\nfind any antecedent that we know to be quite invariable, and we can find\\r\\nmany that are nearly so. for example, men leave a factory for dinner\\r\\nwhen the hooter sounds at twelve o\\'clock. you may say the hooter is\\r\\nthe cause of their leaving. but innumerable other hooters in other\\r\\nfactories, which also always sound at twelve o\\'clock, have just as\\r\\ngood a right to be called the cause. thus every event has many nearly\\r\\ninvariable antecedents, and therefore many antecedents which may be\\r\\ncalled its cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe laws of traditional physics, in the form in which they deal with\\r\\nmovements of matter or electricity, have an apparent simplicity which\\r\\nsomewhat conceals the empirical character of what they assert. a piece\\r\\nof matter, as it is known empirically, is not a single existing thing,\\r\\nbut a system of existing things. when several people simultaneously see\\r\\nthe same table, they all see something different; therefore \"the\" table,\\r\\nwhich they are supposed all to see, must be either a hypothesis or\\r\\na construction. \"the\" table is to be neutral as between different\\r\\nobservers: it does not favour the aspect seen by one man at the expense\\r\\nof that seen by another. it was natural, though to my mind mistaken, to\\r\\nregard the \"real\" table as the common cause of all the appearances which\\r\\nthe table presents (as we say) to different observers. but why should we\\r\\nsuppose that there is some one common cause of all these appearances? as\\r\\nwe have just seen, the notion of \"cause\" is not so reliable as to allow\\r\\nus to infer the existence of something that, by its very nature, can\\r\\nnever be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\ninstead of looking for an impartial source, we can secure neutrality by\\r\\nthe equal representation of all parties. instead of supposing that there\\r\\nis some unknown cause, the \"real\" table, behind the different sensations\\r\\nof those who are said to be looking at the table, we may take the\\r\\nwhole set of these sensations (together possibly with certain other\\r\\nparticulars) as actually being the table. that is to say, the table\\r\\nwhich is neutral as between different observers (actual and possible)\\r\\nis the set of all those particulars which would naturally be called\\r\\n\"aspects\" of the table from different points of view. (this is a first\\r\\napproximation, modified later.)\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be said: if there is no single existent which is the source of\\r\\nall these \"aspects,\" how are they collected together? the answer is\\r\\nsimple: just as they would be if there were such a single existent. the\\r\\nsupposed \"real\" table underlying its appearances is, in any case, not\\r\\nitself perceived, but inferred, and the question whether such-and-such\\r\\na particular is an \"aspect\" of this table is only to be settled by\\r\\nthe connection of the particular in question with the one or more\\r\\nparticulars by which the table is defined. that is to say, even if we\\r\\nassume a \"real\" table, the particulars which are its aspects have to be\\r\\ncollected together by their relations to each other, not to it, since\\r\\nit is merely inferred from them. we have only, therefore, to notice how\\r\\nthey are collected together, and we can then keep the collection\\r\\nwithout assuming any \"real\" table as distinct from the collection. when\\r\\ndifferent people see what they call the same table, they see things\\r\\nwhich are not exactly the same, owing to difference of point of view,\\r\\nbut which are sufficiently alike to be described in the same words, so\\r\\nlong as no great accuracy or minuteness is sought. these closely similar\\r\\nparticulars are collected together by their similarity primarily\\r\\nand, more correctly, by the fact that they are related to each other\\r\\napproximately according to the laws of perspective and of reflection and\\r\\ndiffraction of light. i suggest, as a first approximation, that these\\r\\nparticulars, together with such correlated others as are unperceived,\\r\\njointly are the table; and that a similar definition applies to all\\r\\nphysical objects.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     *see \"our knowledge of the external world\" (allen & unwin),\\r\\n     chaps. iii and iv.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to eliminate the reference to our perceptions, which introduces\\r\\nan irrelevant psychological suggestion, i will take a different\\r\\nillustration, namely, stellar photography. a photographic plate exposed\\r\\non a clear night reproduces the appearance of the portion of the sky\\r\\nconcerned, with more or fewer stars according to the power of the\\r\\ntelescope that is being used. each separate star which is photographed\\r\\nproduces its separate effect on the plate, just as it would upon\\r\\nourselves if we were looking at the sky. if we assume, as science\\r\\nnormally does, the continuity of physical processes, we are forced\\r\\nto conclude that, at the place where the plate is, and at all places\\r\\nbetween it and a star which it photographs, something is happening which\\r\\nis specially connected with that star. in the days when the aether was\\r\\nless in doubt, we should have said that what was happening was a certain\\r\\nkind of transverse vibration in the aether. but it is not necessary\\r\\nor desirable to be so explicit: all that we need say is that something\\r\\nhappens which is specially connected with the star in question. it\\r\\nmust be something specially connected with that star, since that star\\r\\nproduces its own special effect upon the plate. whatever it is must be\\r\\nthe end of a process which starts from the star and radiates outwards,\\r\\npartly on general grounds of continuity, partly to account for the fact\\r\\nthat light is transmitted with a certain definite velocity. we thus\\r\\narrive at the conclusion that, if a certain star is visible at a certain\\r\\nplace, or could be photographed by a sufficiently sensitive plate at\\r\\nthat place, something is happening there which is specially connected\\r\\nwith that star. therefore in every place at all times a vast multitude\\r\\nof things must be happening, namely, at least one for every physical\\r\\nobject which can be seen or photographed from that place. we can\\r\\nclassify such happenings on either of two principles:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) we can collect together all the happenings in one place, as is done\\r\\nby photography so far as light is concerned;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) we can collect together all the happenings, in different places,\\r\\nwhich are connected in the way that common sense regards as being due to\\r\\ntheir emanating from one object.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus, to return to the stars, we can collect together either--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) all the appearances of different stars in a given place, or,\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) all the appearances of a given star in different places.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut when i speak of \"appearances,\" i do so only for brevity: i do not\\r\\nmean anything that must \"appear\" to somebody, but only that happening,\\r\\nwhatever it may be, which is connected, at the place in question, with a\\r\\ngiven physical object--according to the old orthodox theory, it would be\\r\\na transverse vibration in the aether. like the different appearances\\r\\nof the table to a number of simultaneous observers, the different\\r\\nparticulars that belong to one physical object are to be collected\\r\\ntogether by continuity and inherent laws of correlation, not by their\\r\\nsupposed causal connection with an unknown assumed existent called a\\r\\npiece of matter, which would be a mere unnecessary metaphysical thing in\\r\\nitself. a piece of matter, according to the definition that i propose,\\r\\nis, as a first approximation,* the collection of all those correlated\\r\\nparticulars which would normally be regarded as its appearances or\\r\\neffects in different places. some further elaborations are desirable,\\r\\nbut we can ignore them for the present. i shall return to them at the\\r\\nend of this lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n     *the exact definition of a piece of matter as a construction\\r\\n     will be given later.\\r\\n\\r\\naccording to the view that i am suggesting, a physical object or piece\\r\\nof matter is the collection of all those correlated particulars which\\r\\nwould be regarded by common sense as its effects or appearances in\\r\\ndifferent places. on the other hand, all the happenings in a given place\\r\\nrepresent what common sense would regard as the appearances of a number\\r\\nof different objects as viewed from that place. all the happenings in\\r\\none place may be regarded as the view of the world from that place. i\\r\\nshall call the view of the world from a given place a \"perspective.\" a\\r\\nphotograph represents a perspective. on the other hand, if photographs\\r\\nof the stars were taken in all points throughout space, and in all such\\r\\nphotographs a certain star, say sirius, were picked out whenever it\\r\\nappeared, all the different appearances of sirius, taken together,\\r\\nwould represent sirius. for the understanding of the difference between\\r\\npsychology and physics it is vital to understand these two ways of\\r\\nclassifying particulars, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) according to the place where they occur;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) according to the system of correlated particulars in different\\r\\nplaces to which they belong, such system being defined as a physical\\r\\nobject.\\r\\n\\r\\ngiven a system of particulars which is a physical object, i shall\\r\\ndefine that one of the system which is in a given place (if any) as the\\r\\n\"appearance of that object in that place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the appearance of an object in a given place changes, it is found\\r\\nthat one or other of two things occurs. the two possibilities may be\\r\\nillustrated by an example. you are in a room with a man, whom you see:\\r\\nyou may cease to see him either by shutting your eyes or by his going\\r\\nout of the room. in the first case, his appearance to other people\\r\\nremains unchanged; in the second, his appearance changes from all\\r\\nplaces. in the first case, you say that it is not he who has changed,\\r\\nbut your eyes; in the second, you say that he has changed. generalizing,\\r\\nwe distinguish--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) cases in which only certain appearances of the object change, while\\r\\nothers, and especially appearances from places very near to the object,\\r\\ndo not change;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) cases where all, or almost all, the appearances of the object\\r\\nundergo a connected change.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the first case, the change is attributed to the medium between the\\r\\nobject and the place; in the second, it is attributed to the object\\r\\nitself.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * the application of this distinction to motion raises\\r\\n     complications due to relativity, but we may ignore these for\\r\\n     our present purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is the frequency of the latter kind of change, and the comparatively\\r\\nsimple nature of the laws governing the simultaneous alterations\\r\\nof appearances in such cases, that have made it possible to treat a\\r\\nphysical object as one thing, and to overlook the fact that it is a\\r\\nsystem of particulars. when a number of people at a theatre watch an\\r\\nactor, the changes in their several perspectives are so similar and so\\r\\nclosely correlated that all are popularly regarded as identical with\\r\\neach other and with the changes of the actor himself. so long as all\\r\\nthe changes in the appearances of a body are thus correlated there is no\\r\\npressing prima facie need to break up the system of appearances, or to\\r\\nrealize that the body in question is not really one thing but a set of\\r\\ncorrelated particulars. it is especially and primarily such changes that\\r\\nphysics deals with, i.e. it deals primarily with processes in which\\r\\nthe unity of a physical object need not be broken up because all its\\r\\nappearances change simultaneously according to the same law--or, if not\\r\\nall, at any rate all from places sufficiently near to the object, with\\r\\nin creasing accuracy as we approach the object.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe changes in appearances of an object which are due to changes in the\\r\\nintervening medium will not affect, or will affect only very slightly,\\r\\nthe appearances from places close to the object. if the appearances\\r\\nfrom sufficiently neighbouring places are either wholly un changed,\\r\\nor changed to a diminishing extent which has zero for its limit, it\\r\\nis usually found that the changes can be accounted for by changes in\\r\\nobjects which are between the object in question and the places from\\r\\nwhich its appearance has changed appreciably. thus physics is able\\r\\nto reduce the laws of most changes with which it deals to changes in\\r\\nphysical objects, and to state most of its fundamental laws in terms of\\r\\nmatter. it is only in those cases in which the unity of the system of\\r\\nappearances constituting a piece of matter has to be broken up, that the\\r\\nstatement of what is happening cannot be made exclusively in terms of\\r\\nmatter. the whole of psychology, we shall find, is included among such\\r\\ncases; hence their importance for our purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now begin to understand one of the fundamental differences\\r\\nbetween physics and psychology. physics treats as a unit the whole\\r\\nsystem of appearances of a piece of matter, whereas psychology is\\r\\ninterested in certain of these appearances themselves. confining\\r\\nourselves for the moment to the psychology of perceptions, we observe\\r\\nthat perceptions are certain of the appearances of physical objects.\\r\\nfrom the point of view that we have been hitherto adopting, we\\r\\nmight define them as the appearances of objects at places from which\\r\\nsense-organs and the suitable parts of the nervous system form part\\r\\nof the intervening medium. just as a photographic plate receives a\\r\\ndifferent impression of a cluster of stars when a telescope is part of\\r\\nthe intervening medium, so a brain receives a different impression\\r\\nwhen an eye and an optic nerve are part of the intervening medium.\\r\\nan impression due to this sort of intervening medium is called a\\r\\nperception, and is interesting to psychology on its own account, not\\r\\nmerely as one of the set of correlated particulars which is the physical\\r\\nobject of which (as we say) we are having a perception.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe spoke earlier of two ways of classifying particulars. one way\\r\\ncollects together the appearances commonly regarded as a given object\\r\\nfrom different places; this is, broadly speaking, the way of physics,\\r\\nleading to the construction of physical objects as sets of such\\r\\nappearances. the other way collects together the appearances of\\r\\ndifferent objects from a given place, the result being what we call a\\r\\nperspective. in the particular case where the place concerned is a\\r\\nhuman brain, the perspective belonging to the place consists of all the\\r\\nperceptions of a certain man at a given time. thus classification by\\r\\nperspectives is relevant to psychology, and is essential in defining\\r\\nwhat we mean by one mind.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not wish to suggest that the way in which i have been defining\\r\\nperceptions is the only possible way, or even the best way. it is the\\r\\nway that arose naturally out of our present topic. but when we approach\\r\\npsychology from a more introspective standpoint, we have to distinguish\\r\\nsensations and perceptions, if possible, from other mental occurrences,\\r\\nif any. we have also to consider the psychological effects of\\r\\nsensations, as opposed to their physical causes and correlates. these\\r\\nproblems are quite distinct from those with which we have been concerned\\r\\nin the present lecture, and i shall not deal with them until a later\\r\\nstage.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is clear that psychology is concerned essentially with actual\\r\\nparticulars, not merely with systems of particulars. in this it differs\\r\\nfrom physics, which, broadly speaking, is concerned with the cases\\r\\nin which all the particulars which make up one physical object can be\\r\\ntreated as a single causal unit, or rather the particulars which are\\r\\nsufficiently near to the object of which they are appearances can be so\\r\\ntreated. the laws which physics seeks can, broadly speaking, be stated\\r\\nby treating such systems of particulars as causal units. the laws which\\r\\npsychology seeks cannot be so stated, since the particulars themselves\\r\\nare what interests the psychologist. this is one of the fundamental\\r\\ndifferences between physics and psychology; and to make it clear has\\r\\nbeen the main purpose of this lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will conclude with an attempt to give a more precise definition of\\r\\na piece of matter. the appearances of a piece of matter from different\\r\\nplaces change partly according to intrinsic laws (the laws of\\r\\nperspective, in the case of visual shape), partly according to the\\r\\nnature of the intervening medium--fog, blue spectacles, telescopes,\\r\\nmicroscopes, sense-organs, etc. as we approach nearer to the object, the\\r\\neffect of the intervening medium grows less. in a generalized sense,\\r\\nall the intrinsic laws of change of appearance may be called \"laws\\r\\nof perspective.\" given any appearance of an object, we can construct\\r\\nhypothetically a certain system of appearances to which the appearance\\r\\nin question would belong if the laws of perspective alone were\\r\\nconcerned. if we construct this hypothetical system for each appearance\\r\\nof the object in turn, the system corresponding to a given appearance\\r\\nx will be independent of any distortion due to the medium beyond x, and\\r\\nwill only embody such distortion as is due to the medium between x and\\r\\nthe object. thus, as the appearance by which our hypothetical system\\r\\nis defined is moved nearer and nearer to the object, the hypothetical\\r\\nsystem of appearances defined by its means embodies less and less of the\\r\\neffect of the medium. the different sets of appearances resulting from\\r\\nmoving x nearer and nearer to the object will approach to a limiting\\r\\nset, and this limiting set will be that system of appearances which the\\r\\nobject would present if the laws of perspective alone were operative\\r\\nand the medium exercised no distorting effect. this limiting set of\\r\\nappearances may be defined, for purposes of physics, as the piece of\\r\\nmatter concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture vi. introspection\\r\\n\\r\\none of the main purposes of these lectures is to give grounds for\\r\\nthe belief that the distinction between mind and matter is not so\\r\\nfundamental as is commonly supposed. in the preceding lecture i dealt in\\r\\noutline with the physical side of this problem. i attempted to show\\r\\nthat what we call a material object is not itself a substance, but is\\r\\na system of particulars analogous in their nature to sensations, and in\\r\\nfact often including actual sensations among their number. in this\\r\\nway the stuff of which physical objects are composed is brought into\\r\\nrelation with the stuff of which part, at least, of our mental life is\\r\\ncomposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, a converse task which is equally necessary for our\\r\\nthesis, and that is, to show that the stuff of our mental life is devoid\\r\\nof many qualities which it is commonly supposed to have, and is not\\r\\npossessed of any attributes which make it incapable of forming part of\\r\\nthe world of matter. in the present lecture i shall begin the arguments\\r\\nfor this view.\\r\\n\\r\\ncorresponding to the supposed duality of matter and mind, there are, in\\r\\northodox psychology, two ways of knowing what exists. one of these, the\\r\\nway of sensation and external perception, is supposed to furnish data\\r\\nfor our knowledge of matter, the other, called \"introspection,\" is\\r\\nsupposed to furnish data for knowledge of our mental processes. to\\r\\ncommon sense, this distinction seems clear and easy. when you see a\\r\\nfriend coming along the street, you acquire knowledge of an external,\\r\\nphysical fact; when you realize that you are glad to meet him, you\\r\\nacquire knowledge of a mental fact. your dreams and memories and\\r\\nthoughts, of which you are often conscious, are mental facts, and the\\r\\nprocess by which you become aware of them seems to be different from\\r\\nsensation. kant calls it the \"inner sense\"; sometimes it is spoken of\\r\\nas \"consciousness of self\"; but its commonest name in modern english\\r\\npsychology is \"introspection.\" it is this supposed method of acquiring\\r\\nknowledge of our mental processes that i wish to analyse and examine in\\r\\nthis lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will state at the outset the view which i shall aim at establishing.\\r\\ni believe that the stuff of our mental life, as opposed to its relations\\r\\nand structure, consists wholly of sensations and images. sensations are\\r\\nconnected with matter in the way that i tried to explain in lecture v,\\r\\ni.e. each is a member of a system which is a certain physical object.\\r\\nimages, though they usually have certain characteristics, especially\\r\\nlack of vividness, that distinguish them from sensations, are not\\r\\ninvariably so distinguished, and cannot therefore be defined by these\\r\\ncharacteristics. images, as opposed to sensations, can only be defined\\r\\nby their different causation: they are caused by association with a\\r\\nsensation, not by a stimulus external to the nervous system--or perhaps\\r\\none should say external to the brain, where the higher animals are\\r\\nconcerned. the occurrence of a sensation or image does not in itself\\r\\nconstitute knowledge but any sensation or image may come to be known\\r\\nif the conditions are suitable. when a sensation--like the hearing of a\\r\\nclap of thunder--is normally correlated with closely similar sensations\\r\\nin our neighbours, we regard it as giving knowledge of the external\\r\\nworld, since we regard the whole set of similar sensations as due to\\r\\na common external cause. but images and bodily sensations are not so\\r\\ncorrelated. bodily sensations can be brought into a correlation by\\r\\nphysiology, and thus take their place ultimately among sources of\\r\\nknowledge of the physical world. but images cannot be made to fit in\\r\\nwith the simultaneous sensations and images of others. apart from their\\r\\nhypothetical causes in the brain, they have a causal connection\\r\\nwith physical objects, through the fact that they are copies of past\\r\\nsensations; but the physical objects with which they are thus connected\\r\\nare in the past, not in the present. these images remain private in\\r\\na sense in which sensations are not. a sensation seems to give us\\r\\nknowledge of a present physical object, while an image does not, except\\r\\nwhen it amounts to a hallucination, and in this case the seeming is\\r\\ndeceptive. thus the whole context of the two occurrences is different.\\r\\nbut in themselves they do not differ profoundly, and there is no reason\\r\\nto invoke two different ways of knowing for the one and for the other.\\r\\nconsequently introspection as a separate kind of knowledge disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe criticism of introspection has been in the main the work of american\\r\\npsychologists. i will begin by summarizing an article which seems to me\\r\\nto afford a good specimen of their arguments, namely, \"the case against\\r\\nintrospection,\" by knight dunlap (\"psychological review,\" vol xix, no.\\r\\n5, pp. 404-413, september, 1912). after a few historical quotations,\\r\\nhe comes to two modern defenders of introspection, stout and james. he\\r\\nquotes from stout such statements as the following: \"psychical states as\\r\\nsuch become objects only when we attend to them in an introspective way.\\r\\notherwise they are not themselves objects, but only constituents of the\\r\\nprocess by which objects are recognized\" (\"manual,\" 2nd edition, p. 134.\\r\\nthe word \"recognized\" in dunlap\\'s quotation should be \"cognized.\") \"the\\r\\nobject itself can never be identified with the present modification of\\r\\nthe individual\\'s consciousness by which it is cognized\" (ib. p. 60).\\r\\nthis is to be true even when we are thinking about modifications of\\r\\nour own consciousness; such modifications are to be always at least\\r\\npartially distinct from the conscious experience in which we think of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nat this point i wish to interrupt the account of knight dunlap\\'s article\\r\\nin order to make some observations on my own account with reference to\\r\\nthe above quotations from stout. in the first place, the conception of\\r\\n\"psychical states\" seems to me one which demands analysis of a somewhat\\r\\ndestructive character. this analysis i shall give in later lectures as\\r\\nregards cognition; i have already given it as regards desire. in the\\r\\nsecond place, the conception of \"objects\" depends upon a certain view\\r\\nas to cognition which i believe to be wholly mistaken, namely, the view\\r\\nwhich i discussed in my first lecture in connection with brentano.\\r\\nin this view a single cognitive occurrence contains both content and\\r\\nobject, the content being essentially mental, while the object is\\r\\nphysical except in introspection and abstract thought. i have already\\r\\ncriticized this view, and will not dwell upon it now, beyond saying\\r\\nthat \"the process by which objects are cognized\" appears to be a very\\r\\nslippery phrase. when we \"see a table,\" as common sense would say, the\\r\\ntable as a physical object is not the \"object\" (in the psychological\\r\\nsense) of our perception. our perception is made up of sensations,\\r\\nimages and beliefs, but the supposed \"object\" is something inferential,\\r\\nexternally related, not logically bound up with what is occurring in us.\\r\\nthis question of the nature of the object also affects the view we take\\r\\nof self-consciousness. obviously, a \"conscious experience\" is different\\r\\nfrom a physical object; therefore it is natural to assume that a thought\\r\\nor perception whose object is a conscious experience must be different\\r\\nfrom a thought or perception whose object is a physical object. but if\\r\\nthe relation to the object is inferential and external, as i maintain,\\r\\nthe difference between two thoughts may bear very little relation to\\r\\nthe difference between their objects. and to speak of \"the present\\r\\nmodification of the individual\\'s consciousness by which an object is\\r\\ncognized\" is to suggest that the cognition of objects is a far more\\r\\ndirect process, far more intimately bound up with the objects, than i\\r\\nbelieve it to be. all these points will be amplified when we come to the\\r\\nanalysis of knowledge, but it is necessary briefly to state them now in\\r\\norder to suggest the atmosphere in which our analysis of \"introspection\"\\r\\nis to be carried on.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother point in which stout\\'s remarks seem to me to suggest what i\\r\\nregard as mistakes is his use of \"consciousness.\" there is a view which\\r\\nis prevalent among psychologists, to the effect that one can speak of \"a\\r\\nconscious experience\" in a curious dual sense, meaning, on the one hand,\\r\\nan experience which is conscious of something, and, on the other hand,\\r\\nan experience which has some intrinsic nature characteristic of what\\r\\nis called \"consciousness.\" that is to say, a \"conscious experience\" is\\r\\ncharacterized on the one hand by relation to its object and on the\\r\\nother hand by being composed of a certain peculiar stuff, the stuff of\\r\\n\"consciousness.\" and in many authors there is yet a third confusion: a\\r\\n\"conscious experience,\" in this third sense, is an experience of\\r\\nwhich we are conscious. all these, it seems to me, need to be clearly\\r\\nseparated. to say that one occurrence is \"conscious\" of another is, to\\r\\nmy mind, to assert an external and rather remote relation between them.\\r\\ni might illustrate it by the relation of uncle and nephew a man becomes\\r\\nan uncle through no effort of his own, merely through an occurrence\\r\\nelsewhere. similarly, when you are said to be \"conscious\" of a table,\\r\\nthe question whether this is really the case cannot be decided by\\r\\nexamining only your state of mind: it is necessary also to ascertain\\r\\nwhether your sensation is having those correlates which past experience\\r\\ncauses you to assume, or whether the table happens, in this case, to be\\r\\na mirage. and, as i explained in my first lecture, i do not believe that\\r\\nthere is any \"stuff\" of consciousness, so that there is no intrinsic\\r\\ncharacter by which a \"conscious\" experience could be distinguished from\\r\\nany other.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter these preliminaries, we can return to knight dunlap\\'s article.\\r\\nhis criticism of stout turns on the difficulty of giving any empirical\\r\\nmeaning to such notions as the \"mind\" or the \"subject\"; he quotes from\\r\\nstout the sentence: \"the most important drawback is that the mind, in\\r\\nwatching its own workings, must necessarily have its attention divided\\r\\nbetween two objects,\" and he concludes: \"without question, stout is\\r\\nbringing in here illicitly the concept of a single observer, and his\\r\\nintrospection does not provide for the observation of this observer;\\r\\nfor the process observed and the observer are distinct\" (p. 407).\\r\\nthe objections to any theory which brings in the single observer were\\r\\nconsidered in lecture i, and were acknowledged to be cogent. in so\\r\\nfar, therefore, as stout\\'s theory of introspection rests upon this\\r\\nassumption, we are compelled to reject it. but it is perfectly possible\\r\\nto believe in introspection without supposing that there is a single\\r\\nobserver.\\r\\n\\r\\nwilliam james\\'s theory of introspection, which dunlap next examines,\\r\\ndoes not assume a single observer. it changed after the publication\\r\\nof his \"psychology,\" in consequence of his abandoning the dualism of\\r\\nthought and things. dunlap summarizes his theory as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the essential points in james\\'s scheme of consciousness are subject,\\r\\nobject, and a knowing of the object by the subject. the difference\\r\\nbetween james\\'s scheme and other schemes involving the same terms is\\r\\nthat james considers subject and object to be the same thing, but at\\r\\ndifferent times in order to satisfy this requirement james supposes a\\r\\nrealm of existence which he at first called \\'states of consciousness\\' or\\r\\n\\'thoughts,\\' and later, \\'pure experience,\\' the latter term including both\\r\\nthe \\'thoughts\\' and the \\'knowing.\\' this scheme, with all its magnificent\\r\\nartificiality, james held on to until the end, simply dropping the\\r\\nterm consciousness and the dualism between the thought and an external\\r\\nreality\"(p. 409).\\r\\n\\r\\nhe adds: \"all that james\\'s system really amounts to is the\\r\\nacknowledgment that a succession of things are known, and that they are\\r\\nknown by something. this is all any one can claim, except for the\\r\\nfact that the things are known together, and that the knower for the\\r\\ndifferent items is one and the same\" (ib.).\\r\\n\\r\\nin this statement, to my mind, dunlap concedes far more than james did\\r\\nin his later theory. i see no reason to suppose that \"the knower for\\r\\ndifferent items is one and the same,\" and i am convinced that this\\r\\nproposition could not possibly be ascertained except by introspection of\\r\\nthe sort that dunlap rejects. the first of these points must wait until\\r\\nwe come to the analysis of belief: the second must be considered now.\\r\\ndunlap\\'s view is that there is a dualism of subject and object, but that\\r\\nthe subject can never become object, and therefore there is no awareness\\r\\nof an awareness. he says in discussing the view that introspection\\r\\nreveals the occurrence of knowledge: \"there can be no denial of the\\r\\nexistence of the thing (knowing) which is alleged to be known or\\r\\nobserved in this sort of \\'introspection.\\' the allegation that the\\r\\nknowing is observed is that which may be denied. knowing there certainly\\r\\nis; known, the knowing certainly is not\"(p. 410). and again: \"i am\\r\\nnever aware of an awareness\" (ib.). and on the next page: \"it may sound\\r\\nparadoxical to say that one cannot observe the process (or relation) of\\r\\nobservation, and yet may be certain that there is such a process: but\\r\\nthere is really no inconsistency in the saying. how do i know that there\\r\\nis awareness? by being aware of something. there is no meaning in the\\r\\nterm \\'awareness\\' which is not expressed in the statement \\'i am aware of\\r\\na colour (or what-not).\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the paradox cannot be so lightly disposed of. the statement \"i am\\r\\naware of a colour\" is assumed by knight dunlap to be known to be true,\\r\\nbut he does not explain how it comes to be known. the argument against\\r\\nhim is not conclusive, since he may be able to show some valid way of\\r\\ninferring our awareness. but he does not suggest any such way. there is\\r\\nnothing odd in the hypothesis of beings which are aware of objects, but\\r\\nnot of their own awareness; it is, indeed, highly probable that young\\r\\nchildren and the higher animals are such beings. but such beings cannot\\r\\nmake the statement \"i am aware of a colour,\" which we can make. we have,\\r\\ntherefore, some knowledge which they lack. it is necessary to knight\\r\\ndunlap\\'s position to maintain that this additional knowledge is purely\\r\\ninferential, but he makes no attempt to show how the inference is\\r\\npossible. it may, of course, be possible, but i cannot see how. to my\\r\\nmind the fact (which he admits) that we know there is awareness, is all\\r\\nbut decisive against his theory, and in favour of the view that we can\\r\\nbe aware of an awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\ndunlap asserts (to return to james) that the real ground for james\\'s\\r\\noriginal belief in introspection was his belief in two sorts of\\r\\nobjects, namely, thoughts and things. he suggests that it was a\\r\\nmere inconsistency on james\\'s part to adhere to introspection after\\r\\nabandoning the dualism of thoughts and things. i do not wholly agree\\r\\nwith this view, but it is difficult to disentangle the difference as to\\r\\nintrospection from the difference as to the nature of knowing. dunlap\\r\\nsuggests (p. 411) that what is called introspection really consists of\\r\\nawareness of \"images,\" visceral sensations, and so on. this view, in\\r\\nessence, seems to me sound. but then i hold that knowing itself consists\\r\\nof such constituents suitably related, and that in being aware of them\\r\\nwe are sometimes being aware of instances of knowing. for this reason,\\r\\nmuch as i agree with his view as to what are the objects of which\\r\\nthere is awareness, i cannot wholly agree with his conclusion as to the\\r\\nimpossibility of introspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe behaviourists have challenged introspection even more vigorously\\r\\nthan knight dunlap, and have gone so far as to deny the existence of\\r\\nimages. but i think that they have confused various things which\\r\\nare very commonly confused, and that it is necessary to make several\\r\\ndistinctions before we can arrive at what is true and what false in the\\r\\ncriticism of introspection.\\r\\n\\r\\ni wish to distinguish three distinct questions, any one of which may be\\r\\nmeant when we ask whether introspection is a source of knowledge. the\\r\\nthree questions are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) can we observe anything about ourselves which we cannot observe\\r\\nabout other people, or is everything we can observe public, in the sense\\r\\nthat another could also observe it if suitably placed?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) does everything that we can observe obey the laws of physics and\\r\\nform part of the physical world, or can we observe certain things that\\r\\nlie outside physics?\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) can we observe anything which differs in its intrinsic nature from\\r\\nthe constituents of the physical world, or is everything that we can\\r\\nobserve composed of elements intrinsically similar to the constituents\\r\\nof what is called matter?\\r\\n\\r\\nany one of these three questions may be used to define introspection. i\\r\\nshould favour introspection in the sense of the first question, i.e. i\\r\\nthink that some of the things we observe cannot, even theoretically, be\\r\\nobserved by any one else. the second question, tentatively and for\\r\\nthe present, i should answer in favour of introspection; i think that\\r\\nimages, in the actual condition of science, cannot be brought under the\\r\\ncausal laws of physics, though perhaps ultimately they may be. the\\r\\nthird question i should answer adversely to introspection i think that\\r\\nobservation shows us nothing that is not composed of sensations and\\r\\nimages, and that images differ from sensations in their causal laws, not\\r\\nintrinsically. i shall deal with the three questions successively.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) publicity or privacy of what is observed. confining ourselves, for\\r\\nthe moment, to sensations, we find that there are different degrees\\r\\nof publicity attaching to different sorts of sensations. if you feel a\\r\\ntoothache when the other people in the room do not, you are in no way\\r\\nsurprised; but if you hear a clap of thunder when they do not, you begin\\r\\nto be alarmed as to your mental condition. sight and hearing are the\\r\\nmost public of the senses; smell only a trifle less so; touch, again, a\\r\\ntrifle less, since two people can only touch the same spot successively,\\r\\nnot simultaneously. taste has a sort of semi-publicity, since people\\r\\nseem to experience similar taste-sensations when they eat similar foods;\\r\\nbut the publicity is incomplete, since two people cannot eat actually\\r\\nthe same piece of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut when we pass on to bodily sensations--headache, toothache, hunger,\\r\\nthirst, the feeling of fatigue, and so on--we get quite away from\\r\\npublicity, into a region where other people can tell us what they feel,\\r\\nbut we cannot directly observe their feeling. as a natural result of\\r\\nthis state of affairs, it has come to be thought that the public senses\\r\\ngive us knowledge of the outer world, while the private senses only give\\r\\nus knowledge as to our own bodies. as regards privacy, all images, of\\r\\nwhatever sort, belong with the sensations which only give knowledge of\\r\\nour own bodies, i.e. each is only observable by one observer. this is\\r\\nthe reason why images of sight and hearing are more obviously different\\r\\nfrom sensations of sight and hearing than images of bodily sensations\\r\\nare from bodily sensations; and that is why the argument in favour of\\r\\nimages is more conclusive in such cases as sight and hearing than in\\r\\nsuch cases as inner speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole distinction of privacy and publicity, however, so long as we\\r\\nconfine ourselves to sensations, is one of degree, not of kind. no\\r\\ntwo people, there is good empirical reason to think, ever have exactly\\r\\nsimilar sensations related to the same physical object at the same\\r\\nmoment; on the other hand, even the most private sensation has\\r\\ncorrelations which would theoretically enable another observer to infer\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat no sensation is ever completely public, results from differences of\\r\\npoint of view. two people looking at the same table do not get the same\\r\\nsensation, because of perspective and the way the light falls. they get\\r\\nonly correlated sensations. two people listening to the same sound do\\r\\nnot hear exactly the same thing, because one is nearer to the source of\\r\\nthe sound than the other, one has better hearing than the other, and\\r\\nso on. thus publicity in sensations consists, not in having precisely\\r\\nsimilar sensations, but in having more or less similar sensations\\r\\ncorrelated according to ascertainable laws. the sensations which strike\\r\\nus as public are those where the correlated sensations are very similar\\r\\nand the correlations are very easy to discover. but even the most\\r\\nprivate sensations have correlations with things that others can\\r\\nobserve. the dentist does not observe your ache, but he can see the\\r\\ncavity which causes it, and could guess that you are suffering even\\r\\nif you did not tell him. this fact, however, cannot be used, as watson\\r\\nwould apparently wish, to extrude from science observations which are\\r\\nprivate to one observer, since it is by means of many such observations\\r\\nthat correlations are established, e.g. between toothaches and cavities.\\r\\nprivacy, therefore does not by itself make a datum unamenable to\\r\\nscientific treatment. on this point, the argument against introspection\\r\\nmust be rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) does everything observable obey the laws of physics? we come now to\\r\\nthe second ground of objection to introspection, namely, that its data\\r\\ndo not obey the laws of physics. this, though less emphasized, is,\\r\\ni think, an objection which is really more strongly felt than the\\r\\nobjection of privacy. and we obtain a definition of introspection more\\r\\nin harmony with usage if we define it as observation of data not subject\\r\\nto physical laws than if we define it by means of privacy. no one would\\r\\nregard a man as introspective because he was conscious of having a\\r\\nstomach ache. opponents of introspection do not mean to deny the obvious\\r\\nfact that we can observe bodily sensations which others cannot observe.\\r\\nfor example, knight dunlap contends that images are really muscular\\r\\ncontractions,* and evidently regards our awareness of muscular\\r\\ncontractions as not coming under the head of introspection. i think it\\r\\nwill be found that the essential characteristic of introspective data,\\r\\nin the sense which now concerns us, has to do with localization: either\\r\\nthey are not localized at all, or they are localized, like visual\\r\\nimages, in a place already physically occupied by something which would\\r\\nbe inconsistent with them if they were regarded as part of the physical\\r\\nworld. if you have a visual image of your friend sitting in a chair\\r\\nwhich in fact is empty, you cannot locate the image in your body,\\r\\nbecause it is visual, nor (as a physical phenomenon) in the chair,\\r\\nbecause the chair, as a physical object, is empty. thus it seems to\\r\\nfollow that the physical world does not include all that we are aware\\r\\nof, and that images, which are introspective data, have to be regarded,\\r\\nfor the present, as not obeying the laws of physics; this is, i think,\\r\\none of the chief reasons why an attempt is made to reject them. i\\r\\nshall try to show in lecture viii that the purely empirical reasons for\\r\\naccepting images are overwhelming. but we cannot be nearly so certain\\r\\nthat they will not ultimately be brought under the laws of physics. even\\r\\nif this should happen, however, they would still be distinguishable\\r\\nfrom sensations by their proximate causal laws, as gases remain\\r\\ndistinguishable from solids.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"psychological review,\" 1916, \"thought-content and\\r\\n     feeling,\" p. 59. see also ib., 1912, \"the nature of\\r\\n     perceived relations,\" where he says: \"\\'introspection,\\'\\r\\n     divested of its mythological suggestion of the observing of\\r\\n     consciousness, is really the observation of bodily\\r\\n     sensations (sensibles) and feelings (feelables)\"(p. 427 n.).\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) can we observe anything intrinsically different from sensations? we\\r\\ncome now to our third question concerning introspection. it is commonly\\r\\nthought that by looking within we can observe all sorts of things that\\r\\nare radically different from the constituents of the physical world,\\r\\ne.g. thoughts, beliefs, desires, pleasures, pains and emotions. the\\r\\ndifference between mind and matter is increased partly by emphasizing\\r\\nthese supposed introspective data, partly by the supposition that matter\\r\\nis composed of atoms or electrons or whatever units physics may at the\\r\\nmoment prefer. as against this latter supposition, i contend that\\r\\nthe ultimate constituents of matter are not atoms or electrons, but\\r\\nsensations, and other things similar to sensations as regards extent and\\r\\nduration. as against the view that introspection reveals a mental world\\r\\nradically different from sensations, i propose to argue that thoughts,\\r\\nbeliefs, desires, pleasures, pains and emotions are all built up out\\r\\nof sensations and images alone, and that there is reason to think that\\r\\nimages do not differ from sensations in their intrinsic character. we\\r\\nthus effect a mutual rapprochement of mind and matter, and reduce the\\r\\nultimate data of introspection (in our second sense) to images alone. on\\r\\nthis third view of the meaning of introspection, therefore, our decision\\r\\nis wholly against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere remain two points to be considered concerning introspection. the\\r\\nfirst is as to how far it is trustworthy; the second is as to whether,\\r\\neven granting that it reveals no radically different stuff from that\\r\\nrevealed by what might be called external perception, it may not reveal\\r\\ndifferent relations, and thus acquire almost as much importance as is\\r\\ntraditionally assigned to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nto begin with the trustworthiness of introspection. it is common among\\r\\ncertain schools to regard the knowledge of our own mental processes as\\r\\nincomparably more certain than our knowledge of the \"external\" world;\\r\\nthis view is to be found in the british philosophy which descends from\\r\\nhume, and is present, somewhat veiled, in kant and his followers.\\r\\nthere seems no reason whatever to accept this view. our spontaneous,\\r\\nunsophisticated beliefs, whether as to ourselves or as to the outer\\r\\nworld, are always extremely rash and very liable to error. the\\r\\nacquisition of caution is equally necessary and equally difficult in\\r\\nboth directions. not only are we often un aware of entertaining a\\r\\nbelief or desire which exists in us; we are often actually mistaken. the\\r\\nfallibility of introspection as regards what we desire is made evident\\r\\nby psycho-analysis; its fallibility as to what we know is easily\\r\\ndemonstrated. an autobiography, when confronted by a careful editor\\r\\nwith documentary evidence, is usually found to be full of obviously\\r\\ninadvertent errors. any of us confronted by a forgotten letter written\\r\\nsome years ago will be astonished to find how much more foolish our\\r\\nopinions were than we had remembered them as being. and as to the\\r\\nanalysis of our mental operations--believing, desiring, willing, or what\\r\\nnot--introspection unaided gives very little help: it is necessary to\\r\\nconstruct hypotheses and test them by their consequences, just as we do\\r\\nin physical science. introspection, therefore, though it is one among\\r\\nour sources of knowledge, is not, in isolation, in any degree more\\r\\ntrustworthy than \"external\" perception.\\r\\n\\r\\ni come now to our second question: does introspection give us materials\\r\\nfor the knowledge of relations other than those arrived at by reflecting\\r\\nupon external perception? it might be contended that the essence of what\\r\\nis \"mental\" consists of relations, such as knowing for example, and that\\r\\nour knowledge concerning these essentially mental relations is entirely\\r\\nderived from introspection. if \"knowing\" were an unanalysable relation,\\r\\nthis view would be incontrovertible, since clearly no such relation\\r\\nforms part of the subject matter of physics. but it would seem that\\r\\n\"knowing\" is really various relations, all of them complex. therefore,\\r\\nuntil they have been analysed, our present question must remain\\r\\nunanswered i shall return to it at the end of the present course of\\r\\nlectures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture vii. the definition of perception\\r\\n\\r\\nin lecture v we found reason to think that the ultimate constituents*\\r\\nof the world do not have the characteristics of either mind or matter\\r\\nas ordinarily understood: they are not solid persistent objects moving\\r\\nthrough space, nor are they fragments of \"consciousness.\" but we found\\r\\ntwo ways of grouping particulars, one into \"things\" or \"pieces of\\r\\nmatter,\" the other into series of \"perspectives,\" each series being what\\r\\nmay be called a \"biography.\" before we can define either sensations\\r\\nor images, it is necessary to consider this twofold classification\\r\\nin somewhat greater detail, and to derive from it a definition of\\r\\nperception. it should be said that, in so far as the classification\\r\\nassumes the whole world of physics (including its unperceived portions),\\r\\nit contains hypothetical elements. but we will not linger on the grounds\\r\\nfor admitting these, which belong to the philosophy of physics rather\\r\\nthan of psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * when i speak of \"ultimate constituents,\" i do not mean\\r\\n     necessarily such as are theoretically incapable of analysis,\\r\\n     but only such as, at present, we can see no means of\\r\\n     analysing. i speak of such constituents as \"particulars,\" or\\r\\n     as \"relative particulars\" when i wish to emphasize the fact\\r\\n     that they may be themselves complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe physical classification of particulars collects together all those\\r\\nthat are aspects of one \"thing.\" given any one particular, it is\\r\\nfound often (we do not say always) that there are a number of other\\r\\nparticulars differing from this one in gradually increasing degrees.\\r\\nthose (or some of those) that differ from it only very slightly will\\r\\nbe found to differ approximately according to certain laws which may be\\r\\ncalled, in a generalized sense, the laws of \"perspective\"; they include\\r\\nthe ordinary laws of perspective as a special case. this approximation\\r\\ngrows more and more nearly exact as the difference grows less; in\\r\\ntechnical language, the laws of perspective account for the differences\\r\\nto the first order of small quantities, and other laws are only\\r\\nrequired to account for second-order differences. that is to say, as the\\r\\ndifference diminishes, the part of the difference which is not according\\r\\nto the laws of perspective diminishes much more rapidly, and bears to\\r\\nthe total difference a ratio which tends towards zero as both are made\\r\\nsmaller and smaller. by this means we can theoretically collect together\\r\\na number of particulars which may be defined as the \"aspects\" or\\r\\n\"appearances\" of one thing at one time. if the laws of perspective were\\r\\nsufficiently known, the connection between different aspects would be\\r\\nexpressed in differential equations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis gives us, so far, only those particulars which constitute one thing\\r\\nat one time. this set of particulars may be called a \"momentary\\r\\nthing.\" to define that series of \"momentary things\" that constitute\\r\\nthe successive states of one thing is a problem involving the laws of\\r\\ndynamics. these give the laws governing the changes of aspects from\\r\\none time to a slightly later time, with the same sort of differential\\r\\napproximation to exactness as we obtained for spatially neighbouring\\r\\naspects through the laws of perspective. thus a momentary thing is a set\\r\\nof particulars, while a thing (which may be identified with the whole\\r\\nhistory of the thing) is a series of such sets of particulars.\\r\\nthe particulars in one set are collected together by the laws of\\r\\nperspective; the successive sets are collected together by the laws\\r\\nof dynamics. this is the view of the world which is appropriate to\\r\\ntraditional physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe definition of a \"momentary thing\" involves problems concerning time,\\r\\nsince the particulars constituting a momentary thing will not be all\\r\\nsimultaneous, but will travel outward from the thing with the velocity\\r\\nof light (in case the thing is in vacuo). there are complications\\r\\nconnected with relativity, but for our present purpose they are not\\r\\nvital, and i shall ignore them.\\r\\n\\r\\ninstead of first collecting together all the particulars constituting\\r\\na momentary thing, and then forming the series of successive sets,\\r\\nwe might have first collected together a series of successive aspects\\r\\nrelated by the laws of dynamics, and then have formed the set of such\\r\\nseries related by the laws of perspective. to illustrate by the case of\\r\\nan actor on the stage: our first plan was to collect together all the\\r\\naspects which he presents to different spectators at one time, and then\\r\\nto form the series of such sets. our second plan is first to collect\\r\\ntogether all the aspects which he presents successively to a given\\r\\nspectator, and then to do the same thing for the other spectators, thus\\r\\nforming a set of series instead of a series of sets. the first plan\\r\\ntells us what he does; the second the impressions he produces. this\\r\\nsecond way of classifying particulars is one which obviously has more\\r\\nrelevance to psychology than the other. it is partly by this second\\r\\nmethod of classification that we obtain definitions of one \"experience\"\\r\\nor \"biography\" or \"person.\" this method of classification is also\\r\\nessential to the definition of sensations and images, as i shall\\r\\nendeavour to prove later on. but we must first amplify the definition of\\r\\nperspectives and biographies.\\r\\n\\r\\nin our illustration of the actor, we spoke, for the moment, as though\\r\\neach spectator\\'s mind were wholly occupied by the one actor. if this\\r\\nwere the case, it might be possible to define the biography of one\\r\\nspectator as a series of successive aspects of the actor related\\r\\naccording to the laws of dynamics. but in fact this is not the case.\\r\\nwe are at all times during our waking life receiving a variety of\\r\\nimpressions, which are aspects of a variety of things. we have to\\r\\nconsider what binds together two simultaneous sensations in one\\r\\nperson, or, more generally, any two occurrences which forte part of one\\r\\nexperience. we might say, adhering to the standpoint of physics, that\\r\\ntwo aspects of different things belong to the same perspective when\\r\\nthey are in the same place. but this would not really help us, since a\\r\\n\"place\" has not yet been defined. can we define what is meant by saying\\r\\nthat two aspects are \"in the same place,\" without introducing anything\\r\\nbeyond the laws of perspective and dynamics?\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not feel sure whether it is possible to frame such a definition or\\r\\nnot; accordingly i shall not assume that it is possible, but shall\\r\\nseek other characteristics by which a perspective or biography may be\\r\\ndefined.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen (for example) we see one man and hear another speaking at the\\r\\nsame time, what we see and what we hear have a relation which we\\r\\ncan perceive, which makes the two together form, in some sense, one\\r\\nexperience. it is when this relation exists that two occurrences become\\r\\nassociated. semon\\'s \"engram\" is formed by all that we experience at one\\r\\ntime. he speaks of two parts of this total as having the relation of\\r\\n\"nebeneinander\" (m. 118; m.e. 33 ff.), which is reminiscent of herbart\\'s\\r\\n\"zusammen.\" i think the relation may be called simply \"simultaneity.\" it\\r\\nmight be said that at any moment all sorts of things that are not part\\r\\nof my experience are happening in the world, and that therefore the\\r\\nrelation we are seeking to define cannot be merely simultaneity.\\r\\nthis, however, would be an error--the sort of error that the theory\\r\\nof relativity avoids. there is not one universal time, except by an\\r\\nelaborate construction; there are only local times, each of which may\\r\\nbe taken to be the time within one biography. accordingly, if i am (say)\\r\\nhearing a sound, the only occurrences that are, in any simple sense,\\r\\nsimultaneous with my sensation are events in my private world, i.e. in\\r\\nmy biography. we may therefore define the \"perspective\" to which\\r\\nthe sensation in question belongs as the set of particulars that are\\r\\nsimultaneous with this sensation. and similarly we may define the\\r\\n\"biography\" to which the sensation belongs as the set of particulars\\r\\nthat are earlier or later than, or simultaneous with, the given\\r\\nsensation. moreover, the very same definitions can be applied to\\r\\nparticulars which are not sensations. they are actually required for the\\r\\ntheory of relativity, if we are to give a philosophical explanation\\r\\nof what is meant by \"local time\" in that theory the relations of\\r\\nsimultaneity and succession are known to us in our own experience;\\r\\nthey may be analysable, but that does not affect their suitability for\\r\\ndefining perspectives and biographies. such time-relations as can be\\r\\nconstructed between events in different biographies are of a different\\r\\nkind: they are not experienced, and are merely logical, being designed\\r\\nto afford convenient ways of stating the correlations between different\\r\\nbiographies.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not only by time-relations that the parts of one biography are\\r\\ncollected together in the case of living beings. in this case there are\\r\\nthe mnemic phenomena which constitute the unity of one \"experience,\" and\\r\\ntransform mere occurrences into \"experiences.\" i have already dwelt upon\\r\\nthe importance of mnemic phenomena for psychology, and shall not\\r\\nenlarge upon them now, beyond observing that they are what transforms a\\r\\nbiography (in our technical sense) into a life. it is they that give the\\r\\ncontinuity of a \"person\" or a \"mind.\" but there is no reason to suppose\\r\\nthat mnemic phenomena are associated with biographies except in the case\\r\\nof animals and plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nour two-fold classification of particulars gives rise to the dualism of\\r\\nbody and biography in regard to everything in the universe, and not only\\r\\nin regard to living things. this arises as follows. every particular of\\r\\nthe sort considered by physics is a member of two groups (1) the group\\r\\nof particulars constituting the other aspects of the same physical\\r\\nobject; (2) the group of particulars that have direct time-relations to\\r\\nthe given particular.\\r\\n\\r\\neach of these is associated with a place. when i look at a star, my\\r\\nsensation is (1) a member of the group of particulars which is the star,\\r\\nand which is associated with the place where the star is; (2) a\\r\\nmember of the group of particulars which is my biography, and which is\\r\\nassociated with the place where i am.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     *i have explained elsewhere the manner in which space is\\r\\n     constructed on this theory, and in which the position of a\\r\\n     perspective is brought into relation with the position of a\\r\\n     physical object (\"our knowledge of the external world,\"\\r\\n     lecture iii, pp. 90, 91).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe result is that every particular of the kind relevant to physics is\\r\\nassociated with two places; e.g. my sensation of the star is associated\\r\\nwith the place where i am and with the place where the star is. this\\r\\ndualism has nothing to do with any \"mind\" that i may be supposed to\\r\\npossess; it exists in exactly the same sense if i am replaced by a\\r\\nphotographic plate. we may call the two places the active and passive\\r\\nplaces respectively.* thus in the case of a perception or photograph\\r\\nof a star, the active place is the place where the star is, while the\\r\\npassive place is the place where the percipient or photographic plate\\r\\nis.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * i use these as mere names; i do not want to introduce any\\r\\n     notion of \"activity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can thus, without departing from physics, collect together all the\\r\\nparticulars actively at a given place, or all the particulars passively\\r\\nat a given place. in our own case, the one group is our body (or\\r\\nour brain), while the other is our mind, in so far as it consists of\\r\\nperceptions. in the case of the photographic plate, the first group is\\r\\nthe plate as dealt with by physics, the second the aspect of the heavens\\r\\nwhich it photographs. (for the sake of schematic simplicity, i am\\r\\nignoring various complications connected with time, which require some\\r\\ntedious but perfectly feasible elaborations.) thus what may be called\\r\\nsubjectivity in the point of view is not a distinctive peculiarity of\\r\\nmind: it is present just as much in the photographic plate. and the\\r\\nphotographic plate has its biography as well as its \"matter.\" but\\r\\nthis biography is an affair of physics, and has none of the peculiar\\r\\ncharacteristics by which \"mental\" phenomena are distinguished, with the\\r\\nsole exception of subjectivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nadhering, for the moment, to the standpoint of physics, we may define a\\r\\n\"perception\" of an object as the appearance of the object from a place\\r\\nwhere there is a brain (or, in lower animals, some suitable nervous\\r\\nstructure), with sense-organs and nerves forming part of the intervening\\r\\nmedium. such appearances of objects are distinguished from appearances\\r\\nin other places by certain peculiarities, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) they give rise to mnemic phenomena;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) they are themselves affected by mnemic phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat is to say, they may be remembered and associated or influence our\\r\\nhabits, or give rise to images, etc., and they are themselves different\\r\\nfrom what they would have been if our past experience had been\\r\\ndifferent--for example, the effect of a spoken sentence upon the hearer\\r\\ndepends upon whether the hearer knows the language or not, which is\\r\\na question of past experience. it is these two characteristics, both\\r\\nconnected with mnemic phenomena, that distinguish perceptions from the\\r\\nappearances of objects in places where there is no living being.\\r\\n\\r\\ntheoretically, though often not practically, we can, in our perception\\r\\nof an object, separate the part which is due to past experience from the\\r\\npart which proceeds without mnemic influences out of the character of\\r\\nthe object. we may define as \"sensation\" that part which proceeds in\\r\\nthis way, while the remainder, which is a mnemic phenomenon, will have\\r\\nto be added to the sensation to make up what is called the \"perception.\"\\r\\naccording to this definition, the sensation is a theoretical core in\\r\\nthe actual experience; the actual experience is the perception. it\\r\\nis obvious that there are grave difficulties in carrying out these\\r\\ndefinitions, but we will not linger over them. we have to pass, as soon\\r\\nas we can, from the physical standpoint, which we have been hitherto\\r\\nadopting, to the standpoint of psychology, in which we make more use\\r\\nof introspection in the first of the three senses discussed in the\\r\\npreceding lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut before making the transition, there are two points which must be\\r\\nmade clear. first: everything outside my own personal biography is\\r\\noutside my experience; therefore if anything can be known by me outside\\r\\nmy biography, it can only be known in one of two ways:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) by inference from things within my biography, or\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) by some a priori principle independent of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not myself believe that anything approaching certainty is to be\\r\\nattained by either of these methods, and therefore whatever lies outside\\r\\nmy personal biography must be regarded, theoretically, as hypothesis.\\r\\nthe theoretical argument for adopting the hypothesis is that it\\r\\nsimplifies the statement of the laws according to which events happen\\r\\nin our experience. but there is no very good ground for supposing that\\r\\na simple law is more likely to be true than a complicated law, though\\r\\nthere is good ground for assuming a simple law in scientific practice,\\r\\nas a working hypothesis, if it explains the facts as well as another\\r\\nwhich is less simple. belief in the existence of things outside my own\\r\\nbiography exists antecedently to evidence, and can only be destroyed, if\\r\\nat all, by a long course of philosophic doubt. for purposes of science,\\r\\nit is justified practically by the simplification which it introduces\\r\\ninto the laws of physics. but from the standpoint of theoretical logic\\r\\nit must be regarded as a prejudice, not as a well-grounded theory. with\\r\\nthis proviso, i propose to continue yielding to the prejudice.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second point concerns the relating of our point of view to that\\r\\nwhich regards sensations as caused by stimuli external to the nervous\\r\\nsystem (or at least to the brain), and distinguishes images as\\r\\n\"centrally excited,\" i.e. due to causes in the brain which cannot be\\r\\ntraced back to anything affecting the sense-organs. it is clear that,\\r\\nif our analysis of physical objects has been valid, this way of defining\\r\\nsensations needs reinterpretation. it is also clear that we must be able\\r\\nto find such a new interpretation if our theory is to be admissible.\\r\\n\\r\\nto make the matter clear, we will take the simplest possible\\r\\nillustration. consider a certain star, and suppose for the moment\\r\\nthat its size is negligible. that is to say, we will regard it as, for\\r\\npractical purposes, a luminous point. let us further suppose that it\\r\\nexists only for a very brief time, say a second. then, according to\\r\\nphysics, what happens is that a spherical wave of light travels outward\\r\\nfrom the star through space, just as, when you drop a stone into a\\r\\nstagnant pond, ripples travel outward from the place where the stone hit\\r\\nthe water. the wave of light travels with a certain very nearly constant\\r\\nvelocity, roughly 300,000 kilometres per second. this velocity may be\\r\\nascertained by sending a flash of light to a mirror, and observing\\r\\nhow long it takes before the reflected flash reaches you, just as the\\r\\nvelocity of sound may be ascertained by means of an echo.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat it is that happens when a wave of light reaches a given place we\\r\\ncannot tell, except in the sole case when the place in question is a\\r\\nbrain connected with an eye which is turned in the right direction. in\\r\\nthis one very special case we know what happens: we have the sensation\\r\\ncalled \"seeing the star.\" in all other cases, though we know (more or\\r\\nless hypothetically) some of the correlations and abstract properties\\r\\nof the appearance of the star, we do not know the appearance itself. now\\r\\nyou may, for the sake of illustration, compare the different appearances\\r\\nof the star to the conjugation of a greek verb, except that the number\\r\\nof its parts is really infinite, and not only apparently so to the\\r\\ndespairing schoolboy. in vacuo, the parts are regular, and can be\\r\\nderived from the (imaginary) root according to the laws of grammar,\\r\\ni.e. of perspective. the star being situated in empty space, it may be\\r\\ndefined, for purposes of physics, as consisting of all those appearances\\r\\nwhich it presents in vacuo, together with those which, according to\\r\\nthe laws of perspective, it would present elsewhere if its appearances\\r\\nelsewhere were regular. this is merely the adaptation of the definition\\r\\nof matter which i gave in an earlier lecture. the appearance of a star\\r\\nat a certain place, if it is regular, does not require any cause or\\r\\nexplanation beyond the existence of the star. every regular appearance\\r\\nis an actual member of the system which is the star, and its causation\\r\\nis entirely internal to that system. we may express this by saying that\\r\\na regular appearance is due to the star alone, and is actually part of\\r\\nthe star, in the sense in which a man is part of the human race.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut presently the light of the star reaches our atmosphere. it begins\\r\\nto be refracted, and dimmed by mist, and its velocity is slightly\\r\\ndiminished. at last it reaches a human eye, where a complicated process\\r\\ntakes place, ending in a sensation which gives us our grounds for\\r\\nbelieving in all that has gone before. now, the irregular appearances of\\r\\nthe star are not, strictly speaking, members of the system which is the\\r\\nstar, according to our definition of matter. the irregular appearances,\\r\\nhowever, are not merely irregular: they proceed according to laws which\\r\\ncan be stated in terms of the matter through which the light has\\r\\npassed on its way. the sources of an irregular appearance are therefore\\r\\ntwofold:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the object which is appearing irregularly;\\r\\n\\r\\n2) the intervening medium.\\r\\n\\r\\nit should be observed that, while the conception of a regular appearance\\r\\nis perfectly precise, the conception of an irregular appearance is one\\r\\ncapable of any degree of vagueness. when the distorting influence of the\\r\\nmedium is sufficiently great, the resulting particular can no longer be\\r\\nregarded as an appearance of an object, but must be treated on its own\\r\\naccount. this happens especially when the particular in question cannot\\r\\nbe traced back to one object, but is a blend of two or more. this case\\r\\nis normal in perception: we see as one what the microscope or telescope\\r\\nreveals to be many different objects. the notion of perception is\\r\\ntherefore not a precise one: we perceive things more or less, but always\\r\\nwith a very considerable amount of vagueness and confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nin considering irregular appearances, there are certain very natural\\r\\nmistakes which must be avoided. in order that a particular may count as\\r\\nan irregular appearance of a certain object, it is not necessary that\\r\\nit should bear any resemblance to the regular appearances as regard\\r\\nits intrinsic qualities. all that is necessary is that it should be\\r\\nderivable from the regular appearances by the laws which express\\r\\nthe distorting influence of the medium. when it is so derivable,\\r\\nthe particular in question may be regarded as caused by the regular\\r\\nappearances, and therefore by the object itself, together with the\\r\\nmodifications resulting from the medium. in other cases, the particular\\r\\nin question may, in the same sense, be regarded as caused by several\\r\\nobjects together with the medium; in this case, it may be called a\\r\\nconfused appearance of several objects. if it happens to be in a brain,\\r\\nit may be called a confused perception of these objects. all actual\\r\\nperception is confused to a greater or less extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now interpret in terms of our theory the distinction between\\r\\nthose mental occurrences which are said to have an external stimulus,\\r\\nand those which are said to be \"centrally excited,\" i.e. to have no\\r\\nstimulus external to the brain. when a mental occurrence can be regarded\\r\\nas an appearance of an object external to the brain, however irregular,\\r\\nor even as a confused appearance of several such objects, then we may\\r\\nregard it as having for its stimulus the object or objects in question,\\r\\nor their appearances at the sense-organ concerned. when, on the other\\r\\nhand, a mental occurrence has not sufficient connection with objects\\r\\nexternal to the brain to be regarded as an appearance of such objects,\\r\\nthen its physical causation (if any) will have to be sought in the\\r\\nbrain. in the former case it can be called a perception; in the latter\\r\\nit cannot be so called. but the distinction is one of degree, not of\\r\\nkind. until this is realized, no satisfactory theory of perception,\\r\\nsensation, or imagination is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture viii. sensations and images\\r\\n\\r\\nthe dualism of mind and matter, if we have been right so far, cannot be\\r\\nallowed as metaphysically valid. nevertheless, we seem to find a certain\\r\\ndualism, perhaps not ultimate, within the world as we observe it. the\\r\\ndualism is not primarily as to the stuff of the world, but as to causal\\r\\nlaws. on this subject we may again quote william james. he points out\\r\\nthat when, as we say, we merely \"imagine\" things, there are no such\\r\\neffects as would ensue if the things were what we call \"real.\" he takes\\r\\nthe case of imagining a fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i make for myself an experience of blazing fire; i place it near my\\r\\nbody; but it does not warm me in the least. i lay a stick upon it and\\r\\nthe stick either burns or remains green, as i please. i call up water,\\r\\nand pour it on the fire, and absolutely no difference ensues. i account\\r\\nfor all such facts by calling this whole train of experiences unreal, a\\r\\nmental train. mental fire is what won\\'t burn real sticks; mental water\\r\\nis what won\\'t necessarily (though of course it may) put out even a\\r\\nmental fire.... with \\'real\\' objects, on the contrary, consequences\\r\\nalways accrue; and thus the real experiences get sifted from the mental\\r\\nones, the things from our thoughts of them, fanciful or true, and\\r\\nprecipitated together as the stable part of the whole experience--chaos,\\r\\nunder the name of the physical world.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"essays in radical empiricism,\" pp. 32-3.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this passage james speaks, by mere inadvertence, as though the\\r\\nphenomena which he is describing as \"mental\" had no effects. this is, of\\r\\ncourse, not the case: they have their effects, just as much as physical\\r\\nphenomena do, but their effects follow different laws. for example,\\r\\ndreams, as freud has shown, are just as much subject to laws as are the\\r\\nmotions of the planets. but the laws are different: in a dream you may\\r\\nbe transported from one place to another in a moment, or one person\\r\\nmay turn into another under your eyes. such differences compel you to\\r\\ndistinguish the world of dreams from the physical world.\\r\\n\\r\\nif the two sorts of causal laws could be sharply distinguished, we could\\r\\ncall an occurrence \"physical\" when it obeys causal laws appropriate to\\r\\nthe physical world, and \"mental\" when it obeys causal laws appropriate\\r\\nto the mental world. since the mental world and the physical world\\r\\ninteract, there would be a boundary between the two: there would be\\r\\nevents which would have physical causes and mental effects, while there\\r\\nwould be others which would have mental causes and physical effects.\\r\\nthose that have physical causes and mental effects we should define as\\r\\n\"sensations.\" those that have mental causes and physical effects might\\r\\nperhaps be identified with what we call voluntary movements; but they do\\r\\nnot concern us at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese definitions would have all the precision that could be desired if\\r\\nthe distinction between physical and psychological causation were clear\\r\\nand sharp. as a matter of fact, however, this distinction is, as yet, by\\r\\nno means sharp. it is possible that, with fuller knowledge, it will be\\r\\nfound to be no more ultimate than the distinction between the laws of\\r\\ngases and the laws of rigid bodies. it also suffers from the fact that\\r\\nan event may be an effect of several causes according to several causal\\r\\nlaws we cannot, in general, point to anything unique as the cause of\\r\\nsuch-and-such an event. and finally it is by no means certain that\\r\\nthe peculiar causal laws which govern mental events are not really\\r\\nphysiological. the law of habit, which is one of the most distinctive,\\r\\nmay be fully explicable in terms of the peculiarities of nervous tissue,\\r\\nand these peculiarities, in turn, may be explicable by the laws of\\r\\nphysics. it seems, therefore, that we are driven to a different kind of\\r\\ndefinition. it is for this reason that it was necessary to develop\\r\\nthe definition of perception. with this definition, we can define a\\r\\nsensation as the non-mnemic elements in a perception.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen, following our definition, we try to decide what elements in our\\r\\nexperience are of the nature of sensations, we find more difficulty\\r\\nthan might have been expected. prima facie, everything is sensation that\\r\\ncomes to us through the senses: the sights we see, the sounds we hear,\\r\\nthe smells we smell, and so on; also such things as headache or the\\r\\nfeeling of muscular strain. but in actual fact so much interpretation,\\r\\nso much of habitual correlation, is mixed with all such experiences,\\r\\nthat the core of pure sensation is only to be extracted by careful\\r\\ninvestigation. to take a simple illustration: if you go to the theatre\\r\\nin your own country, you seem to hear equally well in the stalls or the\\r\\ndress circle; in either case you think you miss nothing. but if you go\\r\\nin a foreign country where you have a fair knowledge of the language,\\r\\nyou will seem to have grown partially deaf, and you will find it\\r\\nnecessary to be much nearer the stage than you would need to be in your\\r\\nown country. the reason is that, in hearing our own language spoken, we\\r\\nquickly and unconsciously fill out what we really hear with inferences\\r\\nto what the man must be saying, and we never realize that we have not\\r\\nheard the words we have merely inferred. in a foreign language, these\\r\\ninferences are more difficult, and we are more dependent upon actual\\r\\nsensation. if we found ourselves in a foreign world, where tables looked\\r\\nlike cushions and cushions like tables, we should similarly discover how\\r\\nmuch of what we think we see is really inference. every fairly familiar\\r\\nsensation is to us a sign of the things that usually go with it, and\\r\\nmany of these things will seem to form part of the sensation. i remember\\r\\nin the early days of motor-cars being with a friend when a tyre burst\\r\\nwith a loud report. he thought it was a pistol, and supported his\\r\\nopinion by maintaining that he had seen the flash. but of course there\\r\\nhad been no flash. nowadays no one sees a flash when a tyre bursts.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order, therefore, to arrive at what really is sensation in an\\r\\noccurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have\\r\\nto pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation.\\r\\nthis is a matter for the psychologist, and by no means an easy matter.\\r\\nfor our purposes, it is not important to determine what exactly is the\\r\\nsensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that\\r\\nthere certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and\\r\\ninterpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the\\r\\ndiversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to\\r\\nthe senses. when you open your newspaper in the morning, the actual\\r\\nsensations of seeing the print form a very minute part of what goes\\r\\non in you, but they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it\\r\\nis through them that the newspaper is a means of information or\\r\\nmis-information. thus, although it may be difficult to determine what\\r\\nexactly is sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is\\r\\nsensation, unless, like leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world\\r\\nupon us.\\r\\n\\r\\nsensations are obviously the source of our knowledge of the world,\\r\\nincluding our own body. it might seem natural to regard a sensation as\\r\\nitself a cognition, and until lately i did so regard it. when, say, i\\r\\nsee a person i know coming towards me in the street, it seems as\\r\\nthough the mere seeing were knowledge. it is of course undeniable that\\r\\nknowledge comes through the seeing, but i think it is a mistake to\\r\\nregard the mere seeing itself as knowledge. if we are so to regard it,\\r\\nwe must distinguish the seeing from what is seen: we must say that, when\\r\\nwe see a patch of colour of a certain shape, the patch of colour is one\\r\\nthing and our seeing of it is another. this view, however, demands the\\r\\nadmission of the subject, or act, in the sense discussed in our first\\r\\nlecture. if there is a subject, it can have a relation to the patch of\\r\\ncolour, namely, the sort of relation which we might call awareness. in\\r\\nthat case the sensation, as a mental event, will consist of awareness of\\r\\nthe colour, while the colour itself will remain wholly physical, and\\r\\nmay be called the sense-datum, to distinguish it from the sensation.\\r\\nthe subject, however, appears to be a logical fiction, like mathematical\\r\\npoints and instants. it is introduced, not because observation reveals\\r\\nit, but because it is linguistically convenient and apparently demanded\\r\\nby grammar. nominal entities of this sort may or may not exist, but\\r\\nthere is no good ground for assuming that they do. the functions that\\r\\nthey appear to perform can always be performed by classes or series or\\r\\nother logical constructions, consisting of less dubious entities. if we\\r\\nare to avoid a perfectly gratuitous assumption, we must dispense with\\r\\nthe subject as one of the actual ingredients of the world. but when\\r\\nwe do this, the possibility of distinguishing the sensation from\\r\\nthe sense-datum vanishes; at least i see no way of preserving the\\r\\ndistinction. accordingly the sensation that we have when we see a patch\\r\\nof colour simply is that patch of colour, an actual constituent of the\\r\\nphysical world, and part of what physics is concerned with. a patch of\\r\\ncolour is certainly not knowledge, and therefore we cannot say that pure\\r\\nsensation is cognitive. through its psychological effects, it is the\\r\\ncause of cognitions, partly by being itself a sign of things that\\r\\nare correlated with it, as e.g. sensations of sight and touch are\\r\\ncorrelated, and partly by giving rise to images and memories after the\\r\\nsensation is faded. but in itself the pure sensation is not cognitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the first lecture we considered the view of brentano, that \"we may\\r\\ndefine psychical phenomena by saying that they are phenomena which\\r\\nintentionally contain an object.\" we saw reasons to reject this view in\\r\\ngeneral; we are now concerned to show that it must be rejected in the\\r\\nparticular case of sensations. the kind of argument which formerly made\\r\\nme accept brentano\\'s view in this case was exceedingly simple. when i\\r\\nsee a patch of colour, it seemed to me that the colour is not psychical,\\r\\nbut physical, while my seeing is not physical, but psychical. hence\\r\\ni concluded that the colour is something other than my seeing of\\r\\nthe colour. this argument, to me historically, was directed against\\r\\nidealism: the emphatic part of it was the assertion that the colour is\\r\\nphysical, not psychical. i shall not trouble you now with the grounds\\r\\nfor holding as against berkeley that the patch of colour is physical; i\\r\\nhave set them forth before, and i see no reason to modify them. but it\\r\\ndoes not follow that the patch of colour is not also psychical, unless\\r\\nwe assume that the physical and the psychical cannot overlap, which i\\r\\nno longer consider a valid assumption. if we admit--as i think we\\r\\nshould--that the patch of colour may be both physical and psychical, the\\r\\nreason for distinguishing the sense-datum from the sensation disappears,\\r\\nand we may say that the patch of colour and our sensation in seeing it\\r\\nare identical.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is the view of william james, professor dewey, and the american\\r\\nrealists. perceptions, says professor dewey, are not per se cases of\\r\\nknowledge, but simply natural events with no more knowledge status\\r\\nthan (say) a shower. \"let them [the realists] try the experiment of\\r\\nconceiving perceptions as pure natural events, not cases of awareness or\\r\\napprehension, and they will be surprised to see how little they miss.\"*\\r\\ni think he is right in this, except in supposing that the realists will\\r\\nbe surprised. many of them already hold the view he is advocating, and\\r\\nothers are very sympathetic to it. at any rate, it is the view which i\\r\\nshall adopt in these lectures.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * dewey, \"essays in experimental logic,\" pp. 253, 262.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe stuff of the world, so far as we have experience of it, consists, on\\r\\nthe view that i am advocating, of innumerable transient particulars such\\r\\nas occur in seeing, hearing, etc., together with images more or less\\r\\nresembling these, of which i shall speak shortly. if physics is true,\\r\\nthere are, besides the particulars that we experience, others, probably\\r\\nequally (or almost equally) transient, which make up that part of the\\r\\nmaterial world that does not come into the sort of contact with a\\r\\nliving body that is required to turn it into a sensation. but this topic\\r\\nbelongs to the philosophy of physics, and need not concern us in our\\r\\npresent inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nsensations are what is common to the mental and physical worlds; they\\r\\nmay be defined as the intersection of mind and matter. this is by no\\r\\nmeans a new view; it is advocated, not only by the american authors i\\r\\nhave mentioned, but by mach in his analysis of sensations, which was\\r\\npublished in 1886. the essence of sensation, according to the view i am\\r\\nadvocating, is its independence of past experience. it is a core in our\\r\\nactual experiences, never existing in isolation except possibly in very\\r\\nyoung infants. it is not itself knowledge, but it supplies the data for\\r\\nour knowledge of the physical world, including our own bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are some who believe that our mental life is built up out of\\r\\nsensations alone. this may be true; but in any case i think the only\\r\\ningredients required in addition to sensations are images. what images\\r\\nare, and how they are to be defined, we have now to inquire.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe distinction between images and sensations might seem at first sight\\r\\nby no means difficult. when we shut our eyes and call up pictures of\\r\\nfamiliar scenes, we usually have no difficulty, so long as we remain\\r\\nawake, in discriminating between what we are imagining and what is\\r\\nreally seen. if we imagine some piece of music that we know, we can go\\r\\nthrough it in our mind from beginning to end without any discoverable\\r\\ntendency to suppose that we are really hearing it. but although such\\r\\ncases are so clear that no confusion seems possible, there are many\\r\\nothers that are far more difficult, and the definition of images is by\\r\\nno means an easy problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nto begin with: we do not always know whether what we are experiencing is\\r\\na sensation or an image. the things we see in dreams when our eyes are\\r\\nshut must count as images, yet while we are dreaming they seem like\\r\\nsensations. hallucinations often begin as persistent images, and only\\r\\ngradually acquire that influence over belief that makes the patient\\r\\nregard them as sensations. when we are listening for a faint sound--the\\r\\nstriking of a distant clock, or a horse\\'s hoofs on the road--we think\\r\\nwe hear it many times before we really do, because expectation brings\\r\\nus the image, and we mistake it for sensation. the distinction between\\r\\nimages and sensations is, therefore, by no means always obvious to\\r\\ninspection.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * on the distinction between images and sensation, cf.\\r\\n     semon, \"die mnemischen empfindungen,\" pp. 19-20.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may consider three different ways in which it has been sought to\\r\\ndistinguish images from sensations, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) by the less degree of vividness in images;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) by our absence of belief in their \"physical reality\";\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) by the fact that their causes and effects are different from those\\r\\nof sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\ni believe the third of these to be the only universally applicable\\r\\ncriterion. the other two are applicable in very many cases, but\\r\\ncannot be used for purposes of definition because they are liable to\\r\\nexceptions. nevertheless, they both deserve to be carefully considered.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) hume, who gives the names \"impressions\" and \"ideas\" to what may,\\r\\nfor present purposes, be identified with our \"sensations\" and \"images,\"\\r\\nspeaks of impressions as \"those perceptions which enter with most force\\r\\nand violence\" while he defines ideas as \"the faint images of these (i.e.\\r\\nof impressions) in thinking and reasoning.\" his immediately following\\r\\nobservations, however, show the inadequacy of his criteria of \"force\"\\r\\nand \"faintness.\" he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in\\r\\nexplaining this distinction. every one of himself will readily perceive\\r\\nthe difference betwixt feeling and thinking. the common degrees of these\\r\\nare easily distinguished, though it is not impossible but in particular\\r\\ninstances they may very nearly approach to each other. thus in sleep, in\\r\\na fever, in madness, or in any very violent emotions of soul, our ideas\\r\\nmay approach to our impressions; as, on the other hand, it sometimes\\r\\nhappens, that our impressions are so faint and low that we cannot\\r\\ndistinguish them from our ideas. but notwithstanding this near\\r\\nresemblance in a few instances, they are in general so very different,\\r\\nthat no one can make a scruple to rank them under distinct heads, and\\r\\nassign to each a peculiar name to mark the difference\" (\"treatise of\\r\\nhuman nature,\" part i, section i).\\r\\n\\r\\ni think hume is right in holding that they should be ranked under\\r\\ndistinct heads, with a peculiar name for each. but by his own confession\\r\\nin the above passage, his criterion for distinguishing them is not\\r\\nalways adequate. a definition is not sound if it only applies in cases\\r\\nwhere the difference is glaring: the essential purpose of a definition\\r\\nis to provide a mark which is applicable even in marginal cases--except,\\r\\nof course, when we are dealing with a conception, like, e.g. baldness,\\r\\nwhich is one of degree and has no sharp boundaries. but so far we have\\r\\nseen no reason to think that the difference between sensations and\\r\\nimages is only one of degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nprofessor stout, in his \"manual of psychology,\" after discussing various\\r\\nways of distinguishing sensations and images, arrives at a view which is\\r\\na modification of hume\\'s. he says (i quote from the second edition):\\r\\n\\r\\n\"our conclusion is that at bottom the distinction between image\\r\\nand percept, as respectively faint and vivid states, is based on a\\r\\ndifference of quality. the percept has an aggressiveness which does not\\r\\nbelong to the image. it strikes the mind with varying degrees of force\\r\\nor liveliness according to the varying intensity of the stimulus. this\\r\\ndegree of force or liveliness is part of what we ordinarily mean by\\r\\nthe intensity of a sensation. but this constituent of the intensity of\\r\\nsensations is absent in mental imagery\"(p. 419).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis view allows for the fact that sensations may reach any degree of\\r\\nfaintness--e.g. in the case of a just visible star or a just audible\\r\\nsound--without becoming images, and that therefore mere faintness cannot\\r\\nbe the characteristic mark of images. after explaining the sudden shock\\r\\nof a flash of lightning or a steam-whistle, stout says that \"no mere\\r\\nimage ever does strike the mind in this manner\"(p. 417). but i believe\\r\\nthat this criterion fails in very much the same instances as those in\\r\\nwhich hume\\'s criterion fails in its original form. macbeth speaks of--\\r\\n\\r\\n               that suggestion\\r\\n           whose horrid image doth unfix my hair\\r\\n     and make my seated heart knock at my ribs\\r\\n     against the use of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe whistle of a steam-engine could hardly have a stronger effect than\\r\\nthis. a very intense emotion will often bring with it--especially\\r\\nwhere some future action or some undecided issue is involved--powerful\\r\\ncompelling images which may determine the whole course of life, sweeping\\r\\naside all contrary solicitations to the will by their capacity for\\r\\nexclusively possessing the mind. and in all cases where images,\\r\\noriginally recognized as such, gradually pass into hallucinations, there\\r\\nmust be just that \"force or liveliness\" which is supposed to be always\\r\\nabsent from images. the cases of dreams and fever-delirium are as\\r\\nhard to adjust to professor stout\\'s modified criterion as to hume\\'s. i\\r\\nconclude therefore that the test of liveliness, however applicable in\\r\\nordinary instances, cannot be used to define the differences between\\r\\nsensations and images.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) we might attempt to distinguish images from sensations by our\\r\\nabsence of belief in the \"physical reality\" of images. when we are aware\\r\\nthat what we are experiencing is an image, we do not give it the kind of\\r\\nbelief that we should give to a sensation: we do not think that it has\\r\\nthe same power of producing knowledge of the \"external world.\" images\\r\\nare \"imaginary\"; in some sense they are \"unreal.\" but this difference\\r\\nis hard to analyse or state correctly. what we call the \"unreality\" of\\r\\nimages requires interpretation it cannot mean what would be expressed\\r\\nby saying \"there\\'s no such thing.\" images are just as truly part of the\\r\\nactual world as sensations are. all that we really mean by calling an\\r\\nimage \"unreal\" is that it does not have the concomitants which it would\\r\\nhave if it were a sensation. when we call up a visual image of a chair,\\r\\nwe do not attempt to sit in it, because we know that, like macbeth\\'s\\r\\ndagger, it is not \"sensible to feeling as to sight\"--i.e. it does not\\r\\nhave the correlations with tactile sensations which it would have if it\\r\\nwere a visual sensation and not merely a visual image. but this means\\r\\nthat the so-called \"unreality\" of images consists merely in their not\\r\\nobeying the laws of physics, and thus brings us back to the causal\\r\\ndistinction between images and sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis view is confirmed by the fact that we only feel images to be\\r\\n\"unreal\" when we already know them to be images. images cannot be\\r\\ndefined by the feeling of unreality, because when we falsely believe an\\r\\nimage to be a sensation, as in the case of dreams, it feels just as real\\r\\nas if it were a sensation. our feeling of unreality results from our\\r\\nhaving already realized that we are dealing with an image, and cannot\\r\\ntherefore be the definition of what we mean by an image. as soon as an\\r\\nimage begins to deceive us as to its status, it also deceives us as to\\r\\nits correlations, which are what we mean by its \"reality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) this brings us to the third mode of distinguishing images from\\r\\nsensations, namely, by their causes and effects. i believe this to be\\r\\nthe only valid ground of distinction. james, in the passage about the\\r\\nmental fire which won\\'t burn real sticks, distinguishes images by their\\r\\neffects, but i think the more reliable distinction is by their causes.\\r\\nprofessor stout (loc. cit., p. 127) says: \"one characteristic mark of\\r\\nwhat we agree in calling sensation is its mode of production. it is\\r\\ncaused by what we call a stimulus. a stimulus is always some condition\\r\\nexternal to the nervous system itself and operating upon it.\" i think\\r\\nthat this is the correct view, and that the distinction between images\\r\\nand sensations can only be made by taking account of their causation.\\r\\nsensations come through sense-organs, while images do not. we cannot\\r\\nhave visual sensations in the dark, or with our eyes shut, but we can\\r\\nvery well have visual images under these circumstances. accordingly\\r\\nimages have been defined as \"centrally excited sensations,\" i.e.\\r\\nsensations which have their physiological cause in the brain only, not\\r\\nalso in the sense-organs and the nerves that run from the sense-organs\\r\\nto the brain. i think the phrase \"centrally excited sensations\" assumes\\r\\nmore than is necessary, since it takes it for granted that an image must\\r\\nhave a proximate physiological cause. this is probably true, but it is\\r\\nan hypothesis, and for our purposes an unnecessary one. it would seem to\\r\\nfit better with what we can immediately observe if we were to say that\\r\\nan image is occasioned, through association, by a sensation or another\\r\\nimage, in other words that it has a mnemic cause--which does not prevent\\r\\nit from also having a physical cause. and i think it will be found that\\r\\nthe causation of an image always proceeds according to mnemic laws, i.e.\\r\\nthat it is governed by habit and past experience. if you listen to a man\\r\\nplaying the pianola without looking at him, you will have images of his\\r\\nhands on the keys as if he were playing the piano; if you suddenly look\\r\\nat him while you are absorbed in the music, you will experience a shock\\r\\nof surprise when you notice that his hands are not touching the notes.\\r\\nyour image of his hands is due to the many times that you have heard\\r\\nsimilar sounds and at the same time seen the player\\'s hands on the\\r\\npiano. when habit and past experience play this part, we are in the\\r\\nregion of mnemic as opposed to ordinary physical causation. and i think\\r\\nthat, if we could regard as ultimately valid the difference between\\r\\nphysical and mnemic causation, we could distinguish images from\\r\\nsensations as having mnemic causes, though they may also have physical\\r\\ncauses. sensations, on the other hand, will only have physical causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever this may be, the practically effective distinction between\\r\\nsensations and images is that in the causation of sensations, but not\\r\\nof images, the stimulation of nerves carrying an effect into the brain,\\r\\nusually from the surface of the body, plays an essential part. and\\r\\nthis accounts for the fact that images and sensations cannot always be\\r\\ndistinguished by their intrinsic nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nimages also differ from sensations as regards their effects. sensations,\\r\\nas a rule, have both physical and mental effects. as you watch the train\\r\\nyou meant to catch leaving the station, there are both the successive\\r\\npositions of the train (physical effects) and the successive waves\\r\\nof fury and disappointment (mental effects). images, on the contrary,\\r\\nthough they may produce bodily movements, do so according to mnemic\\r\\nlaws, not according to the laws of physics. all their effects, of\\r\\nwhatever nature, follow mnemic laws. but this difference is less\\r\\nsuitable for definition than the difference as to causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nprofessor watson, as a logical carrying-out of his behaviourist theory,\\r\\ndenies altogether that there are any observable phenomena such as\\r\\nimages are supposed to be. he replaces them all by faint sensations, and\\r\\nespecially by pronunciation of words sotto voce. when we \"think\" of a\\r\\ntable (say), as opposed to seeing it, what happens, according to him, is\\r\\nusually that we are making small movements of the throat and tongue\\r\\nsuch as would lead to our uttering the word \"table\" if they were more\\r\\npronounced. i shall consider his view again in connection with words;\\r\\nfor the present i am only concerned to combat his denial of images. this\\r\\ndenial is set forth both in his book on \"behavior\" and in an article\\r\\ncalled \"image and affection in behavior\" in the \"journal of philosophy,\\r\\npsychology and scientific methods,\" vol. x (july, 1913). it seems to me\\r\\nthat in this matter he has been betrayed into denying plain facts in\\r\\nthe interests of a theory, namely, the supposed impossibility of\\r\\nintrospection. i dealt with the theory in lecture vi; for the present i\\r\\nwish to reinforce the view that the facts are undeniable.\\r\\n\\r\\nimages are of various sorts, according to the nature of the sensations\\r\\nwhich they copy. images of bodily movements, such as we have when we\\r\\nimagine moving an arm or, on a smaller scale, pronouncing a word,\\r\\nmight possibly be explained away on professor watson\\'s lines, as really\\r\\nconsisting in small incipient movements such as, if magnified and\\r\\nprolonged, would be the movements we are said to be imagining. whether\\r\\nthis is the case or not might even be decided experimentally. if there\\r\\nwere a delicate instrument for recording small movements in the mouth\\r\\nand throat, we might place such an instrument in a person\\'s mouth and\\r\\nthen tell him to recite a poem to himself, as far as possible only in\\r\\nimagination. i should not be at all surprised if it were found that\\r\\nactual small movements take place while he is \"mentally\" saying over\\r\\nthe verses. the point is important, because what is called \"thought\"\\r\\nconsists mainly (though i think not wholly) of inner speech. if\\r\\nprofessor watson is right as regards inner speech, this whole region\\r\\nis transferred from imagination to sensation. but since the question\\r\\nis capable of experimental decision, it would be gratuitous rashness to\\r\\noffer an opinion while that decision is lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut visual and auditory images are much more difficult to deal with in\\r\\nthis way, because they lack the connection with physical events in the\\r\\nouter world which belongs to visual and auditory sensations. suppose,\\r\\nfor example, that i am sitting in my room, in which there is an empty\\r\\narm-chair. i shut my eyes, and call up a visual image of a friend\\r\\nsitting in the arm-chair. if i thrust my image into the world of\\r\\nphysics, it contradicts all the usual physical laws. my friend reached\\r\\nthe chair without coming in at the door in the usual way; subsequent\\r\\ninquiry will show that he was somewhere else at the moment. if regarded\\r\\nas a sensation, my image has all the marks of the supernatural. my\\r\\nimage, therefore, is regarded as an event in me, not as having that\\r\\nposition in the orderly happenings of the public world that belongs to\\r\\nsensations. by saying that it is an event in me, we leave it possible\\r\\nthat it may be physiologically caused: its privacy may be only due to\\r\\nits connection with my body. but in any case it is not a public event,\\r\\nlike an actual person walking in at the door and sitting down in\\r\\nmy chair. and it cannot, like inner speech, be regarded as a small\\r\\nsensation, since it occupies just as large an area in my visual field as\\r\\nthe actual sensation would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nprofessor watson says: \"i should throw out imagery altogether\\r\\nand attempt to show that all natural thought goes on in terms of\\r\\nsensori-motor processes in the larynx.\" this view seems to me flatly to\\r\\ncontradict experience. if you try to persuade any uneducated person that\\r\\nshe cannot call up a visual picture of a friend sitting in a chair, but\\r\\ncan only use words describing what such an occurrence would be like,\\r\\nshe will conclude that you are mad. (this statement is based upon\\r\\nexperiment.) galton, as every one knows, investigated visual imagery,\\r\\nand found that education tends to kill it: the fellows of the royal\\r\\nsociety turned out to have much less of it than their wives. i see no\\r\\nreason to doubt his conclusion that the habit of abstract pursuits makes\\r\\nlearned men much inferior to the average in power of visualizing, and\\r\\nmuch more exclusively occupied with words in their \"thinking.\" and\\r\\nprofessor watson is a very learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall henceforth assume that the existence of images is admitted, and\\r\\nthat they are to be distinguished from sensations by their causes,\\r\\nas well as, in a lesser degree, by their effects. in their intrinsic\\r\\nnature, though they often differ from sensations by being more dim\\r\\nor vague or faint, yet they do not always or universally differ from\\r\\nsensations in any way that can be used for defining them. their privacy\\r\\nneed form no bar to the scientific study of them, any more than the\\r\\nprivacy of bodily sensations does. bodily sensations are admitted by\\r\\neven the most severe critics of introspection, although, like images,\\r\\nthey can only be observed by one observer. it must be admitted, however,\\r\\nthat the laws of the appearance and disappearance of images are little\\r\\nknown and difficult to discover, because we are not assisted, as in the\\r\\ncase of sensations, by our knowledge of the physical world.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere remains one very important point concerning images, which will\\r\\noccupy us much hereafter, and that is, their resemblance to previous\\r\\nsensations. they are said to be \"copies\" of sensations, always as\\r\\nregards the simple qualities that enter into them, though not always\\r\\nas regards the manner in which these are put together. it is generally\\r\\nbelieved that we cannot imagine a shade of colour that we have never\\r\\nseen, or a sound that we have never heard. on this subject hume is the\\r\\nclassic. he says, in the definitions already quoted:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"those perceptions, which enter with most force and violence, we may\\r\\nname impressions; and under this name i comprehend all our sensations,\\r\\npassions and emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul.\\r\\nby ideas i mean the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhe next explains the difference between simple and complex ideas, and\\r\\nexplains that a complex idea may occur without any similar complex\\r\\nimpression. but as regards simple ideas, he states that \"every simple\\r\\nidea has a simple impression, which resembles it, and every simple\\r\\nimpression a correspondent idea.\" he goes on to enunciate the general\\r\\nprinciple \"that all our simple ideas in their first appearance are\\r\\nderived from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and\\r\\nwhich they exactly represent\" (\"treatise of human nature,\" part i,\\r\\nsection i).\\r\\n\\r\\nit is this fact, that images resemble antecedent sensations, which\\r\\nenables us to call them images \"of\" this or that. for the understanding\\r\\nof memory, and of knowledge generally, the recognizable resemblance of\\r\\nimages and sensations is of fundamental importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are difficulties in establishing hume\\'s principles, and doubts\\r\\nas to whether it is exactly true. indeed, he himself signalized an\\r\\nexception immediately after stating his maxim. nevertheless, it is\\r\\nimpossible to doubt that in the main simple images are copies of similar\\r\\nsimple sensations which have occurred earlier, and that the same is true\\r\\nof complex images in all cases of memory as opposed to mere imagination.\\r\\nour power of acting with reference to what is sensibly absent is largely\\r\\ndue to this characteristic of images, although, as education advances,\\r\\nimages tend to be more and more replaced by words. we shall have much\\r\\nto say in the next two lectures on the subject of images as copies of\\r\\nsensations. what has been said now is merely by way of reminder that\\r\\nthis is their most notable characteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\ni am by no means confident that the distinction between images and\\r\\nsensations is ultimately valid, and i should be glad to be convinced\\r\\nthat images can be reduced to sensations of a peculiar kind. i think it\\r\\nis clear, however, that, at any rate in the case of auditory and visual\\r\\nimages, they do differ from ordinary auditory and visual sensations, and\\r\\ntherefore form a recognizable class of occurrences, even if it should\\r\\nprove that they can be regarded as a sub-class of sensations. this is\\r\\nall that is necessary to validate the use of images to be made in the\\r\\nsequel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture ix. memory\\r\\n\\r\\nmemory, which we are to consider to-day, introduces us to knowledge in\\r\\none of its forms. the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end\\r\\nof the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole\\r\\nenterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not myself believe that the analysis of knowledge can be effected\\r\\nentirely by means of purely external observation, such as behaviourists\\r\\nemploy. i shall discuss this question in later lectures. in the present\\r\\nlecture i shall attempt the analysis of memory-knowledge, both as an\\r\\nintroduction to the problem of knowledge in general, and because memory,\\r\\nin some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge. sensation,\\r\\nwe decided, is not a form of knowledge. it might, however, have\\r\\nbeen expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with\\r\\nperception, i.e. with that integral experience of things in the\\r\\nenvironment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological\\r\\nanalysis. what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact\\r\\nthat the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates--images\\r\\nand expectations of their usual correlates--all of which are\\r\\nsubjectively indistinguishable from the sensation. the fact of past\\r\\nexperience is essential in producing this filling-out of sensation, but\\r\\nnot the recollection of past experience. the non-sensational elements in\\r\\nperception can be wholly explained as the result of habit, produced\\r\\nby frequent correlations. perception, according to our definition in\\r\\nlecture vii, is no more a form of knowledge than sensation is, except\\r\\nin so far as it involves expectations. the purely psychological problems\\r\\nwhich it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been\\r\\nrendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility\\r\\nof the non-sensational elements of perception. on the other hand, memory\\r\\nraises many difficult and very important problems, which it is necessary\\r\\nto consider at the first possible moment.\\r\\n\\r\\none reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it seems to\\r\\nbe involved in the fact that images are recognized as \"copies\" of\\r\\npast sensible experience. in the preceding lecture i alluded to hume\\'s\\r\\nprinciple \"that all our simple ideas in their first appearance are\\r\\nderived from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and\\r\\nwhich they exactly represent.\" whether or not this principle is liable\\r\\nto exceptions, everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of\\r\\ntruth, though the word \"exactly\" might seem an overstatement, and\\r\\nit might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent\\r\\nimpressions. such modifications of hume\\'s principle, however, do not\\r\\naffect the problem which i wish to present for your consideration,\\r\\nnamely: why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always,\\r\\napproximately or exactly, copies of sensations? what sort of evidence is\\r\\nthere? and what sort of evidence is logically possible? the difficulty\\r\\nof this question arises through the fact that the sensation which an\\r\\nimage is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists, and can\\r\\ntherefore only be known by memory, while, on the other hand, memory of\\r\\npast sensations seems only possible by means of present images. how,\\r\\nthen, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past\\r\\nsensation? the problem is just as acute if we say that images differ\\r\\nfrom their prototypes as if we say that they resemble them; it is the\\r\\nvery possibility of comparison that is hard to understand.* we think\\r\\nwe can know that they are alike or different, but we cannot bring them\\r\\ntogether in one experience and compare them. to deal with this problem,\\r\\nwe must have a theory of memory. in this way the whole status of images\\r\\nas \"copies\" is bound up with the analysis of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * how, for example, can we obtain such knowledge as the\\r\\n     following: \"if we look at, say, a red nose and perceive it,\\r\\n     and after a little while ekphore, its memory-image, we note\\r\\n     immediately how unlike, in its likeness, this memory-image\\r\\n     is to the original perception\" (a. wohlgemuth, \"on the\\r\\n     feelings and their neural correlate with an examination of\\r\\n     the nature of pain,\" \"journal of psychology,\" vol. viii,\\r\\n     part iv, june, 1917).\\r\\n\\r\\nin investigating memory-beliefs, there are certain points which must\\r\\nbe borne in mind. in the first place, everything constituting a\\r\\nmemory-belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the\\r\\nbelief is said to refer. it is not logically necessary to the existence\\r\\nof a memory-belief that the event remembered should have occurred,\\r\\nor even that the past should have existed at all. there is no logical\\r\\nimpossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five\\r\\nminutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that \"remembered\"\\r\\na wholly unreal past. there is no logically necessary connection between\\r\\nevents at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or\\r\\nwill happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world\\r\\nbegan five minutes ago. hence the occurrences which are called knowledge\\r\\nof the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly\\r\\nanalysable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just\\r\\nwhat they are even if no past had existed.\\r\\n\\r\\ni am not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be\\r\\nentertained as a serious hypothesis. like all sceptical hypotheses, it\\r\\nis logically tenable, but uninteresting. all that i am doing is to use\\r\\nits logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we\\r\\nremember.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to\\r\\nconstitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient. the\\r\\nbehaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has\\r\\nto trust his memory in making the record. \"habit\" is a concept involving\\r\\nthe occurrence of similar events at different times; if the behaviourist\\r\\nfeels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only\\r\\nbe because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have\\r\\nbeen other times. and the same applies to images. if we are to know as\\r\\nit is supposed we do--that images are \"copies,\" accurate or inaccurate,\\r\\nof past events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must\\r\\ngo to constitute this knowledge. for their mere occurrence, by itself,\\r\\nwould not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before.\\r\\n\\r\\ncan we constitute memory out of images together with suitable beliefs?\\r\\nwe may take it that memory-images, when they occur in true memory, are\\r\\n(a) known to be copies, (b) sometimes known to be imperfect copies\\r\\n(cf. footnote on previous page). how is it possible to know that a\\r\\nmemory-image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy\\r\\nby which to replace it? this would seem to suggest that we have a way\\r\\nof knowing the past which is independent of images, by means of which\\r\\nwe can criticize image-memories. but i do not think such an inference is\\r\\nwarranted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through images\\r\\nof which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images must have two\\r\\ncharacteristics by which we can arrange them in two series, of which one\\r\\ncorresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which\\r\\nthey refer, and the other to our greater or less confidence in their\\r\\naccuracy. we will take the second of these points first.\\r\\n\\r\\nour confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory-image\\r\\nmust, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image\\r\\nitself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the\\r\\npresent image. it might be suggested that vagueness is the required\\r\\ncharacteristic, but i do not think this is the case. we sometimes\\r\\nhave images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not\\r\\ntrust--for example, under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend\\'s\\r\\nface vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted. in such a case we\\r\\ndistrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear. i think\\r\\nthe characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the\\r\\nfeeling of familiarity that accompanies them. some images, like some\\r\\nsensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange. familiarity\\r\\nis a feeling capable of degrees. in an image of a well-known face,\\r\\nfor example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when this\\r\\nhappens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than\\r\\nin that of the unfamiliar parts. i think it is by this means that we\\r\\nbecome critical of images, not by some imageless memory with which\\r\\nwe compare them. i shall return to the consideration of familiarity\\r\\nshortly.\\r\\n\\r\\ni come now to the other characteristic which memory-images must have\\r\\nin order to account for our knowledge of the past. they must have some\\r\\ncharacteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less\\r\\nremote portions of the past. that is to say if we suppose that a is the\\r\\nevent remembered, b the remembering, and t the interval of time between\\r\\na and b, there must be some characteristic of b which is capable of\\r\\ndegrees, and which, in accurately dated memories, varies as t varies.\\r\\nit may increase as t increases, or diminish as t increases. the question\\r\\nwhich of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic\\r\\nserviceability of the characteristic in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nin actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur in\\r\\ngiving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered\\r\\nevent. there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling\\r\\nof \"pastness,\" especially where immediate memory is concerned. but apart\\r\\nfrom this, there are other marks. one of these is context. a recent\\r\\nmemory has, usually, more context than a more distant one. when a\\r\\nremembered event has a remembered context, this may occur in two ways,\\r\\neither (a) by successive images in the same order as their prototypes,\\r\\nor (b) by remembering a whole process simultaneously, in the same way in\\r\\nwhich a present process may be apprehended, through akoluthic sensations\\r\\nwhich, by fading, acquire the mark of just-pastness in an increasing\\r\\ndegree as they fade, and are thus placed in a series while all sensibly\\r\\npresent. it will be context in this second sense, more specially, that\\r\\nwill give us a sense of the nearness or remoteness of a remembered\\r\\nevent.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation\\r\\nof a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time-order of two\\r\\nremembered events. very often our knowledge of the temporal relation\\r\\nof a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal\\r\\nrelations to other remembered events. it would seem that only rather\\r\\nrecent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings\\r\\ngiving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such\\r\\nfeelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered\\r\\nevents.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less\\r\\naccurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two\\r\\nsorts of feelings: (1) those that may be called feelings of familiarity;\\r\\n(2) those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of\\r\\npastness. the first lead us to trust our memories, the second to assign\\r\\nplaces to them in the time-order.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now to analyse the memory-belief, as opposed to the\\r\\ncharacteristics of images which lead us to base memory-beliefs upon\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we had retained the \"subject\" or \"act\" in knowledge, the whole\\r\\nproblem of memory would have been comparatively simple. we could then\\r\\nhave said that remembering is a direct relation between the present act\\r\\nor subject and the past occurrence remembered: the act of remembering\\r\\nis present, though its object is past. but the rejection of the subject\\r\\nrenders some more complicated theory necessary. remembering has to be\\r\\na present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is\\r\\nremembered. and it is difficult to find any ground, except a pragmatic\\r\\none, for supposing that memory is not sheer delusion, if, as seems to be\\r\\nthe case, there is not, apart from memory, any way of ascertaining that\\r\\nthere really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our\\r\\npresent remembering. what, if we followed meinong\\'s terminology, we\\r\\nshould call the \"object\" in memory, i.e. the past event which we are\\r\\nsaid to be remembering, is unpleasantly remote from the \"content,\" i.e.\\r\\nthe present mental occurrence in remembering. there is an awkward gulf\\r\\nbetween the two, which raises difficulties for the theory of knowledge.\\r\\nbut we must not falsify observation to avoid theoretical difficulties.\\r\\nfor the present, therefore, let us forget these problems, and try to\\r\\ndiscover what actually occurs in memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must\\r\\narrive at. in this case, as in most others, what may be taken as certain\\r\\nin advance is rather vague. the study of any topic is like the continued\\r\\nobservation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is\\r\\ncertain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is some\\r\\nobject on the road. if you attempt to be less vague, and to assert that\\r\\nthe object is an elephant, or a man, or a mad dog, you run a risk of\\r\\nerror; but the purpose of continued observation is to enable you to\\r\\narrive at such more precise knowledge. in like manner, in the study of\\r\\nmemory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the\\r\\nmore precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain\\r\\nthan the hazy data from which you set out. nevertheless, in spite of the\\r\\nrisk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge\\r\\nof the past. we do not yet know with any precision what we mean by\\r\\n\"knowledge,\" and we must admit that in any given instance our memory may\\r\\nbe at fault. nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might urge in theory,\\r\\nwe cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning, that we did\\r\\nvarious things yesterday, that a great war has been taking place, and so\\r\\non. how far our knowledge of the past is due to memory, and how far to\\r\\nother sources, is of course a matter to be investigated, but there can\\r\\nbe no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of\\r\\nthe past.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the\\r\\npast than for knowing the future. we know some things about the future,\\r\\nfor example what eclipses there will be; but this knowledge is a matter\\r\\nof elaborate calculation and inference, whereas some of our knowledge of\\r\\nthe past comes to us without effort, in the same sort of immediate way\\r\\nin which we acquire knowledge of occurrences in our present environment.\\r\\nwe might provisionally, though perhaps not quite correctly, define\\r\\n\"memory\" as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in\\r\\nour knowledge of the future; such a definition would at least serve to\\r\\nmark the problem with which we are concerned, though some expectations\\r\\nmay deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.\\r\\n\\r\\na third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two, is that\\r\\nthe truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish\\r\\nall truth to be. it seems clear that some of the things i remember are\\r\\ntrivial and without any visible importance for the future, but that my\\r\\nmemory is true (or false) in virtue of a past event, not in virtue of\\r\\nany future consequences of my belief. the definition of truth as the\\r\\ncorrespondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the\\r\\ncase of memory, as against not only the pragmatist definition but also\\r\\nthe idealist definition by means of coherence. these considerations,\\r\\nhowever, are taking us away from psychology, to which we must now\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which bergson\\r\\ndistinguishes in the second chapter of his \"matter and memory,\"\\r\\nnamely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort that consists of\\r\\nindependent recollection. he gives the instance of learning a lesson\\r\\nby heart: when i know it by heart i am said to \"remember\" it, but this\\r\\nmerely means that i have acquired certain habits; on the other hand,\\r\\nmy recollection of (say) the second time i read the lesson while i was\\r\\nlearning it is the recollection of a unique event, which occurred only\\r\\nonce. the recollection of a unique event cannot, so bergson contends,\\r\\nbe wholly constituted by habit, and is in fact something radically\\r\\ndifferent from the memory which is habit. the recollection alone is true\\r\\nmemory. this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory. but\\r\\nit is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.\\r\\nhabit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life, and is often\\r\\npresent where at first sight it seems not to be. there is, for example,\\r\\na habit of remembering a unique event. when we have once described the\\r\\nevent, the words we have used easily become habitual. we may even have\\r\\nused words to describe it to ourselves while it was happening; in that\\r\\ncase, the habit of these words may fulfil the function of bergson\\'s true\\r\\nmemory, while in reality it is nothing but habit-memory. a gramophone,\\r\\nby the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its\\r\\npast; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to\\r\\nbelieve.\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite, however, of a difficulty in distinguishing the two forms of\\r\\nmemory in practice, there can be no doubt that both forms exist. i can\\r\\nset to work now to remember things i never remembered before, such\\r\\nas what i had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be\\r\\nwholly habit that enables me to do this. it is this sort of occurrence\\r\\nthat constitutes the essence of memory until we have analysed what\\r\\nhappens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding\\r\\nmemory.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is\\r\\na form of knowledge. whether knowledge itself is reducible to habit is\\r\\na question to which i shall return in a later lecture; for the present\\r\\ni am only anxious to point out that, whatever the true analysis of\\r\\nknowledge may be, knowledge of past occurrences is not proved by\\r\\nbehaviour which is due to past experience. the fact that a man can\\r\\nrecite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on\\r\\nwhich he has recited or read it. similarly, the performances of animals\\r\\nin getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not\\r\\nprove that they remember having been in the same situation before.\\r\\narguments in favour of (for example) memory in plants are only arguments\\r\\nin favour of habit-memory, not of knowledge-memory. samuel butler\\'s\\r\\narguments in favour of the view that an animal remembers something of\\r\\nthe lives of its ancestors* are, when examined, only arguments in favour\\r\\nof habit-memory. semon\\'s two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do\\r\\nnot touch knowledge-memory at all closely. they give laws according to\\r\\nwhich images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss\\r\\nour belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what\\r\\nconstitutes knowledge-memory. it is this that is of interest to theory\\r\\nof knowledge. i shall speak of it as \"true\" memory, to distinguish it\\r\\nfrom mere habit acquired through past experience. before considering\\r\\ntrue memory, it will be well to consider two things which are on the way\\r\\ntowards memory, namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see his \"life and habit and unconscious memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar,\\r\\nwithout having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which\\r\\nwe have seen it. we have this feeling normally in places where we have\\r\\noften been before--at home, or in well-known streets. most people and\\r\\nanimals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of\\r\\ntheir time in familiar surroundings, which are especially comforting\\r\\nwhen any danger threatens. the feeling of familiarity has all sorts\\r\\nof degrees, down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a\\r\\nperson before. it is by no means always reliable; almost everybody\\r\\nhas at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is\\r\\nhappening now happened before at some time. there are occasions when\\r\\nfamiliarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is\\r\\nmerely a vague feeling that something is familiar. this is illustrated\\r\\nby turgenev\\'s \"smoke,\" where the hero is long puzzled by a haunting\\r\\nsense that something in his present is recalling something in his past,\\r\\nand at last traces it to the smell of heliotrope. whenever the sense of\\r\\nfamiliarity occurs without a definite object, it leads us to search the\\r\\nenvironment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate\\r\\nobject, which leads us to the judgment: \"this is familiar.\" i think\\r\\nwe may regard familiarity as a definite feeling, capable of existing\\r\\nwithout an object, but normally standing in a specific relation to some\\r\\nfeature of the environment, the relation being that which we express in\\r\\nwords by saying that the feature in question is familiar. the judgment\\r\\nthat what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of\\r\\nreflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a\\r\\nhorse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable. thus\\r\\nno knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of\\r\\nfamiliarity alone.\\r\\n\\r\\na further stage is recognition. this may be taken in two senses,\\r\\nthe first when a thing not merely feels familiar, but we know it is\\r\\nsuch-and-such. we recognize our friend jones, we know cats and dogs\\r\\nwhen we see them, and so on. here we have a definite influence of past\\r\\nexperience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past. when\\r\\nwe see a cat, we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have\\r\\nseen, but we do not, as a rule, recollect at the moment any particular\\r\\noccasion when we have seen a cat. recognition in this sense does not\\r\\nnecessarily involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object\\r\\nwe are seeing at the moment is associated with the word \"cat,\" or with\\r\\nan auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may\\r\\nhappen to recognize in the cat of the moment. we are, of course, in\\r\\nfact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that we have seen it\\r\\nbefore, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in\\r\\nthis first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that\\r\\nnevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of\\r\\nthe word.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, another sense of the word, in which we mean by\\r\\nrecognition, not knowing the name of a thing or some other property of\\r\\nit, but knowing that we have seen it before in this sense recognition\\r\\ndoes involve knowledge about the fast. this knowledge is memory in\\r\\none sense, though in another it is not. it does not involve a definite\\r\\nmemory of a definite past event, but only the knowledge that something\\r\\nhappening now is similar to something that happened before. it differs\\r\\nfrom the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or\\r\\njudgment, which the sense of familiarity is not. i do not wish to\\r\\nundertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the\\r\\nsubject of the twelfth lecture; for the present i merely wish to\\r\\nemphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in\\r\\na belief, which we may express approximately in the words: \"this has\\r\\nexisted before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are, however, several points in which such an account of\\r\\nrecognition is inadequate. to begin with, it might seem at first sight\\r\\nmore correct to define recognition as \"i have seen this before\" than\\r\\nas \"this has existed before.\" we recognize a thing (it may be urged) as\\r\\nhaving been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not\\r\\nrecognize it as merely having been in the world before. i am not sure\\r\\nthat there is anything substantial in this point. the definition of \"my\\r\\nexperience\" is difficult; broadly speaking, it is everything that is\\r\\nconnected with what i am experiencing now by certain links, of which\\r\\nthe various forms of memory are among the most important. thus, if i\\r\\nrecognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue\\r\\nof which i recognize it forms part of \"my experience\" by definition:\\r\\nrecognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled\\r\\nout from the rest of the world. of course, the words \"this has existed\\r\\nbefore\" are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when\\r\\nwe form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable: words are\\r\\nframed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive,\\r\\nand are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as\\r\\nrecognition. i shall return to what is virtually the same question in\\r\\nconnection with true memory, which raises exactly similar problems.\\r\\n\\r\\na second point is that, when we recognize something, it was not in fact\\r\\nthe very same thing, but only something similar, that we experienced on\\r\\na former occasion. suppose the object in question is a friend\\'s face. a\\r\\nperson\\'s face is always changing, and is not exactly the same on any two\\r\\noccasions. common sense treats it as one face with varying expressions;\\r\\nbut the varying expressions actually exist, each at its proper time,\\r\\nwhile the one face is merely a logical construction. we regard two\\r\\nobjects as the same, for common-sense purposes, when the reaction they\\r\\ncall for is practically the same. two visual appearances, to both\\r\\nof which it is appropriate to say: \"hullo, jones!\" are treated as\\r\\nappearances of one identical object, namely jones. the name \"jones\" is\\r\\napplicable to both, and it is only reflection that shows us that many\\r\\ndiverse particulars are collected together to form the meaning of the\\r\\nname \"jones.\" what we see on any one occasion is not the whole series of\\r\\nparticulars that make up jones, but only one of them (or a few in quick\\r\\nsuccession). on another occasion we see another member of the series,\\r\\nbut it is sufficiently similar to count as the same from the standpoint\\r\\nof common sense. accordingly, when we judge \"i have seen this\\r\\nbefore,\" we judge falsely if \"this\" is taken as applying to the actual\\r\\nconstituent of the world that we are seeing at the moment. the\\r\\nword \"this\" must be interpreted vaguely so as to include anything\\r\\nsufficiently like what we are seeing at the moment. here, again, we\\r\\nshall find a similar point as regards true memory; and in connection\\r\\nwith true memory we will consider the point again. it is sometimes\\r\\nsuggested, by those who favour behaviourist views, that recognition\\r\\nconsists in behaving in the same way when a stimulus is repeated as we\\r\\nbehaved on the first occasion when it occurred. this seems to be the\\r\\nexact opposite of the truth. the essence of recognition is in the\\r\\ndifference between a repeated stimulus and a new one. on the first\\r\\noccasion there is no recognition; on the second occasion there is. in\\r\\nfact, recognition is another instance of the peculiarity of causal laws\\r\\nin psychology, namely, that the causal unit is not a single event, but\\r\\ntwo or more events habit is the great instance of this, but recognition\\r\\nis another. a stimulus occurring once has a certain effect; occurring\\r\\ntwice, it has the further effect of recognition. thus the phenomenon\\r\\nof recognition has as its cause the two occasions when the stimulus has\\r\\noccurred; either alone is insufficient. this complexity of causes\\r\\nin psychology might be connected with bergson\\'s arguments against\\r\\nrepetition in the mental world. it does not prove that there are no\\r\\ncausal laws in psychology, as bergson suggests; but it does prove that\\r\\nthe causal laws of psychology are prima facie very different from those\\r\\nof physics. on the possibility of explaining away the difference as due\\r\\nto the peculiarities of nervous tissue i have spoken before, but this\\r\\npossibility must not be forgotten if we are tempted to draw unwarranted\\r\\nmetaphysical deductions.\\r\\n\\r\\ntrue memory, which we must now endeavour to understand, consists of\\r\\nknowledge of past events, but not of all such knowledge. some knowledge\\r\\nof past events, for example what we learn through reading history, is\\r\\non a par with the knowledge we can acquire concerning the future: it\\r\\nis obtained by inference, not (so to speak) spontaneously. there is\\r\\na similar distinction in our knowledge of the present: some of it is\\r\\nobtained through the senses, some in more indirect ways. i know that\\r\\nthere are at this moment a number of people in the streets of new york,\\r\\nbut i do not know this in the immediate way in which i know of the\\r\\npeople whom i see by looking out of my window. it is not easy to state\\r\\nprecisely wherein the difference between these two sorts of knowledge\\r\\nconsists, but it is easy to feel the difference. for the moment, i shall\\r\\nnot stop to analyse it, but shall content myself with saying that, in\\r\\nthis respect, memory resembles the knowledge derived from the senses.\\r\\nit is immediate, not inferred, not abstract; it differs from perception\\r\\nmainly by being referred to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to memory, as throughout the analysis of knowledge, there are\\r\\ntwo very distinct problems, namely (1) as to the nature of the present\\r\\noccurrence in knowing; (2) as to the relation of this occurrence to what\\r\\nis known. when we remember, the knowing is now, while what is known is\\r\\nin the past. our two questions are, in the case of memory:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) what is the present occurrence when we remember?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) what is the relation of this present occurrence to the past event\\r\\nwhich is remembered?\\r\\n\\r\\nof these two questions, only the first concerns the psychologist; the\\r\\nsecond belongs to theory of knowledge. at the same time, if we accept\\r\\nthe vague datum with which we began, to the effect that, in some sense,\\r\\nthere is knowledge of the past, we shall have to find, if we can, such\\r\\nan account of the present occurrence in remembering as will make it not\\r\\nimpossible for remembering to give us knowledge of the past. for the\\r\\npresent, however, we shall do well to forget the problems concerning\\r\\ntheory of knowledge, and concentrate upon the purely psychological\\r\\nproblem of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nbetween memory-image and sensation there is an intermediate experience\\r\\nconcerning the immediate past. for example, a sound that we have just\\r\\nheard is present to us in a way which differs both from the sensation\\r\\nwhile we are hearing the sound and from the memory-image of something\\r\\nheard days or weeks ago. james states that it is this way of\\r\\napprehending the immediate past that is \"the original of our experience\\r\\nof pastness, from whence we get the meaning of the term\"(\"psychology,\"\\r\\ni, p. 604). everyone knows the experience of noticing (say) that\\r\\nthe clock has been striking, when we did not notice it while it was\\r\\nstriking. and when we hear a remark spoken, we are conscious of the\\r\\nearlier words while the later ones are being uttered, and this retention\\r\\nfeels different from recollection of something definitely past. a\\r\\nsensation fades gradually, passing by continuous gradations to the\\r\\nstatus of an image. this retention of the immediate past in a condition\\r\\nintermediate between sensation and image may be called \"immediate\\r\\nmemory.\" everything belonging to it is included with sensation in what\\r\\nis called the \"specious present.\" the specious present includes elements\\r\\nat all stages on the journey from sensation to image. it is this fact\\r\\nthat enables us to apprehend such things as movements, or the order of\\r\\nthe words in a spoken sentence. succession can occur within the specious\\r\\npresent, of which we can distinguish some parts as earlier and others as\\r\\nlater. it is to be supposed that the earliest parts are those that have\\r\\nfaded most from their original force, while the latest parts are those\\r\\nthat retain their full sensational character. at the beginning of a\\r\\nstimulus we have a sensation; then a gradual transition; and at the\\r\\nend an image. sensations while they are fading are called \"akoluthic\"\\r\\nsensations.* when the process of fading is completed (which happens very\\r\\nquickly), we arrive at the image, which is capable of being revived on\\r\\nsubsequent occasions with very little change. true memory, as opposed to\\r\\n\"immediate memory,\" applies only to events sufficiently distant to\\r\\nhave come to an end of the period of fading. such events, if they are\\r\\nrepresented by anything present, can only be represented by images, not\\r\\nby those intermediate stages, between sensations and images, which occur\\r\\nduring the period of fading.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see semon, \"die mnemischen empfindungen,\" chap. vi.\\r\\n\\r\\nimmediate memory is important both because it provides experience of\\r\\nsuccession, and because it bridges the gulf between sensations and\\r\\nthe images which are their copies. but it is now time to resume the\\r\\nconsideration of true memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuppose you ask me what i ate for breakfast this morning. suppose,\\r\\nfurther, that i have not thought about my breakfast in the meantime, and\\r\\nthat i did not, while i was eating it, put into words what it consisted\\r\\nof. in this case my recollection will be true memory, not habit-memory.\\r\\nthe process of remembering will consist of calling up images of my\\r\\nbreakfast, which will come to me with a feeling of belief such as\\r\\ndistinguishes memory-images from mere imagination-images. or sometimes\\r\\nwords may come without the intermediary of images; but in this case\\r\\nequally the feeling of belief is essential.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us omit from our consideration, for the present, the memories\\r\\nin which words replace images. these are always, i think, really\\r\\nhabit-memories, the memories that use images being the typical true\\r\\nmemories.\\r\\n\\r\\nmemory-images and imagination-images do not differ in their intrinsic\\r\\nqualities, so far as we can discover. they differ by the fact that\\r\\nthe images that constitute memories, unlike those that constitute\\r\\nimagination, are accompanied by a feeling of belief which may be\\r\\nexpressed in the words \"this happened.\" the mere occurrence of images,\\r\\nwithout this feeling of belief, constitutes imagination; it is the\\r\\nelement of belief that is the distinctive thing in memory.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * for belief of a specific kind, cf. dorothy wrinch \"on the\\r\\n     nature of memory,\" \"mind,\" january, 1920.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are, if i am not mistaken, at least three different kinds of\\r\\nbelief-feeling, which we may call respectively memory, expectation and\\r\\nbare assent. in what i call bare assent, there is no time-element in\\r\\nthe feeling of belief, though there may be in the content of what is\\r\\nbelieved. if i believe that caesar landed in britain in b.c. 55, the\\r\\ntime-determination lies, not in the feeling of belief, but in what is\\r\\nbelieved. i do not remember the occurrence, but have the same feeling\\r\\ntowards it as towards the announcement of an eclipse next year. but when\\r\\ni have seen a flash of lightning and am waiting for the thunder, i\\r\\nhave a belief-feeling analogous to memory, except that it refers to the\\r\\nfuture: i have an image of thunder, combined with a feeling which may be\\r\\nexpressed in the words: \"this will happen.\" so, in memory, the pastness\\r\\nlies, not in the content of what is believed, but in the nature of\\r\\nthe belief-feeling. i might have just the same images and expect their\\r\\nrealization; i might entertain them without any belief, as in reading a\\r\\nnovel; or i might entertain them together with a time-determination, and\\r\\ngive bare assent, as in reading history. i shall return to this subject\\r\\nin a later lecture, when we come to the analysis of belief. for the\\r\\npresent, i wish to make it clear that a certain special kind of belief\\r\\nis the distinctive characteristic of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem as to whether memory can be explained as habit or\\r\\nassociation requires to be considered afresh in connection with the\\r\\ncauses of our remembering something. let us take again the case of my\\r\\nbeing asked what i had for breakfast this morning. in this case the\\r\\nquestion leads to my setting to work to recollect. it is a little\\r\\nstrange that the question should instruct me as to what it is that i am\\r\\nto recall. this has to do with understanding words, which will be the\\r\\ntopic of the next lecture; but something must be said about it now. our\\r\\nunderstanding of the words \"breakfast this morning\" is a habit, in spite\\r\\nof the fact that on each fresh day they point to a different occasion.\\r\\n\"this morning\" does not, whenever it is used, mean the same thing, as\\r\\n\"john\" or \"st. paul\\'s\" does; it means a different period of time on\\r\\neach different day. it follows that the habit which constitutes\\r\\nour understanding of the words \"this morning\" is not the habit of\\r\\nassociating the words with a fixed object, but the habit of associating\\r\\nthem with something having a fixed time-relation to our present. this\\r\\nmorning has, to-day, the same time-relation to my present that yesterday\\r\\nmorning had yesterday. in order to understand the phrase \"this morning\"\\r\\nit is necessary that we should have a way of feeling time-intervals,\\r\\nand that this feeling should give what is constant in the meaning of the\\r\\nwords \"this morning.\" this appreciation of time-intervals is, however,\\r\\nobviously a product of memory, not a presupposition of it. it will be\\r\\nbetter, therefore, if we wish to analyse the causation of memory by\\r\\nsomething not presupposing memory, to take some other instance than that\\r\\nof a question about \"this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take the case of coming into a familiar room where something has\\r\\nbeen changed--say a new picture hung on the wall. we may at first\\r\\nhave only a sense that something is unfamiliar, but presently we shall\\r\\nremember, and say \"that picture was not on the wall before.\" in order to\\r\\nmake the case definite, we will suppose that we were only in the room\\r\\non one former occasion. in this case it seems fairly clear what happens.\\r\\nthe other objects in the room are associated, through the former\\r\\noccasion, with a blank space of wall where now there is a picture. they\\r\\ncall up an image of a blank wall, which clashes with perception of the\\r\\npicture. the image is associated with the belief-feeling which we found\\r\\nto be distinctive of memory, since it can neither be abolished nor\\r\\nharmonized with perception. if the room had remained unchanged, we\\r\\nmight have had only the feeling of familiarity without the definite\\r\\nremembering; it is the change that drives us from the present to memory\\r\\nof the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may generalize this instance so as to cover the causes of many\\r\\nmemories. some present feature of the environment is associated, through\\r\\npast experiences, with something now absent; this absent something comes\\r\\nbefore us as an image, and is contrasted with present sensation. in\\r\\ncases of this sort, habit (or association) explains why the present\\r\\nfeature of the environment brings up the memory-image, but it does\\r\\nnot explain the memory-belief. perhaps a more complete analysis could\\r\\nexplain the memory-belief also on lines of association and habit, but\\r\\nthe causes of beliefs are obscure, and we cannot investigate them\\r\\nyet. for the present we must content ourselves with the fact that the\\r\\nmemory-image can be explained by habit. as regards the memory-belief,\\r\\nwe must, at least provisionally, accept bergson\\'s view that it cannot be\\r\\nbrought under the head of habit, at any rate when it first occurs, i.e.\\r\\nwhen we remember something we never remembered before.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe must now consider somewhat more closely the content of a\\r\\nmemory-belief. the memory-belief confers upon the memory-image something\\r\\nwhich we may call \"meaning;\" it makes us feel that the image points to\\r\\nan object which existed in the past. in order to deal with this topic\\r\\nwe must consider the verbal expression of the memory-belief. we might\\r\\nbe tempted to put the memory-belief into the words: \"something like\\r\\nthis image occurred.\" but such words would be very far from an accurate\\r\\ntranslation of the simplest kind of memory-belief. \"something like this\\r\\nimage\" is a very complicated conception. in the simplest kind of memory\\r\\nwe are not aware of the difference between an image and the sensation\\r\\nwhich it copies, which may be called its \"prototype.\" when the image\\r\\nis before us, we judge rather \"this occurred.\" the image is not\\r\\ndistinguished from the object which existed in the past: the word \"this\"\\r\\ncovers both, and enables us to have a memory-belief which does not\\r\\nintroduce the complicated notion \"something like this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nit might be objected that, if we judge \"this occurred\" when in fact\\r\\n\"this\" is a present image, we judge falsely, and the memory-belief,\\r\\nso interpreted, becomes deceptive. this, however, would be a mistake,\\r\\nproduced by attempting to give to words a precision which they do not\\r\\npossess when used by unsophisticated people. it is true that the image\\r\\nis not absolutely identical with its prototype, and if the word \"this\"\\r\\nmeant the image to the exclusion of everything else, the judgment \"this\\r\\noccurred\" would be false. but identity is a precise conception, and no\\r\\nword, in ordinary speech, stands for anything precise. ordinary speech\\r\\ndoes not distinguish between identity and close similarity. a word\\r\\nalways applies, not only to one particular, but to a group of associated\\r\\nparticulars, which are not recognized as multiple in common thought or\\r\\nspeech. thus primitive memory, when it judges that \"this occurred,\" is\\r\\nvague, but not false.\\r\\n\\r\\nvague identity, which is really close similarity, has been a source\\r\\nof many of the confusions by which philosophy has lived. of a vague\\r\\nsubject, such as a \"this,\" which is both an image and its prototype,\\r\\ncontradictory predicates are true simultaneously: this existed and does\\r\\nnot exist, since it is a thing remembered, but also this exists and did\\r\\nnot exist, since it is a present image. hence bergson\\'s\\r\\ninterpenetration of the present by the past, hegelian continuity and\\r\\nidentity-in-diversity, and a host of other notions which are thought to\\r\\nbe profound because they are obscure and confused. the contradictions\\r\\nresulting from confounding image and prototype in memory force us to\\r\\nprecision. but when we become precise, our remembering becomes different\\r\\nfrom that of ordinary life, and if we forget this we shall go wrong in\\r\\nthe analysis of ordinary memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nvagueness and accuracy are important notions, which it is very necessary\\r\\nto understand. both are a matter of degree. all thinking is vague\\r\\nto some extent, and complete accuracy is a theoretical ideal not\\r\\npractically attainable. to understand what is meant by accuracy, it will\\r\\nbe well to consider first instruments of measurement, such as a balance\\r\\nor a thermometer. these are said to be accurate when they give different\\r\\nresults for very slightly different stimuli.* a clinical thermometer\\r\\nis accurate when it enables us to detect very slight differences in the\\r\\ntemperature of the blood. we may say generally that an instrument\\r\\nis accurate in proportion as it reacts differently to very slightly\\r\\ndifferent stimuli. when a small difference of stimulus produces a great\\r\\ndifference of reaction, the instrument is accurate; in the contrary case\\r\\nit is not.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. the\\r\\n     subject of accuracy and vagueness will be considered again\\r\\n     in lecture xiii.\\r\\n\\r\\nexactly the same thing applies in defining accuracy of thought\\r\\nor perception. a musician will respond differently to very minute\\r\\ndifferences in playing which would be quite imperceptible to the\\r\\nordinary mortal. a negro can see the difference between one negro and\\r\\nanother one is his friend, another his enemy. but to us such different\\r\\nresponses are impossible: we can merely apply the word \"negro\"\\r\\nindiscriminately. accuracy of response in regard to any particular kind\\r\\nof stimulus is improved by practice. understanding a language is a\\r\\ncase in point. few frenchmen can hear any difference between the sounds\\r\\n\"hall\" and \"hole,\" which produce quite different impressions upon us.\\r\\nthe two statements \"the hall is full of water\" and \"the hole is full\\r\\nof water\" call for different responses, and a hearing which cannot\\r\\ndistinguish between them is inaccurate or vague in this respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nprecision and vagueness in thought, as in perception, depend upon the\\r\\ndegree of difference between responses to more or less similar stimuli.\\r\\nin the case of thought, the response does not follow immediately upon\\r\\nthe sensational stimulus, but that makes no difference as regards our\\r\\npresent question. thus to revert to memory: a memory is \"vague\" when\\r\\nit is appropriate to many different occurrences: for instance, \"i met a\\r\\nman\" is vague, since any man would verify it. a memory is \"precise\" when\\r\\nthe occurrences that would verify it are narrowly circumscribed: for\\r\\ninstance, \"i met jones\" is precise as compared to \"i met a man.\" a\\r\\nmemory is \"accurate\" when it is both precise and true, i.e. in the above\\r\\ninstance, if it was jones i met. it is precise even if it is false,\\r\\nprovided some very definite occurrence would have been required to make\\r\\nit true.\\r\\n\\r\\nit follows from what has been said that a vague thought has more\\r\\nlikelihood of being true than a precise one. to try and hit an object\\r\\nwith a vague thought is like trying to hit the bull\\'s eye with a lump of\\r\\nputty: when the putty reaches the target, it flattens out all over it,\\r\\nand probably covers the bull\\'s eye along with the rest. to try and hit\\r\\nan object with a precise thought is like trying to hit the bull\\'s\\r\\neye with a bullet. the advantage of the precise thought is that it\\r\\ndistinguishes between the bull\\'s eye and the rest of the target. for\\r\\nexample, if the whole target is represented by the fungus family and the\\r\\nbull\\'s eye by mushrooms, a vague thought which can only hit the target\\r\\nas a whole is not much use from a culinary point of view. and when i\\r\\nmerely remember that i met a man, my memory may be very inadequate to my\\r\\npractical requirements, since it may make a great difference whether i\\r\\nmet brown or jones. the memory \"i met jones\" is relatively precise. it\\r\\nis accurate if i met jones, inaccurate if i met brown, but precise in\\r\\neither case as against the mere recollection that i met a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe distinction between accuracy and precision is however, not\\r\\nfundamental. we may omit precision from out thoughts and confine\\r\\nourselves to the distinction between accuracy and vagueness. we may then\\r\\nset up the following definitions:\\r\\n\\r\\nan instrument is \"reliable\" with respect to a given set of stimuli when\\r\\nto stimuli which are not relevantly different it gives always responses\\r\\nwhich are not relevantly different.\\r\\n\\r\\nan instrument is a \"measure\" of a set of stimuli which are serially\\r\\nordered when its responses, in all cases where they are relevantly\\r\\ndifferent, are arranged in a series in the same order.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe \"degree of accuracy\" of an instrument which is a reliable measurer\\r\\nis the ratio of the difference of response to the difference of stimulus\\r\\nin cases where the difference of stimulus is small.* that is to say, if\\r\\na small difference of stimulus produces a great difference of response,\\r\\nthe instrument is very accurate; in the contrary case, very inaccurate.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * strictly speaking, the limit of this, i.e. the derivative\\r\\n     of the response with respect to the stimulus.\\r\\n\\r\\na mental response is called \"vague\" in proportion to its lack of\\r\\naccuracy, or rather precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese definitions will be found useful, not only in the case of memory,\\r\\nbut in almost all questions concerned with knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nit should be observed that vague beliefs, so far from being necessarily\\r\\nfalse, have a better chance of truth than precise ones, though their\\r\\ntruth is less valuable than that of precise beliefs, since they do not\\r\\ndistinguish between occurrences which may differ in important ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole of the above discussion of vagueness and accuracy was\\r\\noccasioned by the attempt to interpret the word \"this\" when we judge in\\r\\nverbal memory that \"this occurred.\" the word \"this,\" in such a judgment,\\r\\nis a vague word, equally applicable to the present memory-image and to\\r\\nthe past occurrence which is its prototype. a vague word is not to be\\r\\nidentified with a general word, though in practice the distinction\\r\\nmay often be blurred. a word is general when it is understood to be\\r\\napplicable to a number of different objects in virtue of some common\\r\\nproperty. a word is vague when it is in fact applicable to a number of\\r\\ndifferent objects because, in virtue of some common property, they\\r\\nhave not appeared, to the person using the word, to be distinct. i\\r\\nemphatically do not mean that he has judged them to be identical, but\\r\\nmerely that he has made the same response to them all and has not judged\\r\\nthem to be different. we may compare a vague word to a jelly and\\r\\na general word to a heap of shot. vague words precede judgments\\r\\nof identity and difference; both general and particular words are\\r\\nsubsequent to such judgments. the word \"this\" in the primitive\\r\\nmemory-belief is a vague word, not a general word; it covers both the\\r\\nimage and its prototype because the two are not distinguished.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * on the vague and the general cf. ribot: \"evolution of\\r\\n     general ideas,\" open court co., 1899, p. 32: \"the sole\\r\\n     permissible formula is this: intelligence progresses from\\r\\n     the indefinite to the definite. if \\'indefinite\\' is taken as\\r\\n     synonymous with general, it may be said that the particular\\r\\n     does not appear at the outset, but neither does the general\\r\\n     in any exact sense: the vague would be more appropriate. in\\r\\n     other words, no sooner has the intellect progressed beyond\\r\\n     the moment of perception and of its immediate reproduction\\r\\n     in memory, than the generic image makes its appearance, i.e.\\r\\n     a state intermediate between the particular and the general,\\r\\n     participating in the nature of the one and of the other--a\\r\\n     confused simplification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut we have not yet finished our analysis of the memory-belief. the\\r\\ntense in the belief that \"this occurred\" is provided by the nature of\\r\\nthe belief-feeling involved in memory; the word \"this,\" as we have seen,\\r\\nhas a vagueness which we have tried to describe. but we must still ask\\r\\nwhat we mean by \"occurred.\" the image is, in one sense, occurring now;\\r\\nand therefore we must find some other sense in which the past event\\r\\noccurred but the image does not occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two distinct questions to be asked: (1) what causes us to say\\r\\nthat a thing occurs? (2) what are we feeling when we say this? as to the\\r\\nfirst question, in the crude use of the word, which is what concerns us,\\r\\nmemory-images would not be said to occur; they would not be noticed\\r\\nin themselves, but merely used as signs of the past event. images are\\r\\n\"merely imaginary\"; they have not, in crude thought, the sort of reality\\r\\nthat belongs to outside bodies. roughly speaking, \"real\" things would\\r\\nbe those that can cause sensations, those that have correlations of the\\r\\nsort that constitute physical objects. a thing is said to be \"real\"\\r\\nor to \"occur\" when it fits into a context of such correlations. the\\r\\nprototype of our memory-image did fit into a physical context, while\\r\\nour memory-image does not. this causes us to feel that the prototype was\\r\\n\"real,\" while the image is \"imaginary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the answer to our second question, namely as to what we are feeling\\r\\nwhen we say a thing \"occurs\" or is \"real,\" must be somewhat different.\\r\\nwe do not, unless we are unusually reflective, think about the presence\\r\\nor absence of correlations: we merely have different feelings which,\\r\\nintellectualized, may be represented as expectations of the presence\\r\\nor absence of correlations. a thing which \"feels real\" inspires us with\\r\\nhopes or fears, expectations or curiosities, which are wholly absent\\r\\nwhen a thing \"feels imaginary.\" the feeling of reality is a feeling akin\\r\\nto respect: it belongs primarily to whatever can do things to us without\\r\\nour voluntary co-operation. this feeling of reality, related to\\r\\nthe memory-image, and referred to the past by the specific kind of\\r\\nbelief-feeling that is characteristic of memory, seems to be what\\r\\nconstitutes the act of remembering in its pure form.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now summarize our analysis of pure memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nmemory demands (a) an image, (b) a belief in past existence. the belief\\r\\nmay be expressed in the words \"this existed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe belief, like every other, may be analysed into (1) the believing,\\r\\n(2) what is believed. the believing is a specific feeling or sensation\\r\\nor complex of sensations, different from expectation or bare assent in\\r\\na way that makes the belief refer to the past; the reference to the\\r\\npast lies in the belief-feeling, not in the content believed. there is\\r\\na relation between the belief-feeling and the content, making the\\r\\nbelief-feeling refer to the content, and expressed by saying that the\\r\\ncontent is what is believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe content believed may or may not be expressed in words. let us\\r\\ntake first the case when it is not. in that case, if we are merely\\r\\nremembering that something of which we now have an image occurred,\\r\\nthe content consists of (a) the image, (b) the feeling, analogous\\r\\nto respect, which we translate by saying that something is \"real\" as\\r\\nopposed to \"imaginary,\" (c) a relation between the image and the feeling\\r\\nof reality, of the sort expressed when we say that the feeling refers\\r\\nto the image. this content does not contain in itself any\\r\\ntime-determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe time-determination lies in the nature of the belief feeling, which\\r\\nis that called \"remembering\" or (better) \"recollecting.\" it is only\\r\\nsubsequent reflection upon this reference to the past that makes us\\r\\nrealize the distinction between the image and the event recollected.\\r\\nwhen we have made this distinction, we can say that the image \"means\"\\r\\nthe past event.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe content expressed in words is best represented by the words \"the\\r\\nexistence of this,\" since these words do not involve tense, which\\r\\nbelongs to the belief-feeling, not to the content. here \"this\" is\\r\\na vague term, covering the memory-image and anything very like it,\\r\\nincluding its prototype. \"existence\" expresses the feeling of a\\r\\n\"reality\" aroused primarily by whatever can have effects upon us without\\r\\nour voluntary co-operation. the word \"of\" in the phrase \"the existence\\r\\nof this\" represents the relation which subsists between the feeling of\\r\\nreality and the \"this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis analysis of memory is probably extremely faulty, but i do not know\\r\\nhow to improve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nnote.-when i speak of a feeling of belief, i use the word \"feeling\" in\\r\\na popular sense, to cover a sensation or an image or a complex of\\r\\nsensations or images or both; i use this word because i do not wish to\\r\\ncommit myself to any special analysis of the belief-feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture x. words and meaning\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem with which we shall be concerned in this lecture is the\\r\\nproblem of determining what is the relation called \"meaning.\" the word\\r\\n\"napoleon,\" we say, \"means\" a certain person. in saying this, we are\\r\\nasserting a relation between the word \"napoleon\" and the person so\\r\\ndesignated. it is this relation that we must now investigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us first consider what sort of object a word is when considered\\r\\nsimply as a physical thing, apart from its meaning. to begin with, there\\r\\nare many instances of a word, namely all the different occasions when it\\r\\nis employed. thus a word is not something unique and particular, but a\\r\\nset of occurrences. if we confine ourselves to spoken words, a word has\\r\\ntwo aspects, according as we regard it from the point of view of the\\r\\nspeaker or from that of the hearer. from the point of view of the\\r\\nspeaker, a single instance of the use of a word consists of a certain\\r\\nset of movements in the throat and mouth, combined with breath. from\\r\\nthe point of view of the hearer, a single instance of the use of a\\r\\nword consists of a certain series of sounds, each being approximately\\r\\nrepresented by a single letter in writing, though in practice a letter\\r\\nmay represent several sounds, or several letters may represent one\\r\\nsound. the connection between the spoken word and the word as it reaches\\r\\nthe hearer is causal. let us confine ourselves to the spoken word, which\\r\\nis the more important for the analysis of what is called \"thought.\"\\r\\nthen we may say that a single instance of the spoken word consists of\\r\\na series of movements, and the word consists of a whole set of such\\r\\nseries, each member of the set being very similar to each other member.\\r\\nthat is to say, any two instances of the word \"napoleon\" are very\\r\\nsimilar, and each instance consists of a series of movements in the\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\na single word, accordingly, is by no means simple it is a class of\\r\\nsimilar series of movements (confining ourselves still to the spoken\\r\\nword). the degree of similarity required cannot be precisely defined:\\r\\na man may pronounce the word \"napoleon\" so badly that it can hardly be\\r\\ndetermined whether he has really pronounced it or not. the instances\\r\\nof a word shade off into other movements by imperceptible degrees. and\\r\\nexactly analogous observations apply to words heard or written or read.\\r\\nbut in what has been said so far we have not even broached the\\r\\nquestion of the definition of a word, since \"meaning\" is clearly what\\r\\ndistinguishes a word from other sets of similar movements, and \"meaning\"\\r\\nremains to be defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is natural to think of the meaning of a word as something\\r\\nconventional. this, however, is only true with great limitations. a new\\r\\nword can be added to an existing language by a mere convention, as\\r\\nis done, for instance, with new scientific terms. but the basis of\\r\\na language is not conventional, either from the point of view of the\\r\\nindividual or from that of the community. a child learning to speak is\\r\\nlearning habits and associations which are just as much determined by\\r\\nthe environment as the habit of expecting dogs to bark and cocks to\\r\\ncrow. the community that speaks a language has learnt it, and modified\\r\\nit by processes almost all of which are not deliberate, but the results\\r\\nof causes operating according to more or less ascertainable laws. if\\r\\nwe trace any indo-european language back far enough, we arrive\\r\\nhypothetically (at any rate according to some authorities) at the stage\\r\\nwhen language consisted only of the roots out of which subsequent words\\r\\nhave grown. how these roots acquired their meanings is not known, but a\\r\\nconventional origin is clearly just as mythical as the social contract\\r\\nby which hobbes and rousseau supposed civil government to have been\\r\\nestablished. we can hardly suppose a parliament of hitherto speechless\\r\\nelders meeting together and agreeing to call a cow a cow and a wolf a\\r\\nwolf. the association of words with their meanings must have grown up\\r\\nby some natural process, though at present the nature of the process is\\r\\nunknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nspoken and written words are, of course, not the only way of conveying\\r\\nmeaning. a large part of one of wundt\\'s two vast volumes on language in\\r\\nhis \"volkerpsychologie\" is concerned with gesture-language. ants appear\\r\\nto be able to communicate a certain amount of information by means of\\r\\ntheir antennae. probably writing itself, which we now regard as merely\\r\\na way of representing speech, was originally an independent language,\\r\\nas it has remained to this day in china. writing seems to have consisted\\r\\noriginally of pictures, which gradually became conventionalized, coming\\r\\nin time to represent syllables, and finally letters on the telephone\\r\\nprinciple of \"t for tommy.\" but it would seem that writing nowhere\\r\\nbegan as an attempt to represent speech it began as a direct pictorial\\r\\nrepresentation of what was to be expressed. the essence of language\\r\\nlies, not in the use of this or that special means of communication,\\r\\nbut in the employment of fixed associations (however these may have\\r\\noriginated) in order that something now sensible--a spoken word, a\\r\\npicture, a gesture, or what not--may call up the \"idea\" of something\\r\\nelse. whenever this is done, what is now sensible may be called a \"sign\"\\r\\nor \"symbol,\" and that of which it is intended to call up the \"idea\" may\\r\\nbe called its \"meaning.\" this is a rough outline of what constitutes\\r\\n\"meaning.\" but we must fill in the outline in various ways. and,\\r\\nsince we are concerned with what is called \"thought,\" we must pay more\\r\\nattention than we otherwise should do to the private as opposed to the\\r\\nsocial use of language. language profoundly affects our thoughts, and\\r\\nit is this aspect of language that is of most importance to us in our\\r\\npresent inquiry. we are almost more concerned with the internal speech\\r\\nthat is never uttered than we are with the things said out loud to other\\r\\npeople.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we ask what constitutes meaning, we are not asking what is the\\r\\nmeaning of this or that particular word. the word \"napoleon\" means a\\r\\ncertain individual; but we are asking, not who is the individual meant,\\r\\nbut what is the relation of the word to the individual which makes the\\r\\none mean the other. but just as it is useful to realize the nature of a\\r\\nword as part of the physical world, so it is useful to realize the sort\\r\\nof thing that a word may mean. when we are clear both as to what a word\\r\\nis in its physical aspect, and as to what sort of thing it can mean, we\\r\\nare in a better position to discover the relation of the two which is\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe things that words mean differ more than words do. there are\\r\\ndifferent sorts of words, distinguished by the grammarians; and there\\r\\nare logical distinctions, which are connected to some extent, though not\\r\\nso closely as was formerly supposed, with the grammatical distinctions\\r\\nof parts of speech. it is easy, however, to be misled by grammar,\\r\\nparticularly if all the languages we know belong to one family. in some\\r\\nlanguages, according to some authorities, the distinction of parts of\\r\\nspeech does not exist; in many languages it is widely different from\\r\\nthat to which we are accustomed in the indo-european languages. these\\r\\nfacts have to be borne in mind if we are to avoid giving metaphysical\\r\\nimportance to mere accidents of our own speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nin considering what words mean, it is natural to start with proper\\r\\nnames, and we will again take \"napoleon\" as our instance. we commonly\\r\\nimagine, when we use a proper name, that we mean one definite entity,\\r\\nthe particular individual who was called \"napoleon.\" but what we know\\r\\nas a person is not simple. there may be a single simple ego which was\\r\\nnapoleon, and remained strictly identical from his birth to his death.\\r\\nthere is no way of proving that this cannot be the case, but there is\\r\\nalso not the slightest reason to suppose that it is the case. napoleon\\r\\nas he was empirically known consisted of a series of gradually changing\\r\\nappearances: first a squalling baby, then a boy, then a slim and\\r\\nbeautiful youth, then a fat and slothful person very magnificently\\r\\ndressed this series of appearances, and various occurrences having\\r\\ncertain kinds of causal connections with them, constitute napoleon as\\r\\nempirically known, and therefore are napoleon in so far as he forms\\r\\npart of the experienced world. napoleon is a complicated series of\\r\\noccurrences, bound together by causal laws, not, like instances of a\\r\\nword, by similarities. for although a person changes gradually, and\\r\\npresents similar appearances on two nearly contemporaneous occasions,\\r\\nit is not these similarities that constitute the person, as appears from\\r\\nthe \"comedy of errors\" for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus in the case of a proper name, while the word is a set of similar\\r\\nseries of movements, what it means is a series of occurrences bound\\r\\ntogether by causal laws of that special kind that makes the occurrences\\r\\ntaken together constitute what we call one person, or one animal or\\r\\nthing, in case the name applies to an animal or thing instead of to\\r\\na person. neither the word nor what it names is one of the ultimate\\r\\nindivisible constituents of the world. in language there is no direct\\r\\nway of designating one of the ultimate brief existents that go to make\\r\\nup the collections we call things or persons. if we want to speak of\\r\\nsuch existents--which hardly happens except in philosophy--we have to do\\r\\nit by means of some elaborate phrase, such as \"the visual sensation\\r\\nwhich occupied the centre of my field of vision at noon on january 1,\\r\\n1919.\" such ultimate simples i call \"particulars.\" particulars might\\r\\nhave proper names, and no doubt would have if language had been invented\\r\\nby scientifically trained observers for purposes of philosophy and\\r\\nlogic. but as language was invented for practical ends, particulars have\\r\\nremained one and all without a name.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are not, in practice, much concerned with the actual particulars\\r\\nthat come into our experience in sensation; we are concerned rather\\r\\nwith whole systems to which the particulars belong and of which they\\r\\nare signs. what we see makes us say \"hullo, there\\'s jones,\" and the fact\\r\\nthat what we see is a sign of jones (which is the case because it is one\\r\\nof the particulars that make up jones) is more interesting to us than\\r\\nthe actual particular itself. hence we give the name \"jones\" to the\\r\\nwhole set of particulars, but do not trouble to give separate names to\\r\\nthe separate particulars that make up the set.\\r\\n\\r\\npassing on from proper names, we come next to general names, such as\\r\\n\"man,\" \"cat,\" \"triangle.\" a word such as \"man\" means a whole class\\r\\nof such collections of particulars as have proper names. the several\\r\\nmembers of the class are assembled together in virtue of some similarity\\r\\nor common property. all men resemble each other in certain important\\r\\nrespects; hence we want a word which shall be equally applicable to all\\r\\nof them. we only give proper names to the individuals of a species when\\r\\nthey differ inter se in practically important respects. in other cases\\r\\nwe do not do this. a poker, for instance, is just a poker; we do not\\r\\ncall one \"john\" and another \"peter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a large class of words, such as \"eating,\" \"walking,\"\\r\\n\"speaking,\" which mean a set of similar occurrences. two instances of\\r\\nwalking have the same name because they resemble each other, whereas\\r\\ntwo instances of jones have the same name because they are causally\\r\\nconnected. in practice, however, it is difficult to make any precise\\r\\ndistinction between a word such as \"walking\" and a general name such as\\r\\n\"man.\" one instance of walking cannot be concentrated into an instant:\\r\\nit is a process in time, in which there is a causal connection between\\r\\nthe earlier and later parts, as between the earlier and later parts\\r\\nof jones. thus an instance of walking differs from an instance of man\\r\\nsolely by the fact that it has a shorter life. there is a notion that an\\r\\ninstance of walking, as compared with jones, is unsubstantial, but this\\r\\nseems to be a mistake. we think that jones walks, and that there could\\r\\nnot be any walking unless there were somebody like jones to perform\\r\\nthe walking. but it is equally true that there could be no jones unless\\r\\nthere were something like walking for him to do. the notion that actions\\r\\nare performed by an agent is liable to the same kind of criticism as\\r\\nthe notion that thinking needs a subject or ego, which we rejected in\\r\\nlecture i. to say that it is jones who is walking is merely to say that\\r\\nthe walking in question is part of the whole series of occurrences which\\r\\nis jones. there is no logical impossibility in walking occurring as an\\r\\nisolated phenomenon, not forming part of any such series as we call a\\r\\n\"person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may therefore class with \"eating,\" \"walking,\" \"speaking\" words\\r\\nsuch as \"rain,\" \"sunrise,\" \"lightning,\" which do not denote what would\\r\\ncommonly be called actions. these words illustrate, incidentally, how\\r\\nlittle we can trust to the grammatical distinction of parts of speech,\\r\\nsince the substantive \"rain\" and the verb \"to rain\" denote precisely the\\r\\nsame class of meteorological occurrences. the distinction between the\\r\\nclass of objects denoted by such a word and the class of objects denoted\\r\\nby a general name such as \"man,\" \"vegetable,\" or \"planet,\" is that the\\r\\nsort of object which is an instance of (say) \"lightning\" is much simpler\\r\\nthan (say) an individual man. (i am speaking of lightning as a sensible\\r\\nphenomenon, not as it is described in physics.) the distinction is one\\r\\nof degree, not of kind. but there is, from the point of view of ordinary\\r\\nthought, a great difference between a process which, like a flash of\\r\\nlightning, can be wholly comprised within one specious present and a\\r\\nprocess which, like the life of a man, has to be pieced together by\\r\\nobservation and memory and the apprehension of causal connections.\\r\\nwe may say broadly, therefore, that a word of the kind we have been\\r\\ndiscussing denotes a set of similar occurrences, each (as a rule) much\\r\\nmore brief and less complex than a person or thing. words themselves, as\\r\\nwe have seen, are sets of similar occurrences of this kind. thus there\\r\\nis more logical affinity between a word and what it means in the case of\\r\\nwords of our present sort than in any other case.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is no very great difference between such words as we have just\\r\\nbeen considering and words denoting qualities, such as \"white\" or\\r\\n\"round.\" the chief difference is that words of this latter sort do not\\r\\ndenote processes, however brief, but static features of the world. snow\\r\\nfalls, and is white; the falling is a process, the whiteness is not.\\r\\nwhether there is a universal, called \"whiteness,\" or whether white\\r\\nthings are to be defined as those having a certain kind of similarity to\\r\\na standard thing, say freshly fallen snow, is a question which need\\r\\nnot concern us, and which i believe to be strictly insoluble. for our\\r\\npurposes, we may take the word \"white\" as denoting a certain set of\\r\\nsimilar particulars or collections of particulars, the similarity being\\r\\nin respect of a static quality, not of a process.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the logical point of view, a very important class of words\\r\\nare those that express relations, such as \"in,\" \"above,\" \"before,\"\\r\\n\"greater,\" and so on. the meaning of one of these words differs very\\r\\nfundamentally from the meaning of one of any of our previous classes,\\r\\nbeing more abstract and logically simpler than any of them. if our\\r\\nbusiness were logic, we should have to spend much time on these words.\\r\\nbut as it is psychology that concerns us, we will merely note their\\r\\nspecial character and pass on, since the logical classification of words\\r\\nis not our main business.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will consider next the question what is implied by saying that a\\r\\nperson \"understands\" a word, in the sense in which one understands\\r\\na word in one\\'s own language, but not in a language of which one is\\r\\nignorant. we may say that a person understands a word when (a) suitable\\r\\ncircumstances make him use it, (b) the hearing of it causes suitable\\r\\nbehaviour in him. we may call these two active and passive understanding\\r\\nrespectively. dogs often have passive understanding of some words, but\\r\\nnot active understanding, since they cannot use words.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not necessary, in order that a man should \"understand\" a word,\\r\\nthat he should \"know what it means,\" in the sense of being able to say\\r\\n\"this word means so-and-so.\" understanding words does not consist in\\r\\nknowing their dictionary definitions, or in being able to specify the\\r\\nobjects to which they are appropriate. such understanding as this may\\r\\nbelong to lexicographers and students, but not to ordinary mortals\\r\\nin ordinary life. understanding language is more like understanding\\r\\ncricket*: it is a matter of habits, acquired in oneself and rightly\\r\\npresumed in others. to say that a word has a meaning is not to say that\\r\\nthose who use the word correctly have ever thought out what the meaning\\r\\nis: the use of the word comes first, and the meaning is to be distilled\\r\\nout of it by observation and analysis. moreover, the meaning of a word\\r\\nis not absolutely definite: there is always a greater or less degree of\\r\\nvagueness. the meaning is an area, like a target: it may have a bull\\'s\\r\\neye, but the outlying parts of the target are still more or less within\\r\\nthe meaning, in a gradually diminishing degree as we travel further from\\r\\nthe bull\\'s eye. as language grows more precise, there is less and less\\r\\nof the target outside the bull\\'s eye, and the bull\\'s eye itself grows\\r\\nsmaller and smaller; but the bull\\'s eye never shrinks to a point, and\\r\\nthere is always a doubtful region, however small, surrounding it.**\\r\\n\\r\\n     * this point of view, extended to the analysis of \"thought\"\\r\\n     is urged with great force by j. b. watson, both in his\\r\\n     \"behavior,\" and in \"psychology from the standpoint of a\\r\\n     behaviorist\" (lippincott. 1919), chap. ix.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** on the understanding of words, a very admirable little\\r\\n     book is ribot\\'s \"evolution of general ideas,\" open court\\r\\n     co., 1899. ribot says (p. 131): \"we learn to understand a\\r\\n     concept as we learn to walk, dance, fence or play a musical\\r\\n     instrument: it is a habit, i.e. an organized memory. general\\r\\n     terms cover an organized, latent knowledge which is the\\r\\n     hidden capital without which we should be in a state of\\r\\n     bankruptcy, manipulating false money or paper of no value.\\r\\n     general ideas are habits in the intellectual order.\"\\r\\n\\r\\na word is used \"correctly\" when the average hearer will be affected\\r\\nby it in the way intended. this is a psychological, not a literary,\\r\\ndefinition of \"correctness.\" the literary definition would substitute,\\r\\nfor the average hearer, a person of high education living a long time\\r\\nago; the purpose of this definition is to make it difficult to speak or\\r\\nwrite correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe relation of a word to its meaning is of the nature of a causal law\\r\\ngoverning our use of the word and our actions when we hear it used.\\r\\nthere is no more reason why a person who uses a word correctly should\\r\\nbe able to tell what it means than there is why a planet which is moving\\r\\ncorrectly should know kepler\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nto illustrate what is meant by \"understanding\" words and sentences, let\\r\\nus take instances of various situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuppose you are walking in london with an absent-minded friend, and\\r\\nwhile crossing a street you say, \"look out, there\\'s a motor coming.\"\\r\\nhe will glance round and jump aside without the need of any \"mental\"\\r\\nintermediary. there need be no \"ideas,\" but only a stiffening of the\\r\\nmuscles, followed quickly by action. he \"understands\" the words, because\\r\\nhe does the right thing. such \"understanding\" may be taken to belong to\\r\\nthe nerves and brain, being habits which they have acquired while the\\r\\nlanguage was being learnt. thus understanding in this sense may be\\r\\nreduced to mere physiological causal laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you say the same thing to a frenchman with a slight knowledge of\\r\\nenglish he will go through some inner speech which may be represented by\\r\\n\"que dit-il? ah, oui, une automobile!\" after this, the rest follows as\\r\\nwith the englishman. watson would contend that the inner speech must be\\r\\nincipiently pronounced; we should argue that it might be merely imaged.\\r\\nbut this point is not important in the present connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you say the same thing to a child who does not yet know the word\\r\\n\"motor,\" but does know the other words you are using, you produce a\\r\\nfeeling of anxiety and doubt you will have to point and say, \"there,\\r\\nthat\\'s a motor.\" after that the child will roughly understand the word\\r\\n\"motor,\" though he may include trains and steam-rollers if this is the\\r\\nfirst time the child has heard the word \"motor,\" he may for a long time\\r\\ncontinue to recall this scene when he hears the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nso far we have found four ways of understanding words:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) on suitable occasions you use the word properly.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) when you hear it you act appropriately.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) you associate the word with another word (say in a different\\r\\nlanguage) which has the appropriate effect on behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) when the word is being first learnt, you may associate it with an\\r\\nobject, which is what it \"means,\" or a representative of various objects\\r\\nthat it \"means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nin the fourth case, the word acquires, through association, some of the\\r\\nsame causal efficacy as the object. the word \"motor\" can make you\\r\\nleap aside, just as the motor can, but it cannot break your bones. the\\r\\neffects which a word can share with its object are those which proceed\\r\\naccording to laws other than the general laws of physics, i.e. those\\r\\nwhich, according to our terminology, involve vital movements as opposed\\r\\nto merely mechanical movements. the effects of a word that we understand\\r\\nare always mnemic phenomena in the sense explained in lecture iv, in\\r\\nso far as they are identical with, or similar to, the effects which the\\r\\nobject itself might have.\\r\\n\\r\\nso far, all the uses of words that we have considered can be accounted\\r\\nfor on the lines of behaviourism.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut so far we have only considered what may be called the\\r\\n\"demonstrative\" use of language, to point out some feature in the\\r\\npresent environment. this is only one of the ways in which language\\r\\nmay be used. there are also its narrative and imaginative uses, as\\r\\nin history and novels. let us take as an instance the telling of some\\r\\nremembered event.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe spoke a moment ago of a child who hears the word \"motor\" for\\r\\nthe first time when crossing a street along which a motor-car is\\r\\napproaching. on a later occasion, we will suppose, the child remembers\\r\\nthe incident and relates it to someone else. in this case, both the\\r\\nactive and passive understanding of words is different from what it is\\r\\nwhen words are used demonstratively. the child is not seeing a motor,\\r\\nbut only remembering one; the hearer does not look round in expectation\\r\\nof seeing a motor coming, but \"understands\" that a motor came at some\\r\\nearlier time. the whole of this occurrence is much more difficult to\\r\\naccount for on behaviourist lines. it is clear that, in so far as the\\r\\nchild is genuinely remembering, he has a picture of the past occurrence,\\r\\nand his words are chosen so as to describe the picture; and in so far\\r\\nas the hearer is genuinely apprehending what is said, the hearer is\\r\\nacquiring a picture more or less like that of the child. it is true that\\r\\nthis process may be telescoped through the operation of the word-habit.\\r\\nthe child may not genuinely remember the incident, but only have the\\r\\nhabit of the appropriate words, as in the case of a poem which we know\\r\\nby heart, though we cannot remember learning it. and the hearer also\\r\\nmay only pay attention to the words, and not call up any corresponding\\r\\npicture. but it is, nevertheless, the possibility of a memory-image in\\r\\nthe child and an imagination-image in the hearer that makes the essence\\r\\nof the narrative \"meaning\" of the words. in so far as this is absent,\\r\\nthe words are mere counters, capable of meaning, but not at the moment\\r\\npossessing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nyet this might perhaps be regarded as something of an overstatement. the\\r\\nwords alone, without the use of images, may cause appropriate emotions\\r\\nand appropriate behaviour. the words have been used in an environment\\r\\nwhich produced certain emotions; by a telescoped process, the words\\r\\nalone are now capable of producing similar emotions. on these lines it\\r\\nmight be sought to show that images are unnecessary. i do not believe,\\r\\nhowever, that we could account on these lines for the entirely different\\r\\nresponse produced by a narrative and by a description of present facts.\\r\\nimages, as contrasted with sensations, are the response expected during\\r\\na narrative; it is understood that present action is not called\\r\\nfor. thus it seems that we must maintain our distinction words used\\r\\ndemonstratively describe and are intended to lead to sensations, while\\r\\nthe same words used in narrative describe and are only intended to lead\\r\\nto images.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have thus, in addition to our four previous ways in which words can\\r\\nmean, two new ways, namely the way of memory and the way of imagination.\\r\\nthat is to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) words may be used to describe or recall a memory-image: to describe\\r\\nit when it already exists, or to recall it when the words exist as a\\r\\nhabit and are known to be descriptive of some past experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n(6) words may be used to describe or create an imagination-image: to\\r\\ndescribe it, for example, in the case of a poet or novelist, or to\\r\\ncreate it in the ordinary case for giving information-though, in the\\r\\nlatter case, it is intended that the imagination-image, when created,\\r\\nshall be accompanied by belief that something of the sort occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese two ways of using words, including their occurrence in inner\\r\\nspeech, may be spoken of together as the use of words in \"thinking.\"\\r\\nif we are right, the use of words in thinking depends, at least in its\\r\\norigin, upon images, and cannot be fully dealt with on behaviourist\\r\\nlines. and this is really the most essential function of words, namely\\r\\nthat, originally through their connection with images, they bring us\\r\\ninto touch with what is remote in time or space. when they operate\\r\\nwithout the medium of images, this seems to be a telescoped process.\\r\\nthus the problem of the meaning of words is brought into connection with\\r\\nthe problem of the meaning of images.\\r\\n\\r\\nto understand the function that words perform in what is called\\r\\n\"thinking,\" we must understand both the causes and the effects of their\\r\\noccurrence. the causes of the occurrence of words require somewhat\\r\\ndifferent treatment according as the object designated by the word is\\r\\nsensibly present or absent. when the object is present, it may itself\\r\\nbe taken as the cause of the word, through association. but when it is\\r\\nabsent there is more difficulty in obtaining a behaviourist theory of\\r\\nthe occurrence of the word. the language-habit consists not merely\\r\\nin the use of words demonstratively, but also in their use to express\\r\\nnarrative or desire. professor watson, in his account of the acquisition\\r\\nof the language-habit, pays very little attention to the use of words in\\r\\nnarrative and desire. he says (\"behavior,\" pp. 329-330):\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the stimulus (object) to which the child often responds, a box, e.g. by\\r\\nmovements such as opening and closing and putting objects into it, may\\r\\nserve to illustrate our argument. the nurse, observing that the child\\r\\nreacts with his hands, feet, etc., to the box, begins to say \\'box\\' when\\r\\nthe child is handed the box, \\'open box\\' when the child opens it, \\'close\\r\\nbox\\' when he closes it, and \\'put doll in box\\' when that act is executed.\\r\\nthis is repeated over and over again. in the process of time it comes\\r\\nabout that without any other stimulus than that of the box which\\r\\noriginally called out the bodily habits, he begins to say \\'box\\' when he\\r\\nsees it, \\'open box\\' when he opens it, etc. the visible box now becomes\\r\\na stimulus capable of releasing either the bodily habits or the\\r\\nword-habit, i.e. development has brought about two things: (1) a series\\r\\nof functional connections among arcs which run from visual receptor to\\r\\nmuscles of throat, and (2) a series of already earlier connected arcs\\r\\nwhich run from the same receptor to the bodily muscles.... the object\\r\\nmeets the child\\'s vision. he runs to it and tries to reach it and says\\r\\n\\'box.\\'... finally the word is uttered without the movement of going\\r\\ntowards the box being executed.... habits are formed of going to the\\r\\nbox when the arms are full of toys. the child has been taught to deposit\\r\\nthem there. when his arms are laden with toys and no box is there, the\\r\\nword-habit arises and he calls \\'box\\'; it is handed to him, and he opens\\r\\nit and deposits the toys therein. this roughly marks what we would call\\r\\nthe genesis of a true language-habit.\"(pp. 329-330).*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * just the same account of language is given in professor\\r\\n     watson\\'s more recent book (reference above).\\r\\n\\r\\nwe need not linger over what is said in the above passage as to the use\\r\\nof the word \"box\" in the presence of the box. but as to its use in the\\r\\nabsence of the box, there is only one brief sentence, namely: \"when his\\r\\narms are laden with toys and no box is there, the word-habit arises and\\r\\nhe calls \\'box.\\'\" this is inadequate as it stands, since the habit has\\r\\nbeen to use the word when the box is present, and we have to explain its\\r\\nextension to cases in which the box is absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving admitted images, we may say that the word \"box,\" in the absence\\r\\nof the box, is caused by an image of the box. this may or may not\\r\\nbe true--in fact, it is true in some cases but not in others. even,\\r\\nhowever, if it were true in all cases, it would only slightly shift our\\r\\nproblem: we should now have to ask what causes an image of the box to\\r\\narise. we might be inclined to say that desire for the box is the cause.\\r\\nbut when this view is investigated, it is found that it compels us to\\r\\nsuppose that the box can be desired without the child\\'s having either an\\r\\nimage of the box or the word \"box.\" this will require a theory of desire\\r\\nwhich may be, and i think is, in the main true, but which removes desire\\r\\nfrom among things that actually occur, and makes it merely a convenient\\r\\nfiction, like force in mechanics.* with such a view, desire is no longer\\r\\na true cause, but merely a short way of describing certain processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * see lecture iii, above.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to explain the occurrence of either the word or the image\\r\\nin the absence of the box, we have to assume that there is something,\\r\\neither in the environment or in our own sensations, which has frequently\\r\\noccurred at about the same time as the word \"box.\" one of the laws which\\r\\ndistinguish psychology (or nerve-physiology?) from physics is the\\r\\nlaw that, when two things have frequently existed in close temporal\\r\\ncontiguity, either comes in time to cause the other.* this is the basis\\r\\nboth of habit and of association. thus, in our case, the arms full of\\r\\ntoys have frequently been followed quickly by the box, and the box in\\r\\nturn by the word \"box.\" the box itself is subject to physical laws, and\\r\\ndoes not tend to be caused by the arms full of toys, however often it\\r\\nmay in the past have followed them--always provided that, in the case in\\r\\nquestion, its physical position is such that voluntary movements cannot\\r\\nlead to it. but the word \"box\" and the image of the box are subject to\\r\\nthe law of habit; hence it is possible for either to be caused by the\\r\\narms full of toys. and we may lay it down generally that, whenever we\\r\\nuse a word, either aloud or in inner speech, there is some sensation\\r\\nor image (either of which may be itself a word) which has frequently\\r\\noccurred at about the same time as the word, and now, through habit,\\r\\ncauses the word. it follows that the law of habit is adequate to account\\r\\nfor the use of words in the absence of their objects; moreover, it would\\r\\nbe adequate even without introducing images. although, therefore, images\\r\\nseem undeniable, we cannot derive an additional argument in their favour\\r\\nfrom the use of words, which could, theoretically, be explained without\\r\\nintroducing images.\\r\\n\\r\\n     *for a more exact statement of this law, with the\\r\\n     limitations suggested by experiment, see a. wohlgemuth, \"on\\r\\n     memory and the direction of associations,\" \"british journal\\r\\n     of psychology,\" vol. v, part iv (march, 1913).\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we understand a word, there is a reciprocal association between\\r\\nit and the images of what it \"means.\" images may cause us to use words\\r\\nwhich mean them, and these words, heard or read, may in turn cause the\\r\\nappropriate images. thus speech is a means of producing in our hearers\\r\\nthe images which are in us. also, by a telescoped process, words come in\\r\\ntime to produce directly the effects which would have been produced\\r\\nby the images with which they were associated. the general law of\\r\\ntelescoped processes is that, if a causes b and b causes c, it will\\r\\nhappen in time that a will cause c directly, without the intermediary\\r\\nof b. this is a characteristic of psychological and neural causation.\\r\\nin virtue of this law, the effects of images upon our actions come to\\r\\nbe produced by words, even when the words do not call up appropriate\\r\\nimages. the more familiar we are with words, the more our \"thinking\"\\r\\ngoes on in words instead of images. we may, for example, be able to\\r\\ndescribe a person\\'s appearance correctly without having at any time had\\r\\nany image of him, provided, when we saw him, we thought of words which\\r\\nfitted him; the words alone may remain with us as a habit, and enable\\r\\nus to speak as if we could recall a visual image of the man. in this and\\r\\nother ways the understanding of a word often comes to be quite free from\\r\\nimagery; but in first learning the use of language it would seem that\\r\\nimagery always plays a very important part.\\r\\n\\r\\nimages as well as words may be said to have \"meaning\"; indeed, the\\r\\nmeaning of images seems more primitive than the meaning of words. what\\r\\nwe call (say) an image of st. paul\\'s may be said to \"mean\" st. paul\\'s.\\r\\nbut it is not at all easy to say exactly what constitutes the meaning of\\r\\nan image. a memory-image of a particular occurrence, when accompanied\\r\\nby a memory-belief, may be said to mean the occurrence of which it is an\\r\\nimage. but most actual images do not have this degree of definiteness.\\r\\nif we call up an image of a dog, we are very likely to have a vague\\r\\nimage, which is not representative of some one special dog, but of dogs\\r\\nin general. when we call up an image of a friend\\'s face, we are not\\r\\nlikely to reproduce the expression he had on some one particular\\r\\noccasion, but rather a compromise expression derived from many\\r\\noccasions. and there is hardly any limit to the vagueness of which\\r\\nimages are capable. in such cases, the meaning of the image, if defined\\r\\nby relation to the prototype, is vague: there is not one definite\\r\\nprototype, but a number, none of which is copied exactly.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. semon, mnemische empfindungen, chap. xvi, especially\\r\\n     pp. 301-308.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, another way of approaching the meaning of images,\\r\\nnamely through their causal efficacy. what is called an image \"of\"\\r\\nsome definite object, say st. paul\\'s, has some of the effects which the\\r\\nobject would have. this applies especially to the effects that depend\\r\\nupon association. the emotional effects, also, are often similar:\\r\\nimages may stimulate desire almost as strongly as do the objects they\\r\\nrepresent. and conversely desire may cause images*: a hungry man will\\r\\nhave images of food, and so on. in all these ways the causal laws\\r\\nconcerning images are connected with the causal laws concerning the\\r\\nobjects which the images \"mean.\" an image may thus come to fulfil the\\r\\nfunction of a general idea. the vague image of a dog, which we spoke of\\r\\na moment ago, will have effects which are only connected with dogs in\\r\\ngeneral, not the more special effects which would be produced by some\\r\\ndogs but not by others. berkeley and hume, in their attack on general\\r\\nideas, do not allow for the vagueness of images: they assume that every\\r\\nimage has the definiteness that a physical object would have this is not\\r\\nthe case, and a vague image may well have a meaning which is general.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * this phrase is in need of interpretation, as appears from\\r\\n     the analysis of desire. but the reader can easily supply the\\r\\n     interpretation for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to define the \"meaning\" of an image, we have to take account\\r\\nboth of its resemblance to one or more prototypes, and of its causal\\r\\nefficacy. if there were such a thing as a pure imagination-image,\\r\\nwithout any prototype whatever, it would be destitute of meaning. but\\r\\naccording to hume\\'s principle, the simple elements in an image,\\r\\nat least, are derived from prototypes-except possibly in very rare\\r\\nexceptional cases. often, in such instances as our image of a friend\\'s\\r\\nface or of a nondescript dog, an image is not derived from one\\r\\nprototype, but from many; when this happens, the image is vague, and\\r\\nblurs the features in which the various prototypes differ. to arrive\\r\\nat the meaning of the image in such a case, we observe that there are\\r\\ncertain respects, notably associations, in which the effects of images\\r\\nresemble those of their prototypes. if we find, in a given case, that\\r\\nour vague image, say, of a nondescript dog, has those associative\\r\\neffects which all dogs would have, but not those belonging to any\\r\\nspecial dog or kind of dog, we may say that our image means \"dog\" in\\r\\ngeneral. if it has all the associations appropriate to spaniels but\\r\\nno others, we shall say it means \"spaniel\"; while if it has all the\\r\\nassociations appropriate to one particular dog, it will mean that dog,\\r\\nhowever vague it may be as a picture. the meaning of an image, according\\r\\nto this analysis, is constituted by a combination of likeness and\\r\\nassociations. it is not a sharp or definite conception, and in many\\r\\ncases it will be impossible to decide with any certainty what an image\\r\\nmeans. i think this lies in the nature of things, and not in defective\\r\\nanalysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may give somewhat more precision to the above account of the meaning\\r\\nof images, and extend it to meaning in general. we find sometimes that,\\r\\nin mnemic causation, an image or word, as stimulus, has the same effect\\r\\n(or very nearly the same effect) as would belong to some object, say,\\r\\na certain dog. in that case we say that the image or word means that\\r\\nobject. in other cases the mnemic effects are not all those of one\\r\\nobject, but only those shared by objects of a certain kind, e.g. by all\\r\\ndogs. in this case the meaning of the image or word is general: it means\\r\\nthe whole kind. generality and particularity are a matter of degree. if\\r\\ntwo particulars differ sufficiently little, their mnemic effects will be\\r\\nthe same; therefore no image or word can mean the one as opposed to the\\r\\nother; this sets a bound to the particularity of meaning. on the other\\r\\nhand, the mnemic effects of a number of sufficiently dissimilar objects\\r\\nwill have nothing discoverable in common; hence a word which aims at\\r\\ncomplete generality, such as \"entity\" for example, will have to be\\r\\ndevoid of mnemic effects, and therefore of meaning. in practice, this is\\r\\nnot the case: such words have verbal associations, the learning of which\\r\\nconstitutes the study of metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe meaning of a word, unlike that of an image, is wholly constituted\\r\\nby mnemic causal laws, and not in any degree by likeness (except in\\r\\nexceptional cases). the word \"dog\" bears no resemblance to a dog, but\\r\\nits effects, like those of an image of a dog, resemble the effects of an\\r\\nactual dog in certain respects. it is much easier to say definitely\\r\\nwhat a word means than what an image means, since words, however they\\r\\noriginated, have been framed in later times for the purpose of having\\r\\nmeaning, and men have been engaged for ages in giving increased\\r\\nprecision to the meanings of words. but although it is easier to\\r\\nsay what a word means than what an image means, the relation which\\r\\nconstitutes meaning is much the same in both cases. a word, like an\\r\\nimage, has the same associations as its meaning has. in addition to\\r\\nother associations, it is associated with images of its meaning, so that\\r\\nthe word tends to call up the image and the image tends to call up the\\r\\nword., but this association is not essential to the intelligent use of\\r\\nwords. if a word has the right associations with other objects, we shall\\r\\nbe able to use it correctly, and understand its use by others, even if\\r\\nit evokes no image. the theoretical understanding of words involves only\\r\\nthe power of associating them correctly with other words; the practical\\r\\nunderstanding involves associations with other bodily movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe use of words is, of course, primarily social, for the purpose of\\r\\nsuggesting to others ideas which we entertain or at least wish them to\\r\\nentertain. but the aspect of words that specially concerns us is their\\r\\npower of promoting our own thought. almost all higher intellectual\\r\\nactivity is a matter of words, to the nearly total exclusion of\\r\\neverything else. the advantages of words for purposes of thought are so\\r\\ngreat that i should never end if i were to enumerate them. but a few of\\r\\nthem deserve to be mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the first place, there is no difficulty in producing a word, whereas\\r\\nan image cannot always be brought into existence at will, and when it\\r\\ncomes it often contains much irrelevant detail. in the second place,\\r\\nmuch of our thinking is concerned with abstract matters which do not\\r\\nreadily lend themselves to imagery, and are apt to be falsely conceived\\r\\nif we insist upon finding images that may be supposed to represent them.\\r\\nthe word is always concrete and sensible, however abstract its\\r\\nmeaning may be, and thus by the help of words we are able to dwell on\\r\\nabstractions in a way which would otherwise be impossible. in the third\\r\\nplace, two instances of the same word are so similar that neither has\\r\\nassociations not capable of being shared by the other. two instances of\\r\\nthe word \"dog\" are much more alike than (say) a pug and a great dane;\\r\\nhence the word \"dog\" makes it much easier to think about dogs in\\r\\ngeneral. when a number of objects have a common property which is\\r\\nimportant but not obvious, the invention of a name for the common\\r\\nproperty helps us to remember it and to think of the whole set of\\r\\nobjects that possess it. but it is unnecessary to prolong the catalogue\\r\\nof the uses of language in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nat the same time, it is possible to conduct rudimentary thought by\\r\\nmeans of images, and it is important, sometimes, to check purely verbal\\r\\nthought by reference to what it means. in philosophy especially the\\r\\ntyranny of traditional words is dangerous, and we have to be on our\\r\\nguard against assuming that grammar is the key to metaphysics, or that\\r\\nthe structure of a sentence corresponds at all accurately with the\\r\\nstructure of the fact that it asserts. sayce maintained that all\\r\\neuropean philosophy since aristotle has been dominated by the fact that\\r\\nthe philosophers spoke indo-european languages, and therefore supposed\\r\\nthe world, like the sentences they were used to, necessarily divisible\\r\\ninto subjects and predicates. when we come to the consideration of truth\\r\\nand falsehood, we shall see how necessary it is to avoid assuming too\\r\\nclose a parallelism between facts and the sentences which assert them.\\r\\nagainst such errors, the only safeguard is to be able, once in a way, to\\r\\ndiscard words for a moment and contemplate facts more directly through\\r\\nimages. most serious advances in philosophic thought result from some\\r\\nsuch comparatively direct contemplation of facts. but the outcome has\\r\\nto be expressed in words if it is to be communicable. those who have\\r\\na relatively direct vision of facts are often incapable of translating\\r\\ntheir vision into words, while those who possess the words have\\r\\nusually lost the vision. it is partly for this reason that the highest\\r\\nphilosophical capacity is so rare: it requires a combination of vision\\r\\nwith abstract words which is hard to achieve, and too quickly lost in\\r\\nthe few who have for a moment achieved it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture xi. general ideas and thought\\r\\n\\r\\nit is said to be one of the merits of the human mind that it is capable\\r\\nof framing abstract ideas, and of conducting nonsensational thought.\\r\\nin this it is supposed to differ from the mind of animals. from plato\\r\\nonward the \"idea\" has played a great part in the systems of idealizing\\r\\nphilosophers. the \"idea\" has been, in their hands, always something\\r\\nnoble and abstract, the apprehension and use of which by man confers\\r\\nupon him a quite special dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe thing we have to consider to-day is this: seeing that there\\r\\ncertainly are words of which the meaning is abstract, and seeing that we\\r\\ncan use these words intelligently, what must be assumed or inferred, or\\r\\nwhat can be discovered by observation, in the way of mental content to\\r\\naccount for the intelligent use of abstract words?\\r\\n\\r\\ntaken as a problem in logic, the answer is, of course, that absolutely\\r\\nnothing in the way of abstract mental content is inferable from the\\r\\nmere fact that we can use intelligently words of which the meaning\\r\\nis abstract. it is clear that a sufficiently ingenious person could\\r\\nmanufacture a machine moved by olfactory stimuli which, whenever a dog\\r\\nappeared in its neighbourhood, would say, \"there is a dog,\" and when\\r\\na cat appeared would throw stones at it. the act of saying \"there is a\\r\\ndog,\" and the act of throwing stones, would in such a case be equally\\r\\nmechanical. correct speech does not of itself afford any better evidence\\r\\nof mental content than the performance of any other set of biologically\\r\\nuseful movements, such as those of flight or combat. all that is\\r\\ninferable from language is that two instances of a universal, even when\\r\\nthey differ very greatly, may cause the utterance of two instances\\r\\nof the same word which only differ very slightly. as we saw in the\\r\\npreceding lecture, the word \"dog\" is useful, partly, because two\\r\\ninstances of this word are much more similar than (say) a pug and a\\r\\ngreat dane. the use of words is thus a method of substituting for two\\r\\nparticulars which differ widely, in spite of being instances of the same\\r\\nuniversal, two other particulars which differ very little, and which\\r\\nare also instances of a universal, namely the name of the previous\\r\\nuniversal. thus, so far as logic is concerned, we are entirely free to\\r\\nadopt any theory as to general ideas which empirical observation may\\r\\nrecommend.\\r\\n\\r\\nberkeley and hume made a vigorous onslaught on \"abstract ideas.\" they\\r\\nmeant by an idea approximately what we should call an image. locke\\r\\nhaving maintained that he could form an idea of triangle in general,\\r\\nwithout deciding what sort of triangle it was to be, berkeley contended\\r\\nthat this was impossible. he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"whether others, have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas,\\r\\nthey best can tell: for myself, i dare be confident i have it not. i\\r\\nfind, indeed, i have indeed a faculty of imagining, or representing to\\r\\nmyself, the ideas of those particular things i have perceived, and of\\r\\nvariously compounding and dividing them. i can imagine a man with two\\r\\nheads, or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse. i\\r\\ncan consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or\\r\\nseparated from the rest of the body. but, then, whatever hand or eye\\r\\ni imagine, it must have some particular shape and colour. likewise the\\r\\nidea of a man that i frame to myself must be either of a white, or a\\r\\nblack, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or\\r\\na middle-sized man. i cannot by any effort of thought conceive the\\r\\nabstract idea above described. and it is equally impossible for me to\\r\\nform the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and\\r\\nwhich is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the\\r\\nlike may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever. to be\\r\\nplain, i own myself able to abstract in one sense, as when i consider\\r\\nsome particular parts of qualities separated from others, with which,\\r\\nthough they are united in some object, yet it is possible they may\\r\\nreally exist without them. but i deny that i can abstract from one\\r\\nanother, or conceive separately, those qualities which it is impossible\\r\\nshould exist so separated; or that i can frame a general notion, by\\r\\nabstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid--which last are\\r\\nthe two proper acceptations of abstraction. and there is ground to think\\r\\nmost men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case. the generality of\\r\\nmen which are simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions.\\r\\nit is said they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and\\r\\nstudy; we may therefore reasonably conclude that, if such there be, they\\r\\nare confined only to the learned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i proceed to examine what can be alleged in defence of the doctrine of\\r\\nabstraction, and try if i can discover what it is that inclines the men\\r\\nof speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that\\r\\nseems to be. there has been a late excellent and deservedly esteemed\\r\\nphilosopher who, no doubt, has given it very much countenance, by\\r\\nseeming to think the having abstract general ideas is what puts the\\r\\nwidest difference in point of understanding betwixt man and beast.\\r\\n\\'the having of general ideas,\\' saith he, \\'is that which puts a perfect\\r\\ndistinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the\\r\\nfaculties of brutes do by no means attain unto. for, it is evident\\r\\nwe observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for\\r\\nuniversal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they have not\\r\\nthe faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since they have\\r\\nno use of words or any other general signs.\\' and a little after:\\r\\n\\'therefore, i think, we may suppose that it is in this that the species\\r\\nof brutes are discriminated from men, and it is that proper difference\\r\\nwherein they are wholly separated, and which at last widens to so wide a\\r\\ndistance. for, if they have any ideas at all, and are not bare machines\\r\\n(as some would have them), we cannot deny them to have some reason. it\\r\\nseems as evident to me that they do, some of them, in certain instances\\r\\nreason as that they have sense; but it is only in particular ideas, just\\r\\nas they receive them from their senses. they are the best of them tied\\r\\nup within those narrow bounds, and have not (as i think) the faculty\\r\\nto enlarge them by any kind of abstraction.* (\"essay on human\\r\\nunderstanding,\" bk. ii, chap. xi, paragraphs 10 and 11.) i readily agree\\r\\nwith this learned author, that the faculties of brutes can by no means\\r\\nattain to abstraction. but, then, if this be made the distinguishing\\r\\nproperty of that sort of animals, i fear a great many of those that\\r\\npass for men must be reckoned into their number. the reason that is here\\r\\nassigned why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract general\\r\\nideas is, that we observe in them no use of words or any other general\\r\\nsigns; which is built on this supposition-that the making use of words\\r\\nimplies the having general ideas. from which it follows that men who use\\r\\nlanguage are able to abstract or generalize their ideas. that this is\\r\\nthe sense and arguing of the author will further appear by his answering\\r\\nthe question he in another place puts: \\'since all things that exist are\\r\\nonly particulars, how come we by general terms?\\' his answer is: \\'words\\r\\nbecome general by being made the signs of general ideas.\\' (\"essay on\\r\\nhuman understanding,\" bk. iii, chap. iii, paragraph 6.) but it seems\\r\\nthat a word becomes general by being made the sign, not of an abstract\\r\\ngeneral idea, but of several particular ideas, any one of which it\\r\\nindifferently suggests to the mind. for example, when it is said \\'the\\r\\nchange of motion is proportional to the impressed force,\\' or that\\r\\n\\'whatever has extension is divisible,\\' these propositions are to be\\r\\nunderstood of motion and extension in general; and nevertheless it will\\r\\nnot follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without\\r\\na body moved, or any determinate direction and velocity, or that i must\\r\\nconceive an abstract general idea of extension, which is neither line,\\r\\nsurface, nor solid, neither great nor small, black, white, nor red,\\r\\nnor of any other determinate colour. it is only implied that\\r\\nwhatever particular motion i consider, whether it be swift or slow,\\r\\nperpendicular, horizontal, or oblique, or in whatever object, the axiom\\r\\nconcerning it holds equally true. as does the other of every particular\\r\\nextension, it matters not whether line, surface, or solid, whether of\\r\\nthis or that magnitude or figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"by observing how ideas become general, we may the better judge how\\r\\nwords are made so. and here it is to be noted that i do not deny\\r\\nabsolutely there are general ideas, but only that there are any abstract\\r\\ngeneral ideas; for, in the passages we have quoted wherein there is\\r\\nmention of general ideas, it is always supposed that they are formed by\\r\\nabstraction, after the manner set forth in sections 8 and 9. now, if\\r\\nwe will annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we can\\r\\nconceive, i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which, considered\\r\\nin itself, is particular, becomes general by being made to represent\\r\\nor stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort. to make this\\r\\nplain by an example, suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method\\r\\nof cutting a line in two equal parts. he draws, for instance, a black\\r\\nline of an inch in length: this, which in itself is a particular line,\\r\\nis nevertheless with regard to its signification general, since, as it\\r\\nis there used, it represents all particular lines whatsoever; so that\\r\\nwhat is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines, or, in other\\r\\nwords, of a line in general. and, as that particular line becomes\\r\\ngeneral by being made a sign, so the name \\'line,\\' which taken absolutely\\r\\nis particular, by being a sign is made general. and as the former owes\\r\\nits generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line,\\r\\nbut of all particular right lines that may possibly exist, so the latter\\r\\nmust be thought to derive its generality from the same cause, namely,\\r\\nthe various particular lines which it indifferently denotes.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n     * introduction to \"a treatise concerning the principles of\\r\\n     human knowledge,\" paragraphs 10, 11, and 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nberkeley\\'s view in the above passage, which is essentially the same as\\r\\nhume\\'s, does not wholly agree with modern psychology, although it comes\\r\\nnearer to agreement than does the view of those who believe that there\\r\\nare in the mind single contents which can be called abstract ideas. the\\r\\nway in which berkeley\\'s view is inadequate is chiefly in the fact that\\r\\nimages are as a rule not of one definite prototype, but of a number of\\r\\nrelated similar prototypes. on this subject semon has written well.\\r\\nin \"die mneme,\" pp. 217 ff., discussing the effect of repeated similar\\r\\nstimuli in producing and modifying our images, he says: \"we choose a\\r\\ncase of mnemic excitement whose existence we can perceive for ourselves\\r\\nby introspection, and seek to ekphore the bodily picture of our nearest\\r\\nrelation in his absence, and have thus a pure mnemic excitement before\\r\\nus. at first it may seem to us that a determinate quite concrete picture\\r\\nbecomes manifest in us, but just when we are concerned with a person\\r\\nwith whom we are in constant contact, we shall find that the ekphored\\r\\npicture has something so to speak generalized. it is something like\\r\\nthose american photographs which seek to display what is general about a\\r\\ntype by combining a great number of photographs of different heads over\\r\\neach other on one plate. in our opinion, the generalizations happen by\\r\\nthe homophonic working of different pictures of the same face which we\\r\\nhave come across in the most different conditions and situations, once\\r\\npale, once reddened, once cheerful, once earnest, once in this\\r\\nlight, and once in that. as soon as we do not let the whole series\\r\\nof repetitions resound in us uniformly, but give our attention to one\\r\\nparticular moment out of the many... this particular mnemic stimulus at\\r\\nonce overbalances its simultaneously roused predecessors and successors,\\r\\nand we perceive the face in question with concrete definiteness in that\\r\\nparticular situation.\" a little later he says: \"the result is--at least\\r\\nin man, but probably also in the higher animals--the development of a\\r\\nsort of physiological abstraction. mnemic homophony gives us, without\\r\\nthe addition of other processes of thought, a picture of our friend\\r\\nx which is in a certain sense abstract, not the concrete in any one\\r\\nsituation, but x cut loose from any particular point of time. if the\\r\\ncircle of ekphored engrams is drawn even more widely, abstract pictures\\r\\nof a higher order appear: for instance, a white man or a negro. in my\\r\\nopinion, the first form of abstract concepts in general is based upon\\r\\nsuch abstract pictures. the physiological abstraction which takes\\r\\nplace in the above described manner is a predecessor of purely logical\\r\\nabstraction. it is by no means a monopoly of the human race, but shows\\r\\nitself in various ways also among the more highly organized animals.\"\\r\\nthe same subject is treated in more detail in chapter xvi of \"die\\r\\nmnemischen empfindungen,\" but what is said there adds nothing vital to\\r\\nwhat is contained in the above quotations.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is necessary, however, to distinguish between the vague and the\\r\\ngeneral. so long as we are content with semon\\'s composite image, we may\\r\\nget no farther than the vague. the question whether this image takes us\\r\\nto the general or not depends, i think, upon the question whether, in\\r\\naddition to the generalized image, we have also particular images\\r\\nof some of the instances out of which it is compounded. suppose, for\\r\\nexample, that on a number of occasions you had seen one negro, and\\r\\nthat you did not know whether this one was the same or different on\\r\\nthe different occasions. suppose that in the end you had an abstract\\r\\nmemory-image of the different appearances presented by the negro on\\r\\ndifferent occasions, but no memory-image of any one of the single\\r\\nappearances. in that case your image would be vague. if, on the other\\r\\nhand, you have, in addition to the generalized image, particular images\\r\\nof the several appearances, sufficiently clear to be recognized as\\r\\ndifferent, and as instances of the generalized picture, you will then\\r\\nnot feel the generalized picture to be adequate to any one particular\\r\\nappearance, and you will be able to make it function as a general\\r\\nidea rather than a vague idea. if this view is correct, no new general\\r\\ncontent needs to be added to the generalized image. what needs to be\\r\\nadded is particular images compared and contrasted with the generalized\\r\\nimage. so far as i can judge by introspection, this does occur in\\r\\npractice. take for example semon\\'s instance of a friend\\'s face. unless\\r\\nwe make some special effort of recollection, the face is likely to come\\r\\nbefore us with an average expression, very blurred and vague, but we can\\r\\nat will recall how our friend looked on some special occasion when he\\r\\nwas pleased or angry or unhappy, and this enables us to realize the\\r\\ngeneralized character of the vague image.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, another way of distinguishing between the vague, the\\r\\nparticular and the general, and this is not by their content, but by\\r\\nthe reaction which they produce. a word, for example, may be said to be\\r\\nvague when it is applicable to a number of different individuals, but to\\r\\neach as individuals; the name smith, for example, is vague: it is always\\r\\nmeant to apply to one man, but there are many men to each of whom it\\r\\napplies.* the word \"man,\" on the other hand, is general. we say, \"this\\r\\nis smith,\" but we do not say \"this is man,\" but \"this is a man.\" thus\\r\\nwe may say that a word embodies a vague idea when its effects are\\r\\nappropriate to an individual, but are the same for various similar\\r\\nindividuals, while a word embodies a general idea when its effects are\\r\\ndifferent from those appropriate to individuals. in what this difference\\r\\nconsists it is, however, not easy to say. i am inclined to think that it\\r\\nconsists merely in the knowledge that no one individual is represented,\\r\\nso that what distinguishes a general idea from a vague idea is merely\\r\\nthe presence of a certain accompanying belief. if this view is correct,\\r\\na general idea differs from a vague one in a way analogous to that in\\r\\nwhich a memory-image differs from an imagination-image. there also\\r\\nwe found that the difference consists merely of the fact that a\\r\\nmemory-image is accompanied by a belief, in this case as to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"smith\" would only be a quite satisfactory representation\\r\\n     of vague words if we failed to discriminate between\\r\\n     different people called smith.\\r\\n\\r\\nit should also be said that our images even of quite particular\\r\\noccurrences have always a greater or a less degree of vagueness. that is\\r\\nto say, the occurrence might have varied within certain limits without\\r\\ncausing our image to vary recognizably. to arrive at the general it\\r\\nis necessary that we should be able to contrast it with a number of\\r\\nrelatively precise images or words for particular occurrences; so long\\r\\nas all our images and words are vague, we cannot arrive at the contrast\\r\\nby which the general is defined. this is the justification for the\\r\\nview which i quoted on p. 184 from ribot (op. cit., p. 32), viz. that\\r\\nintelligence progresses from the indefinite to the definite, and that\\r\\nthe vague appears earlier than either the particular or the general.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think the view which i have been advocating, to the effect that a\\r\\ngeneral idea is distinguished from a vague one by the presence of a\\r\\njudgment, is also that intended by ribot when he says (op. cit., p. 92):\\r\\n\"the generic image is never, the concept is always, a judgment. we know\\r\\nthat for logicians (formerly at any rate) the concept is the simple\\r\\nand primitive element; next comes the judgment, uniting two or several\\r\\nconcepts; then ratiocination, combining two or several judgments. for\\r\\nthe psychologists, on the contrary, affirmation is the fundamental\\r\\nact; the concept is the result of judgment (explicit or implicit), of\\r\\nsimilarities with exclusion of differences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\na great deal of work professing to be experimental has been done in\\r\\nrecent years on the psychology of thought. a good summary of such\\r\\nwork up to the year agog is contained in titchener\\'s \"lectures on the\\r\\nexperimental psychology of the thought processes\" (1909). three articles\\r\\nin the \"archiv fur die gesammte psychologie\" by watt,* messer** and\\r\\nbuhler*** contain a great deal of the material amassed by the methods\\r\\nwhich titchener calls experimental.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * henry j. watt, \"experimentelle beitrage zu einer theorie\\r\\n     des denkens,\" vol. iv (1905) pp. 289-436.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** august messer, \"experimentell-psychologische untersuchu\\r\\n     gen uber das denken,\" vol. iii (1906), pp. 1-224.\\r\\n\\r\\n     *** karl buhler, \"uber gedanken,\" vol. ix (1907), pp. 297-365.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor my part i am unable to attach as much importance to this work as\\r\\nmany psychologists do. the method employed appears to me hardly to\\r\\nfulfil the conditions of scientific experiment. broadly speaking, what\\r\\nis done is, that a set of questions are asked of various people, their\\r\\nanswers are recorded, and likewise their own accounts, based upon\\r\\nintrospection, of the processes of thought which led them to give\\r\\nthose answers. much too much reliance seems to me to be placed upon the\\r\\ncorrectness of their introspection. on introspection as a method i have\\r\\nspoken earlier (lecture vi). i am not prepared, like professor watson,\\r\\nto reject it wholly, but i do consider that it is exceedingly fallible\\r\\nand quite peculiarly liable to falsification in accordance with\\r\\npreconceived theory. it is like depending upon the report of a\\r\\nshortsighted person as to whom he sees coming along the road at a moment\\r\\nwhen he is firmly convinced that jones is sure to come. if everybody\\r\\nwere shortsighted and obsessed with beliefs as to what was going to be\\r\\nvisible, we might have to make the best of such testimony, but we should\\r\\nneed to correct its errors by taking care to collect the simultaneous\\r\\nevidence of people with the most divergent expectations. there is no\\r\\nevidence that this was done in the experiments in question, nor indeed\\r\\nthat the influence of theory in falsifying the introspection was at all\\r\\nadequately recognized. i feel convinced that if professor watson had\\r\\nbeen one of the subjects of the questionnaires, he would have given\\r\\nanswers totally different from those recorded in the articles in\\r\\nquestion. titchener quotes an opinion of wundt on these investigations,\\r\\nwhich appears to me thoroughly justified. \"these experiments,\" he says,\\r\\n\"are not experiments at all in the sense of a scientific methodology;\\r\\nthey are counterfeit experiments, that seem methodical simply because\\r\\nthey are ordinarily performed in a psychological laboratory, and involve\\r\\nthe co-operation of two persons, who purport to be experimenter and\\r\\nobserver. in reality, they are as unmethodical as possible; they possess\\r\\nnone of the special features by which we distinguish the introspections\\r\\nof experimental psychology from the casual introspections of everyday\\r\\nlife.\"* titchener, of course, dissents from this opinion, but i cannot\\r\\nsee that his reasons for dissent are adequate. my doubts are only\\r\\nincreased by the fact that buhler at any rate used trained psychologists\\r\\nas his subjects. a trained psychologist is, of course, supposed to have\\r\\nacquired the habit of observation, but he is at least equally likely to\\r\\nhave acquired a habit of seeing what his theories require. we may take\\r\\nbuhler\\'s \"uber gedanken\" to illustrate the kind of results arrived at\\r\\nby such methods. buhler says (p. 303): \"we ask ourselves the general\\r\\nquestion: \\'what do we experience when we think?\\' then we do not at all\\r\\nattempt a preliminary determination of the concept \\'thought,\\' but choose\\r\\nfor analysis only such processes as everyone would describe as\\r\\nprocesses of thought.\" the most important thing in thinking, he says, is\\r\\n\"awareness that...\" (bewusstheit dass), which he calls a thought. it\\r\\nis, he says, thoughts in this sense that are essential to thinking.\\r\\nthinking, he maintains, does not need language or sensuous\\r\\npresentations. \"i assert rather that in principle every object can be\\r\\nthought (meant) distinctly, without any help from sensuous presentation\\r\\n(anschauungshilfen). every individual shade of blue colour on the\\r\\npicture that hangs in my room i can think with complete distinctness\\r\\nunsensuously (unanschaulich), provided it is possible that the object\\r\\nshould be given to me in another manner than by the help of sensations.\\r\\nhow that is possible we shall see later.\" what he calls a thought\\r\\n(gedanke) cannot be reduced, according to him, to other psychic\\r\\noccurrences. he maintains that thoughts consist for the most part of\\r\\nknown rules (p. 342). it is clearly essential to the interest of this\\r\\ntheory that the thought or rule alluded to by buhler should not need to\\r\\nbe expressed in words, for if it is expressed in words it is immediately\\r\\ncapable of being dealt with on the lines with which the behaviourists\\r\\nhave familiarized us. it is clear also that the supposed absence of\\r\\nwords rests solely upon the introspective testimony of the persons\\r\\nexperimented upon. i cannot think that there is sufficient certainty\\r\\nof their reliability in this negative observation to make us accept a\\r\\ndifficult and revolutionary view of thought, merely because they have\\r\\nfailed to observe the presence of words or their equivalent in their\\r\\nthinking. i think it far more likely, especially in view of the fact\\r\\nthat the persons concerned were highly educated, that we are concerned\\r\\nwith telescoped processes, in which habit has caused a great many\\r\\nintermediate terms to be elided or to be passed over so quickly as to\\r\\nescape observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * titchener, op. cit., p. 79.\\r\\n\\r\\ni am inclined to think that similar remarks apply to the general idea of\\r\\n\"imageless thinking,\" concerning which there has been much controversy.\\r\\nthe advocates of imageless thinking are not contending merely that there\\r\\ncan be thinking which is purely verbal; they are contending that there\\r\\ncan be thinking which proceeds neither in words nor in images. my own\\r\\nfeeling is that they have rashly assumed the presence of thinking in\\r\\ncases where habit has rendered thinking unnecessary. when thorndike\\r\\nexperimented with animals in cages, he found that the associations\\r\\nestablished were between a sensory stimulus and a bodily movement (not\\r\\nthe idea of it), without the need of supposing any non-physiological\\r\\nintermediary (op. cit., p. 100 ff.). the same thing, it seems to me,\\r\\napplies to ourselves. a certain sensory situation produces in us a\\r\\ncertain bodily movement. sometimes this movement consists in uttering\\r\\nwords. prejudice leads us to suppose that between the sensory\\r\\nstimulus and the utterance of the words a process of thought must have\\r\\nintervened, but there seems no good reason for such a supposition. any\\r\\nhabitual action, such as eating or dressing, may be performed on the\\r\\nappropriate occasion, without any need of thought, and the same seems\\r\\nto be true of a painfully large proportion of our talk. what applies to\\r\\nuttered speech applies of course equally to the internal speech which is\\r\\nnot uttered. i remain, therefore, entirely unconvinced that there is\\r\\nany such phenomenon as thinking which consists neither of images nor of\\r\\nwords, or that \"ideas\" have to be added to sensations and images as part\\r\\nof the material out of which mental phenomena are built.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question of the nature of our consciousness of the universal is\\r\\nmuch affected by our view as to the general nature of the relation of\\r\\nconsciousness to its object. if we adopt the view of brentano, according\\r\\nto which all mental content has essential reference to an object, it\\r\\nis then natural to suppose that there is some peculiar kind of mental\\r\\ncontent of which the object is a universal, as oppose to a particular.\\r\\naccording to this view, a particular cat can be perceived or imagined,\\r\\nwhile the universal \"cat\" is conceived. but this whole manner of viewing\\r\\nour dealings with universals has to be abandoned when the relation of\\r\\na mental occurrence to its \"object\" is regarded as merely indirect and\\r\\ncausal, which is the view that we have adopted. the mental content is,\\r\\nof course, always particular, and the question as to what it \"means\"\\r\\n(in case it means anything) is one which cannot be settled by merely\\r\\nexamining the intrinsic character of the mental content, but only by\\r\\nknowing its causal connections in the case of the person concerned. to\\r\\nsay that a certain thought \"means\" a universal as opposed to either a\\r\\nvague or a particular, is to say something exceedingly complex. a horse\\r\\nwill behave in a certain manner whenever he smells a bear, even if\\r\\nthe smell is derived from a bearskin. that is to say, any environment\\r\\ncontaining an instance of the universal \"smell of a bear\" produces\\r\\nclosely similar behaviour in the horse, but we do not say that the horse\\r\\nis conscious of this universal. there is equally little reason to\\r\\nregard a man as conscious of the same universal, because under the same\\r\\ncircumstances he can react by saying, \"i smell a bear.\" this reaction,\\r\\nlike that of the horse, is merely closely similar on different occasions\\r\\nwhere the environment affords instances of the same universal. words\\r\\nof which the logical meaning is universal can therefore be employed\\r\\ncorrectly, without anything that could be called consciousness of\\r\\nuniversals. such consciousness in the only sense in which it can be\\r\\nsaid to exist is a matter of reflective judgment consisting in the\\r\\nobservation of similarities and differences. a universal never appears\\r\\nbefore the mind as a single object in the sort of way in which something\\r\\nperceived appears. i think a logical argument could be produced to show\\r\\nthat universals are part of the structure of the world, but they are\\r\\nan inferred part, not a part of our data. what exists in us consists of\\r\\nvarious factors, some open to external observation, others only visible\\r\\nto introspection. the factors open to external observation are primarily\\r\\nhabits, having the peculiarity that very similar reactions are produced\\r\\nby stimuli which are in many respects very different from each other. of\\r\\nthis the reaction of the horse to the smell of the bear is an instance,\\r\\nand so is the reaction of the man who says \"bear\" under the same\\r\\ncircumstances. the verbal reaction is, of course, the most important\\r\\nfrom the point of view of what may be called knowledge of universals. a\\r\\nman who can always use the word \"dog\" when he sees a dog may be said,\\r\\nin a certain sense, to know the meaning of the word \"dog,\" and in that\\r\\nsense to have knowledge of the universal \"dog.\" but there is, of course,\\r\\na further stage reached by the logician in which he not merely reacts\\r\\nwith the word \"dog,\" but sets to work to discover what it is in the\\r\\nenvironment that causes in him this almost identical reaction on\\r\\ndifferent occasions. this further stage consists in knowledge of\\r\\nsimilarities and differences: similarities which are necessary to the\\r\\napplicability of the word \"dog,\" and differences which are compatible\\r\\nwith it. our knowledge of these similarities and differences is never\\r\\nexhaustive, and therefore our knowledge of the meaning of a universal is\\r\\nnever complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition to external observable habits (including the habit of\\r\\nwords), there is also the generic image produced by the superposition,\\r\\nor, in semon\\'s phrase, homophony, of a number of similar perceptions.\\r\\nthis image is vague so long as the multiplicity of its prototypes is not\\r\\nrecognized, but becomes universal when it exists alongside of the more\\r\\nspecific images of its instances, and is knowingly contrasted with them.\\r\\nin this case we find again, as we found when we were discussing words\\r\\nin general in the preceding lecture, that images are not logically\\r\\nnecessary in order to account for observable behaviour, i.e. in this\\r\\ncase intelligent speech. intelligent speech could exist as a motor\\r\\nhabit, without any accompaniment of images, and this conclusion applies\\r\\nto words of which the meaning is universal, just as much as to words of\\r\\nwhich the meaning is relatively particular. if this conclusion is valid,\\r\\nit follows that behaviourist psychology, which eschews introspective\\r\\ndata, is capable of being an independent science, and of accounting\\r\\nfor all that part of the behaviour of other people which is commonly\\r\\nregarded as evidence that they think. it must be admitted that this\\r\\nconclusion considerably weakens the reliance which can be placed upon\\r\\nintrospective data. they must be accepted simply on account of the\\r\\nfact that we seem to perceive them, not on account of their supposed\\r\\nnecessity for explaining the data of external observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis, at any rate, is the conclusion to which we are forced, so long\\r\\nas, with the behaviourists, we accept common-sense views of the physical\\r\\nworld. but if, as i have urged, the physical world itself, as known,\\r\\nis infected through and through with subjectivity, if, as the theory\\r\\nof relativity suggests, the physical universe contains the diversity of\\r\\npoints of view which we have been accustomed to regard as distinctively\\r\\npsychological, then we are brought back by this different road to the\\r\\nnecessity for trusting observations which are in an important sense\\r\\nprivate. and it is the privacy of introspective data which causes much\\r\\nof the behaviourists\\' objection to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is an example of the difficulty of constructing an adequate\\r\\nphilosophy of any one science without taking account of other sciences.\\r\\nthe behaviourist philosophy of psychology, though in many respects\\r\\nadmirable from the point of view of method, appears to me to fail in\\r\\nthe last analysis because it is based upon an inadequate philosophy of\\r\\nphysics. in spite, therefore, of the fact that the evidence for images,\\r\\nwhether generic or particular, is merely introspective, i cannot\\r\\nadmit that images should be rejected, or that we should minimize their\\r\\nfunction in our knowledge of what is remote in time or space.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture xii. belief\\r\\n\\r\\nbelief, which is our subject to-day, is the central problem in the\\r\\nanalysis of mind. believing seems the most \"mental\" thing we do,\\r\\nthe thing most remote from what is done by mere matter. the whole\\r\\nintellectual life consists of beliefs, and of the passage from one\\r\\nbelief to another by what is called \"reasoning.\" beliefs give knowledge\\r\\nand error; they are the vehicles of truth and falsehood. psychology,\\r\\ntheory of knowledge and metaphysics revolve about belief, and on the\\r\\nview we take of belief our philosophical outlook largely depends.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore embarking upon the detailed analysis of belief, we shall do well\\r\\nto note certain requisites which any theory must fulfil.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) just as words are characterized by meaning, so beliefs are\\r\\ncharacterized by truth or falsehood. and just as meaning consists in\\r\\nrelation to the object meant, so truth and falsehood consist in\\r\\nrelation to something that lies outside the belief. you may believe that\\r\\nsuch-and-such a horse will win the derby. the time comes, and your horse\\r\\nwins or does not win; according to the outcome, your belief was true or\\r\\nfalse. you may believe that six times nine is fifty-six; in this case\\r\\nalso there is a fact which makes your belief false. you may believe that\\r\\namerica was discovered in 1492, or that it was discovered in 1066. in\\r\\nthe one case your belief is true, in the other false; in either case\\r\\nits truth or falsehood depends upon the actions of columbus, not upon\\r\\nanything present or under your control. what makes a belief true or\\r\\nfalse i call a \"fact.\" the particular fact that makes a given belief\\r\\ntrue or false i call its \"objective,\"* and the relation of the belief to\\r\\nits objective i call the \"reference\" or the \"objective reference\" of the\\r\\nbelief. thus, if i believe that columbus crossed the atlantic in 1492,\\r\\nthe \"objective\" of my belief is columbus\\'s actual voyage, and the\\r\\n\"reference\" of my belief is the relation between my belief and the\\r\\nvoyage--that relation, namely, in virtue of which the voyage makes my\\r\\nbelief true (or, in another case, false). \"reference\" of beliefs differs\\r\\nfrom \"meaning\" of words in various ways, but especially in the fact that\\r\\nit is of two kinds, \"true\" reference and \"false\" reference. the truth\\r\\nor falsehood of a belief does not depend upon anything intrinsic to\\r\\nthe belief, but upon the nature of its relation to its objective. the\\r\\nintrinsic nature of belief can be treated without reference to what\\r\\nmakes it true or false. in the remainder of the present lecture i shall\\r\\nignore truth and falsehood, which will be the subject of lecture xiii.\\r\\nit is the intrinsic nature of belief that will concern us to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * this terminology is suggested by meinong, but is not\\r\\n     exactly the same as his.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) we must distinguish between believing and what is believed. i may\\r\\nbelieve that columbus crossed the atlantic, that all cretans are liars,\\r\\nthat two and two are four, or that nine times six is fifty-six; in\\r\\nall these cases the believing is just the same, and only the contents\\r\\nbelieved are different. i may remember my breakfast this morning, my\\r\\nlecture last week, or my first sight of new york. in all these cases the\\r\\nfeeling of memory-belief is just the same, and only what is remembered\\r\\ndiffers. exactly similar remarks apply to expectations. bare assent,\\r\\nmemory and expectation are forms of belief; all three are different from\\r\\nwhat is believed, and each has a constant character which is independent\\r\\nof what is believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nin lecture i we criticized the analysis of a presentation into act,\\r\\ncontent and object. but our analysis of belief contains three very\\r\\nsimilar elements, namely the believing, what is believed and the\\r\\nobjective. the objections to the act (in the case of presentations)\\r\\nare not valid against the believing in the case of beliefs, because the\\r\\nbelieving is an actual experienced feeling, not something postulated,\\r\\nlike the act. but it is necessary first to complete our preliminary\\r\\nrequisites, and then to examine the content of a belief. after that, we\\r\\nshall be in a position to return to the question as to what constitutes\\r\\nbelieving.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) what is believed, and the believing, must both consist of present\\r\\noccurrences in the believer, no matter what may be the objective of\\r\\nthe belief. suppose i believe, for example, \"that caesar crossed the\\r\\nrubicon.\" the objective of my belief is an event which happened long\\r\\nago, which i never saw and do not remember. this event itself is not in\\r\\nmy mind when i believe that it happened. it is not correct to say that\\r\\ni am believing the actual event; what i am believing is something now\\r\\nin my mind, something related to the event (in a way which we shall\\r\\ninvestigate in lecture xiii), but obviously not to be confounded with\\r\\nthe event, since the event is not occurring now but the believing is.\\r\\nwhat a man is believing at a given moment is wholly determinate if we\\r\\nknow the contents of his mind at that moment; but caesar\\'s crossing of\\r\\nthe rubicon was an historical physical event, which is distinct from the\\r\\npresent contents of every present mind. what is believed, however true\\r\\nit may be, is not the actual fact that makes the belief true, but a\\r\\npresent event related to the fact. this present event, which is what is\\r\\nbelieved, i shall call the \"content\" of the belief. we have already had\\r\\noccasion to notice the distinction between content and objective in the\\r\\ncase of memory-beliefs, where the content is \"this occurred\" and the\\r\\nobjective is the past event.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) between content and objective there is sometimes a very wide gulf,\\r\\nfor example in the case of \"caesar crossed the rubicon.\" this gulf may,\\r\\nwhen it is first perceived, give us a feeling that we cannot really\\r\\n\"know\" anything about the outer world. all we can \"know,\" it may be\\r\\nsaid, is what is now in our thoughts. if caesar and the rubicon cannot\\r\\nbe bodily in our thoughts, it might seem as though we must remain cut\\r\\noff from knowledge of them. i shall not now deal at length with this\\r\\nfeeling, since it is necessary first to define \"knowing,\" which cannot\\r\\nbe done yet. but i will say, as a preliminary answer, that the feeling\\r\\nassumes an ideal of knowing which i believe to be quite mistaken. it\\r\\nassumes, if it is thought out, something like the mystic unity of knower\\r\\nand known. these two are often said to be combined into a unity by the\\r\\nfact of cognition; hence when this unity is plainly absent, it may\\r\\nseem as if there were no genuine cognition. for my part, i think such\\r\\ntheories and feelings wholly mistaken: i believe knowing to be a very\\r\\nexternal and complicated relation, incapable of exact definition,\\r\\ndependent upon causal laws, and involving no more unity than there is\\r\\nbetween a signpost and the town to which it points. i shall return to\\r\\nthis question on a later occasion; for the moment these provisional\\r\\nremarks must suffice.\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) the objective reference of a belief is connected with the fact that\\r\\nall or some of the constituents of its content have meaning. if i say\\r\\n\"caesar conquered gaul,\" a person who knows the meaning of the three\\r\\nwords composing my statement knows as much as can be known about the\\r\\nnature of the objective which would make my statement true. it is clear\\r\\nthat the objective reference of a belief is, in general, in some way\\r\\nderivative from the meanings of the words or images that occur in its\\r\\ncontent. there are, however, certain complications which must be borne\\r\\nin mind. in the first place, it might be contended that a memory-image\\r\\nacquires meaning only through the memory-belief, which would seem, at\\r\\nleast in the case of memory, to make belief more primitive than the\\r\\nmeaning of images. in the second place, it is a very singular thing that\\r\\nmeaning, which is single, should generate objective reference, which is\\r\\ndual, namely true and false. this is one of the facts which any theory\\r\\nof belief must explain if it is to be satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is now time to leave these preliminary requisites, and attempt the\\r\\nanalysis of the contents of beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to notice about what is believed, i.e. about the content\\r\\nof a belief, is that it is always complex: we believe that a certain\\r\\nthing has a certain property, or a certain relation to something else,\\r\\nor that it occurred or will occur (in the sense discussed at the end of\\r\\nlecture ix); or we may believe that all the members of a certain class\\r\\nhave a certain property, or that a certain property sometimes occurs\\r\\namong the members of a class; or we may believe that if one thing\\r\\nhappens, another will happen (for example, \"if it rains i shall bring my\\r\\numbrella\"), or we may believe that something does not happen, or did not\\r\\nor will not happen (for example, \"it won\\'t rain\"); or that one of two\\r\\nthings must happen (for example, \"either you withdraw your accusation,\\r\\nor i shall bring a libel action\"). the catalogue of the sorts of things\\r\\nwe may believe is infinite, but all of them are complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nlanguage sometimes conceals the complexity of a belief. we say that a\\r\\nperson believes in god, and it might seem as if god formed the whole\\r\\ncontent of the belief. but what is really believed is that god exists,\\r\\nwhich is very far from being simple. similarly, when a person has a\\r\\nmemory-image with a memory-belief, the belief is \"this occurred,\" in\\r\\nthe sense explained in lecture ix; and \"this occurred\" is not simple.\\r\\nin like manner all cases where the content of a belief seems simple at\\r\\nfirst sight will be found, on examination, to confirm the view that the\\r\\ncontent is always complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe content of a belief involves not merely a plurality of constituents,\\r\\nbut definite relations between them; it is not determinate when its\\r\\nconstituents alone are given. for example, \"plato preceded aristotle\"\\r\\nand \"aristotle preceded plato\" are both contents which may be believed,\\r\\nbut, although they consist of exactly the same constituents, they are\\r\\ndifferent, and even incompatible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe content of a belief may consist of words only, or of images only, or\\r\\nof a mixture of the two, or of either or both together with one or more\\r\\nsensations. it must contain at least one constituent which is a word\\r\\nor an image, and it may or may not contain one or more sensations as\\r\\nconstituents. some examples will make these various possibilities clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may take first recognition, in either of the forms \"this is of\\r\\nsuch-and-such a kind\" or \"this has occurred before.\" in either case,\\r\\npresent sensation is a constituent. for example, you hear a noise, and\\r\\nyou say to yourself \"tram.\" here the noise and the word \"tram\" are both\\r\\nconstituents of your belief; there is also a relation between them,\\r\\nexpressed by \"is\" in the proposition \"that is a tram.\" as soon as your\\r\\nact of recognition is completed by the occurrence of the word \"tram,\"\\r\\nyour actions are affected: you hurry if you want the tram, or cease to\\r\\nhurry if you want a bus. in this case the content of your belief is a\\r\\nsensation (the noise) and a word (\"tram\") related in a way which may be\\r\\ncalled predication.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same noise may bring into your mind the visual image of a tram,\\r\\ninstead of the word \"tram.\" in this case your belief consists of a\\r\\nsensation and an image suitable related. beliefs of this class are what\\r\\nare called \"judgments of perception.\" as we saw in lecture viii, the\\r\\nimages associated with a sensation often come with such spontaneity\\r\\nand force that the unsophisticated do not distinguish them from the\\r\\nsensation; it is only the psychologist or the skilled observer who is\\r\\naware of the large mnemic element that is added to sensation to make\\r\\nperception. it may be objected that what is added consists merely of\\r\\nimages without belief. this is no doubt sometimes the case, but\\r\\nis certainly sometimes not the case. that belief always occurs in\\r\\nperception as opposed to sensation it is not necessary for us to\\r\\nmaintain; it is enough for our purposes to note that it sometimes\\r\\noccurs, and that when it does, the content of our belief consists of a\\r\\nsensation and an image suitably related.\\r\\n\\r\\nin a pure memory-belief only images occur. but a mixture of words\\r\\nand images is very common in memory. you have an image of the past\\r\\noccurrence, and you say to yourself: \"yes, that\\'s how it was.\" here the\\r\\nimage and the words together make up the content of the belief. and\\r\\nwhen the remembering of an incident has become a habit, it may be purely\\r\\nverbal, and the memory-belief may consist of words alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe more complicated forms of belief tend to consist only of words.\\r\\noften images of various kinds accompany them, but they are apt to\\r\\nbe irrelevant, and to form no part of what is actually believed. for\\r\\nexample, in thinking of the solar system, you are likely to have vague\\r\\nimages of pictures you have seen of the earth surrounded by clouds,\\r\\nsaturn and his rings, the sun during an eclipse, and so on; but none of\\r\\nthese form part of your belief that the planets revolve round the sun\\r\\nin elliptical orbits. the only images that form an actual part of such\\r\\nbeliefs are, as a rule, images of words. and images of words, for the\\r\\nreasons considered in lecture viii, cannot be distinguished with any\\r\\ncertainty from sensations, when, as is often, if not usually, the case,\\r\\nthey are kinaesthetic images of pronouncing the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is impossible for a belief to consist of sensations alone, except\\r\\nwhen, as in the case of words, the sensations have associations which\\r\\nmake them signs possessed of meaning. the reason is that objective\\r\\nreference is of the essence of belief, and objective reference is\\r\\nderived from meaning. when i speak of a belief consisting partly of\\r\\nsensations and partly of words, i do not mean to deny that the words,\\r\\nwhen they are not mere images, are sensational, but that they occur as\\r\\nsigns, not (so to speak) in their own right. to revert to the noise of\\r\\nthe tram, when you hear it and say \"tram,\" the noise and the word are\\r\\nboth sensations (if you actually pronounce the word), but the noise is\\r\\npart of the fact which makes your belief true, whereas the word is not\\r\\npart of this fact. it is the meaning of the word \"tram,\" not the actual\\r\\nword, that forms part of the fact which is the objective of your\\r\\nbelief. thus the word occurs in the belief as a symbol, in virtue of\\r\\nits meaning, whereas the noise enters into both the belief and its\\r\\nobjective. it is this that distinguishes the occurrence of words as\\r\\nsymbols from the occurrence of sensations in their own right: the\\r\\nobjective contains the sensations that occur in their own right, but\\r\\ncontains only the meanings of the words that occur as symbols.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor the sake of simplicity, we may ignore the cases in which sensations\\r\\nin their own right form part of the content of a belief, and confine\\r\\nourselves to images and words. we may also omit the cases in which\\r\\nboth images and words occur in the content of a belief. thus we become\\r\\nconfined to two cases: (a) when the content consists wholly of images,\\r\\n(b) when it consists wholly of words. the case of mixed images and words\\r\\nhas no special importance, and its omission will do no harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take in illustration a case of memory. suppose you are thinking\\r\\nof some familiar room. you may call up an image of it, and in your image\\r\\nthe window may be to the left of the door. without any intrusion of\\r\\nwords, you may believe in the correctness of your image. you then have a\\r\\nbelief, consisting wholly of images, which becomes, when put into words,\\r\\n\"the window is to the left of the door.\" you may yourself use these\\r\\nwords and proceed to believe them. you thus pass from an image-content\\r\\nto the corresponding word-content. the content is different in the two\\r\\ncases, but its objective reference is the same. this shows the relation\\r\\nof image-beliefs to word-beliefs in a very simple case. in more\\r\\nelaborate cases the relation becomes much less simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nit may be said that even in this very simple case the objective\\r\\nreference of the word-content is not quite the same as that of the\\r\\nimage-content, that images have a wealth of concrete features which are\\r\\nlost when words are substituted, that the window in the image is not a\\r\\nmere window in the abstract, but a window of a certain shape and size,\\r\\nnot merely to the left of the door, but a certain distance to the left,\\r\\nand so on. in reply, it may be admitted at once that there is, as a\\r\\nrule, a certain amount of truth in the objection. but two points may be\\r\\nurged to minimize its force. first, images do not, as a rule, have that\\r\\nwealth of concrete detail that would make it impossible to express\\r\\nthem fully in words. they are vague and fragmentary: a finite number\\r\\nof words, though perhaps a large number, would exhaust at least their\\r\\nsignificant features. for--and this is our second point--images enter\\r\\ninto the content of a belief through the fact that they are capable of\\r\\nmeaning, and their meaning does not, as a rule, have as much complexity\\r\\nas they have: some of their characteristics are usually devoid of\\r\\nmeaning. thus it may well be possible to extract in words all that\\r\\nhas meaning in an image-content; in that case the word-content and the\\r\\nimage-content will have exactly the same objective reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe content of a belief, when expressed in words, is the same thing (or\\r\\nvery nearly the same thing) as what in logic is called a \"proposition.\"\\r\\na proposition is a series of words (or sometimes a single word)\\r\\nexpressing the kind of thing that can be asserted or denied. \"that all\\r\\nmen are mortal,\" \"that columbus discovered america,\" \"that charles i\\r\\ndied in his bed,\" \"that all philosophers are wise,\" are propositions.\\r\\nnot any series of words is a proposition, but only such series of words\\r\\nas have \"meaning,\" or, in our phraseology, \"objective reference.\" given\\r\\nthe meanings of separate words, and the rules of syntax, the meaning of\\r\\na proposition is determinate. this is the reason why we can understand\\r\\na sentence we never heard before. you probably never heard before the\\r\\nproposition \"that the inhabitants of the andaman islands habitually\\r\\neat stewed hippopotamus for dinner,\" but there is no difficulty in\\r\\nunderstanding the proposition. the question of the relation between\\r\\nthe meaning of a sentence and the meanings of the separate words is\\r\\ndifficult, and i shall not pursue it now; i brought it up solely as\\r\\nbeing illustrative of the nature of propositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may extend the term \"proposition\" so as to cover the image-contents\\r\\nof beliefs consisting of images. thus, in the case of remembering a\\r\\nroom in which the window is to the left of the door, when we believe the\\r\\nimage-content the proposition will consist of the image of the window\\r\\non the left together with the image of the door on the right. we will\\r\\ndistinguish propositions of this kind as \"image-propositions\"\\r\\nand propositions in words as \"word-propositions.\" we may identify\\r\\npropositions in general with the contents of actual and possible\\r\\nbeliefs, and we may say that it is propositions that are true or false.\\r\\nin logic we are concerned with propositions rather than beliefs, since\\r\\nlogic is not interested in what people do in fact believe, but only\\r\\nin the conditions which determine the truth or falsehood of possible\\r\\nbeliefs. whenever possible, except when actual beliefs are in question,\\r\\nit is generally a simplification to deal with propositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem that image-propositions are more primitive than\\r\\nword-propositions, and may well ante-date language. there is no reason\\r\\nwhy memory-images, accompanied by that very simple belief-feeling which\\r\\nwe decided to be the essence of memory, should not have occurred before\\r\\nlanguage arose; indeed, it would be rash to assert positively that\\r\\nmemory of this sort does not occur among the higher animals. our more\\r\\nelementary beliefs, notably those that are added to sensation to make\\r\\nperception, often remain at the level of images. for example, most of\\r\\nthe visual objects in our neighbourhood rouse tactile images: we have a\\r\\ndifferent feeling in looking at a sofa from what we have in looking at\\r\\na block of marble, and the difference consists chiefly in different\\r\\nstimulation of our tactile imagination. it may be said that the tactile\\r\\nimages are merely present, without any accompanying belief; but i think\\r\\nthis view, though sometimes correct, derives its plausibility as a\\r\\ngeneral proposition from our thinking of explicit conscious belief only.\\r\\nmost of our beliefs, like most of our wishes, are \"unconscious,\" in the\\r\\nsense that we have never told ourselves that we have them. such beliefs\\r\\ndisplay themselves when the expectations that they arouse fail in any\\r\\nway. for example, if someone puts tea (without milk) into a glass, and\\r\\nyou drink it under the impression that it is going to be beer; or if you\\r\\nwalk on what appears to be a tiled floor, and it turns out to be a soft\\r\\ncarpet made to look like tiles. the shock of surprise on an occasion of\\r\\nthis kind makes us aware of the expectations that habitually enter into\\r\\nour perceptions; and such expectations must be classed as beliefs, in\\r\\nspite of the fact that we do not normally take note of them or put them\\r\\ninto words. i remember once watching a cock pigeon running over and over\\r\\nagain to the edge of a looking-glass to try to wreak vengeance on the\\r\\nparticularly obnoxious bird whom he expected to find there, judging by\\r\\nwhat he saw in the glass. he must have experienced each time the sort of\\r\\nsurprise on finding nothing, which is calculated to lead in time to\\r\\nthe adoption of berkeley\\'s theory that objects of sense are only in the\\r\\nmind. his expectation, though not expressed in words, deserved, i think,\\r\\nto be called a belief.\\r\\n\\r\\ni come now to the question what constitutes believing, as opposed to the\\r\\ncontent believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nto begin with, there are various different attitudes that may be taken\\r\\ntowards the same content. let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that\\r\\nyou have a visual image of your breakfast-table. you may expect it while\\r\\nyou are dressing in the morning; remember it as you go to your work;\\r\\nfeel doubt as to its correctness when questioned as to your powers of\\r\\nvisualizing; merely entertain the image, without connecting it with\\r\\nanything external, when you are going to sleep; desire it if you are\\r\\nhungry, or feel aversion for it if you are ill. suppose, for the sake of\\r\\ndefiniteness, that the content is \"an egg for breakfast.\" then you have\\r\\nthe following attitudes \"i expect there will be an egg for breakfast\";\\r\\n\"i remember there was an egg for breakfast\"; \"was there an egg for\\r\\nbreakfast?\" \"an egg for breakfast: well, what of it?\" \"i hope there\\r\\nwill be an egg for breakfast\"; \"i am afraid there will be an egg for\\r\\nbreakfast and it is sure to be bad.\" i do not suggest that this is a\\r\\nlist of all possible attitudes on the subject; i say only that they\\r\\nare different attitudes, all concerned with the one content \"an egg for\\r\\nbreakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthese attitudes are not all equally ultimate. those that involve desire\\r\\nand aversion have occupied us in lecture iii. for the present, we are\\r\\nonly concerned with such as are cognitive. in speaking of memory, we\\r\\ndistinguished three kinds of belief directed towards the same\\r\\ncontent, namely memory, expectation and bare assent without any\\r\\ntime-determination in the belief-feeling. but before developing this\\r\\nview, we must examine two other theories which might be held concerning\\r\\nbelief, and which, in some ways, would be more in harmony with a\\r\\nbehaviourist outlook than the theory i wish to advocate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the first theory to be examined is the view that the differentia of\\r\\nbelief consists in its causal efficacy i do not wish to make any author\\r\\nresponsible for this theory: i wish merely to develop it hypothetically\\r\\nso that we may judge of its tenability.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe defined the meaning of an image or word by causal efficacy, namely by\\r\\nassociations: an image or word acquires meaning, we said, through having\\r\\nthe same associations as what it means.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe propose hypothetically to define \"belief\" by a different kind\\r\\nof causal efficacy, namely efficacy in causing voluntary movements.\\r\\n(voluntary movements are defined as those vital movements which are\\r\\ndistinguished from reflex movements as involving the higher nervous\\r\\ncentres. i do not like to distinguish them by means of such notions as\\r\\n\"consciousness\" or \"will,\" because i do not think these notions, in any\\r\\ndefinable sense, are always applicable. moreover, the purpose of the\\r\\ntheory we are examining is to be, as far as possible, physiological and\\r\\nbehaviourist, and this purpose is not achieved if we introduce such a\\r\\nconception as \"consciousness\" or \"will.\" nevertheless, it is necessary\\r\\nfor our purpose to find some way of distinguishing between voluntary and\\r\\nreflex movements, since the results would be too paradoxical, if we were\\r\\nto say that reflex movements also involve beliefs.) according to this\\r\\ndefinition, a content is said to be \"believed\" when it causes us to\\r\\nmove. the images aroused are the same if you say to me, \"suppose there\\r\\nwere an escaped tiger coming along the street,\" and if you say to me,\\r\\n\"there is an escaped tiger coming along the street.\" but my actions will\\r\\nbe very different in the two cases: in the first, i shall remain calm;\\r\\nin the second, it is possible that i may not. it is suggested, by the\\r\\ntheory we are considering, that this difference of effects constitutes\\r\\nwhat is meant by saying that in the second case i believe the\\r\\nproposition suggested, while in the first case i do not. according\\r\\nto this view, images or words are \"believed\" when they cause bodily\\r\\nmovements.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not think this theory is adequate, but i think it is suggestive\\r\\nof truth, and not so easily refutable as it might appear to be at first\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nit might be objected to the theory that many things which we certainly\\r\\nbelieve do not call for any bodily movements. i believe that great\\r\\nbritain is an island, that whales are mammals, that charles i was\\r\\nexecuted, and so on; and at first sight it seems obvious that such\\r\\nbeliefs, as a rule, do not call for any action on my part. but when we\\r\\ninvestigate the matter more closely, it becomes more doubtful. to begin\\r\\nwith, we must distinguish belief as a mere disposition from actual\\r\\nactive belief. we speak as if we always believed that charles i was\\r\\nexecuted, but that only means that we are always ready to believe it\\r\\nwhen the subject comes up. the phenomenon we are concerned to analyse\\r\\nis the active belief, not the permanent disposition. now, what are\\r\\nthe occasions when, we actively believe that charles i was executed?\\r\\nprimarily: examinations, when we perform the bodily movement of writing\\r\\nit down; conversation, when we assert it to display our historical\\r\\nerudition; and political discourses, when we are engaged in showing what\\r\\nsoviet government leads to. in all these cases bodily movements (writing\\r\\nor speaking) result from our belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there remains the belief which merely occurs in \"thinking.\" one may\\r\\nset to work to recall some piece of history one has been reading, and\\r\\nwhat one recalls is believed, although it probably does not cause any\\r\\nbodily movement whatever. it is true that what we believe always may\\r\\ninfluence action. suppose i am invited to become king of georgia: i find\\r\\nthe prospect attractive, and go to cook\\'s to buy a third-class ticket to\\r\\nmy new realm. at the last moment i remember charles i and all the other\\r\\nmonarchs who have come to a bad end; i change my mind, and walk out\\r\\nwithout completing the transaction. but such incidents are rare, and\\r\\ncannot constitute the whole of my belief that charles i was executed.\\r\\nthe conclusion seems to be that, although a belief always may influence\\r\\naction if it becomes relevant to a practical issue, it often exists\\r\\nactively (not as a mere disposition) without producing any voluntary\\r\\nmovement whatever. if this is true, we cannot define belief by the\\r\\neffect on voluntary movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is another, more theoretical, ground for rejecting the view we\\r\\nare examining. it is clear that a proposition can be either believed or\\r\\nmerely considered, and that the content is the same in both cases. we\\r\\ncan expect an egg for breakfast, or merely entertain the supposition\\r\\nthat there may be an egg for breakfast. a moment ago i considered the\\r\\npossibility of being invited to become king of georgia, but i do not\\r\\nbelieve that this will happen. now, it seems clear that, since believing\\r\\nand considering have different effects if one produces bodily movements\\r\\nwhile the other does not, there must be some intrinsic difference\\r\\nbetween believing and considering*; for if they were precisely similar,\\r\\ntheir effects also would be precisely similar. we have seen that the\\r\\ndifference between believing a given proposition and merely considering\\r\\nit does not lie in the content; therefore there must be, in one case\\r\\nor in both, something additional to the content which distinguishes the\\r\\noccurrence of a belief from the occurrence of a mere consideration\\r\\nof the same content. so far as the theoretical argument goes, this\\r\\nadditional element may exist only in belief, or only in consideration,\\r\\nor there may be one sort of additional element in the case of belief,\\r\\nand another in the case of consideration. this brings us to the second\\r\\nview which we have to examine.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. brentano, \"psychologie vom empirischen standpunkte,\"\\r\\n     p. 268 (criticizing bain, \"the emotions and the will\").\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the theory which we have now to consider regards belief as belonging\\r\\nto every idea which is entertained, except in so far as some positive\\r\\ncounteracting force interferes. in this view belief is not a positive\\r\\nphenomenon, though doubt and disbelief are so. what we call belief,\\r\\naccording to this hypothesis, involves only the appropriate content,\\r\\nwhich will have the effects characteristic of belief unless something\\r\\nelse operating simultaneously inhibits them. james (psychology, vol.\\r\\nii, p. 288) quotes with approval, though inaccurately, a passage from\\r\\nspinoza embodying this view:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"let us conceive a boy imagining to himself a horse, and taking note of\\r\\nnothing else. as this imagination involves the existence of the horse,\\r\\nand the boy has no perception which annuls its existence [james\\'s\\r\\nitalics], he will necessarily contemplate the horse as present, nor will\\r\\nhe be able to doubt of its existence, however little certain of it he\\r\\nmay be. i deny that a man in so far as he imagines [percipit] affirms\\r\\nnothing. for what is it to imagine a winged horse but to affirm that the\\r\\nhorse [that horse, namely] has wings? for if the mind had nothing before\\r\\nit but the winged horse, it would contemplate the same as present, would\\r\\nhave no cause to doubt of its existence, nor any power of dissenting\\r\\nfrom its existence, unless the imagination of the winged horse were\\r\\njoined to an idea which contradicted [tollit] its existence\" (\"ethics,\"\\r\\nvol. ii, p. 49, scholium).\\r\\n\\r\\nto this doctrine james entirely assents, adding in italics:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"any object which remains uncontradicted is ipso facto believed and\\r\\nposited as absolute reality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nif this view is correct, it follows (though james does not draw\\r\\nthe inference) that there is no need of any specific feeling called\\r\\n\"belief,\" and that the mere existence of images yields all that is\\r\\nrequired. the state of mind in which we merely consider a proposition,\\r\\nwithout believing or disbelieving it, will then appear as a\\r\\nsophisticated product, the result of some rival force adding to the\\r\\nimage-proposition a positive feeling which may be called suspense or\\r\\nnon-belief--a feeling which may be compared to that of a man about to\\r\\nrun a race waiting for the signal. such a man, though not moving, is in\\r\\na very different condition from that of a man quietly at rest and so the\\r\\nman who is considering a proposition without believing it will be in\\r\\na state of tension, restraining the natural tendency to act upon the\\r\\nproposition which he would display if nothing interfered. in this view\\r\\nbelief primarily consists merely in the existence of the appropriate\\r\\nimages without any counteracting forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a great deal to be said in favour of this view, and i have some\\r\\nhesitation in regarding it as inadequate. it fits admirably with the\\r\\nphenomena of dreams and hallucinatory images, and it is recommended by\\r\\nthe way in which it accords with mental development. doubt, suspense\\r\\nof judgment and disbelief all seem later and more complex than a wholly\\r\\nunreflecting assent. belief as a positive phenomenon, if it exists,\\r\\nmay be regarded, in this view, as a product of doubt, a decision after\\r\\ndebate, an acceptance, not merely of this, but of this-rather-than-that.\\r\\nit is not difficult to suppose that a dog has images (possible\\r\\nolfactory) of his absent master, or of the rabbit that he dreams of\\r\\nhunting. but it is very difficult to suppose that he can entertain mere\\r\\nimagination-images to which no assent is given.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think it must be conceded that a mere image, without the addition of\\r\\nany positive feeling that could be called \"belief,\" is apt to have a\\r\\ncertain dynamic power, and in this sense an uncombated image has the\\r\\nforce of a belief. but although this may be true, it accounts only for\\r\\nsome of the simplest phenomena in the region of belief. it will not, for\\r\\nexample, explain memory. nor can it explain beliefs which do not issue\\r\\nin any proximate action, such as those of mathematics. i conclude,\\r\\ntherefore, that there must be belief-feelings of the same order as those\\r\\nof doubt or disbelief, although phenomena closely analogous to those of\\r\\nbelief can be produced by mere uncontradicted images.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) i come now to the view of belief which i wish to advocate. it seems\\r\\nto me that there are at least three kinds of belief, namely memory,\\r\\nexpectation and bare assent. each of these i regard as constituted by\\r\\na certain feeling or complex of sensations, attached to the content\\r\\nbelieved. we may illustrate by an example. suppose i am believing,\\r\\nby means of images, not words, that it will rain. we have here two\\r\\ninterrelated elements, namely the content and the expectation. the\\r\\ncontent consists of images of (say) the visual appearance of rain, the\\r\\nfeeling of wetness, the patter of drops, interrelated, roughly, as the\\r\\nsensations would be if it were raining. thus the content is a complex\\r\\nfact composed of images. exactly the same content may enter into the\\r\\nmemory \"it was raining\" or the assent \"rain occurs.\" the difference of\\r\\nthese cases from each other and from expectation does not lie in the\\r\\ncontent. the difference lies in the nature of the belief-feeling.\\r\\ni, personally, do not profess to be able to analyse the sensations\\r\\nconstituting respectively memory, expectation and assent; but i am\\r\\nnot prepared to say that they cannot be analysed. there may be other\\r\\nbelief-feelings, for example in disjunction and implication; also a\\r\\ndisbelief-feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not enough that the content and the belief-feeling should coexist:\\r\\nit is necessary that there should be a specific relation between them,\\r\\nof the sort expressed by saying that the content is what is believed.\\r\\nif this were not obvious, it could be made plain by an argument. if\\r\\nthe mere co-existence of the content and the belief-feeling sufficed,\\r\\nwhenever we were having (say) a memory-feeling we should be remembering\\r\\nany proposition which came into our minds at the same time. but this is\\r\\nnot the case, since we may simultaneously remember one proposition and\\r\\nmerely consider another.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may sum up our analysis, in the case of bare assent to a proposition\\r\\nnot expressed in words, as follows: (a) we have a proposition,\\r\\nconsisting of interrelated images, and possibly partly of sensations;\\r\\n(b) we have the feeling of assent, which is presumably a complex\\r\\nsensation demanding analysis; (c) we have a relation, actually\\r\\nsubsisting, between the assent and the proposition, such as is expressed\\r\\nby saying that the proposition in question is what is assented to. for\\r\\nother forms of belief-feeling or of content, we have only to make the\\r\\nnecessary substitutions in this analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we are right in our analysis of belief, the use of words in\\r\\nexpressing beliefs is apt to be misleading. there is no way of\\r\\ndistinguishing, in words, between a memory and an assent to a\\r\\nproposition about the past: \"i ate my breakfast\" and \"caesar conquered\\r\\ngaul\" have the same verbal form, though (assuming that i remember my\\r\\nbreakfast) they express occurrences which are psychologically very\\r\\ndifferent. in the one case, what happens is that i remember the content\\r\\n\"eating my breakfast\"; in the other case, i assent to the content\\r\\n\"caesar\\'s conquest of gaul occurred.\" in the latter case, but not in the\\r\\nformer, the pastness is part of the content believed. exactly similar\\r\\nremarks apply to the difference between expectation, such as we have\\r\\nwhen waiting for the thunder after a flash of lightning, and assent to a\\r\\nproposition about the future, such as we have in all the usual cases of\\r\\ninferential knowledge as to what will occur. i think this difficulty in\\r\\nthe verbal expression of the temporal aspects of beliefs is one among\\r\\nthe causes which have hampered philosophy in the consideration of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view of belief which i have been advocating contains little that is\\r\\nnovel except the distinction of kinds of belief-feeling--such as memory\\r\\nand expectation. thus james says: \"everyone knows the difference between\\r\\nimagining a thing and believing in its existence, between supposing a\\r\\nproposition and acquiescing in its truth...in its inner nature, belief,\\r\\nor the sense of reality, is a sort of feeling more allied to the\\r\\nemotions than to anything else\" (\"psychology,\" vol. ii, p. 283. james\\'s\\r\\nitalics). he proceeds to point out that drunkenness, and, still more,\\r\\nnitrous-oxide intoxication, will heighten the sense of belief: in the\\r\\nlatter case, he says, a man\\'s very soul may sweat with conviction, and\\r\\nhe be all the time utterly unable to say what he is convinced of. it\\r\\nwould seem that, in such cases, the feeling of belief exists unattached,\\r\\nwithout its usual relation to a content believed, just as the feeling\\r\\nof familiarity may sometimes occur without being related to any definite\\r\\nfamiliar object. the feeling of belief, when it occurs in this separated\\r\\nheightened form, generally leads us to look for a content to which to\\r\\nattach it. much of what passes for revelation or mystic insight probably\\r\\ncomes in this way: the belief-feeling, in abnormal strength, attaches\\r\\nitself, more or less accidentally, to some content which we happen to\\r\\nthink of at the appropriate moment. but this is only a speculation, upon\\r\\nwhich i do not wish to lay too much stress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture xiii. truth and falsehood\\r\\n\\r\\nthe definition of truth and falsehood, which is our topic to-day, lies\\r\\nstrictly outside our general subject, namely the analysis of mind. from\\r\\nthe psychological standpoint, there may be different kinds of belief,\\r\\nand different degrees of certainty, but there cannot be any purely\\r\\npsychological means of distinguishing between true and false beliefs.\\r\\na belief is rendered true or false by relation to a fact, which may lie\\r\\noutside the experience of the person entertaining the belief. truth and\\r\\nfalsehood, except in the case of beliefs about our own minds, depend\\r\\nupon the relations of mental occurrences to outside things, and thus\\r\\ntake us beyond the analysis of mental occurrences as they are in\\r\\nthemselves. nevertheless, we can hardly avoid the consideration of truth\\r\\nand falsehood. we wish to believe that our beliefs, sometimes at least,\\r\\nyield knowledge, and a belief does not yield knowledge unless it is\\r\\ntrue. the question whether our minds are instruments of knowledge, and,\\r\\nif so, in what sense, is so vital that any suggested analysis of mind\\r\\nmust be examined in relation to this question. to ignore this question\\r\\nwould be like describing a chronometer without regard to its accuracy\\r\\nas a time-keeper, or a thermometer without mentioning the fact that it\\r\\nmeasures temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nmany difficult questions arise in connection with knowledge. it is\\r\\ndifficult to define knowledge, difficult to decide whether we have any\\r\\nknowledge, and difficult, even if it is conceded that we sometimes have\\r\\nknowledge to discover whether we can ever know that we have knowledge\\r\\nin this or that particular case. i shall divide the discussion into four\\r\\nparts:\\r\\n\\r\\ni. we may regard knowledge, from a behaviourist standpoint, as exhibited\\r\\nin a certain kind of response to the environment. this response must\\r\\nhave some characteristics which it shares with those of scientific\\r\\ninstruments, but must also have others that are peculiar to knowledge.\\r\\nwe shall find that this point of view is important, but not exhaustive\\r\\nof the nature of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. we may hold that the beliefs that constitute knowledge are\\r\\ndistinguished from such as are erroneous or uncertain by properties\\r\\nwhich are intrinsic either to single beliefs or to systems of beliefs,\\r\\nbeing in either case discoverable without reference to outside fact.\\r\\nviews of this kind have been widely held among philosophers, but we\\r\\nshall find no reason to accept them.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. we believe that some beliefs are true, and some false. this raises\\r\\nthe problem of verifiability: are there any circumstances which can\\r\\njustifiably give us an unusual degree of certainty that such and such a\\r\\nbelief is true? it is obvious that there are circumstances which in fact\\r\\ncause a certainty of this sort, and we wish to learn what we can from\\r\\nexamining these circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\niv. finally, there is the formal problem of defining truth and\\r\\nfalsehood, and deriving the objective reference of a proposition from\\r\\nthe meanings of its component words.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will consider these four problems in succession.\\r\\n\\r\\ni. we may regard a human being as an instrument, which makes various\\r\\nresponses to various stimuli. if we observe these responses from\\r\\noutside, we shall regard them as showing knowledge when they display\\r\\ntwo characteristics, accuracy and appropriateness. these two are quite\\r\\ndistinct, and even sometimes incompatible. if i am being pursued by\\r\\na tiger, accuracy is furthered by turning round to look at him, but\\r\\nappropriateness by running away without making any search for\\r\\nfurther knowledge of the beast. i shall return to the question of\\r\\nappropriateness later; for the present it is accuracy that i wish to\\r\\nconsider.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we are viewing a man from the outside, it is not his beliefs,\\r\\nbut his bodily movements, that we can observe. his knowledge must be\\r\\ninferred from his bodily movements, and especially from what he says\\r\\nand writes. for the present we may ignore beliefs, and regard a man\\'s\\r\\nknowledge as actually consisting in what he says and does. that is to\\r\\nsay, we will construct, as far as possible, a purely behaviouristic\\r\\naccount of truth and falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you ask a boy \"what is twice two?\" and the boy says \"four,\" you take\\r\\nthat as prima facie evidence that the boy knows what twice two is. but\\r\\nif you go on to ask what is twice three, twice four, twice five, and so\\r\\non, and the boy always answers \"four,\" you come to the conclusion that\\r\\nhe knows nothing about it. exactly similar remarks apply to scientific\\r\\ninstruments. i know a certain weather-cock which has the pessimistic\\r\\nhabit of always pointing to the north-east. if you were to see it first\\r\\non a cold march day, you would think it an excellent weather-cock; but\\r\\nwith the first warm day of spring your confidence would be shaken. the\\r\\nboy and the weather-cock have the same defect: they do not vary their\\r\\nresponse when the stimulus is varied. a good instrument, or a person\\r\\nwith much knowledge, will give different responses to stimuli which\\r\\ndiffer in relevant ways. this is the first point in defining accuracy of\\r\\nresponse.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will now assume another boy, who also, when you first question him,\\r\\nasserts that twice two is four. but with this boy, instead of asking him\\r\\ndifferent questions, you make a practice of asking him the same question\\r\\nevery day at breakfast. you find that he says five, or six, or seven, or\\r\\nany other number at random, and you conclude that he also does not know\\r\\nwhat twice two is, though by good luck he answered right the first time.\\r\\nthis boy is like a weather-cock which, instead of being stuck fast, is\\r\\nalways going round and round, changing without any change of wind. this\\r\\nboy and weather-cock have the opposite defect to that of the previous\\r\\npair: they give different responses to stimuli which do not differ in\\r\\nany relevant way.\\r\\n\\r\\nin connection with vagueness in memory, we already had occasion to\\r\\nconsider the definition of accuracy. omitting some of the niceties of\\r\\nour previous discussion, we may say that an instrument is accurate when\\r\\nit avoids the defects of the two boys and weather-cocks, that is to say,\\r\\nwhen--\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) it gives different responses to stimuli which differ in relevant\\r\\nways;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) it gives the same response to stimuli which do not differ in\\r\\nrelevant ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat are relevant ways depends upon the nature and purpose of the\\r\\ninstrument. in the case of a weather-cock, the direction of the wind is\\r\\nrelevant, but not its strength; in the case of the boy, the meaning of\\r\\nthe words of your question is relevant, but not the loudness of your\\r\\nvoice, or whether you are his father or his schoolmaster if, however,\\r\\nyou were a boy of his own age, that would be relevant, and the\\r\\nappropriate response would be different.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is clear that knowledge is displayed by accuracy of response to\\r\\ncertain kinds of stimuli, e.g. examinations. can we say, conversely,\\r\\nthat it consists wholly of such accuracy of response? i do not think\\r\\nwe can; but we can go a certain distance in this direction. for this\\r\\npurpose we must define more carefully the kind of accuracy and the kind\\r\\nof response that may be expected where there is knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom our present point of view, it is difficult to exclude perception\\r\\nfrom knowledge; at any rate, knowledge is displayed by actions based\\r\\nupon perception. a bird flying among trees avoids bumping into their\\r\\nbranches; its avoidance is a response to visual sensations. this\\r\\nresponse has the characteristic of accuracy, in the main, and leads\\r\\nus to say that the bird \"knows,\" by sight, what objects are in its\\r\\nneighbourhood. for a behaviourist, this must certainly count as\\r\\nknowledge, however it may be viewed by analytic psychology. in this\\r\\ncase, what is known, roughly, is the stimulus; but in more advanced\\r\\nknowledge the stimulus and what is known become different. for example,\\r\\nyou look in your calendar and find that easter will be early next year.\\r\\nhere the stimulus is the calendar, whereas the response concerns the\\r\\nfuture. even this can be paralleled among instruments: the behaviour of\\r\\nthe barometer has a present stimulus but foretells the future, so that\\r\\nthe barometer might be said, in a sense, to know the future. however\\r\\nthat may be, the point i am emphasizing as regards knowledge is that\\r\\nwhat is known may be quite different from the stimulus, and no part of\\r\\nthe cause of the knowledge-response. it is only in sense-knowledge that\\r\\nthe stimulus and what is known are, with qualifications, identifiable.\\r\\nin knowledge of the future, it is obvious that they are totally\\r\\ndistinct, since otherwise the response would precede the stimulus. in\\r\\nabstract knowledge also they are distinct, since abstract facts have no\\r\\ndate. in knowledge of the past there are complications, which we must\\r\\nbriefly examine.\\r\\n\\r\\nevery form of memory will be, from our present point of view, in one\\r\\nsense a delayed response. but this phrase does not quite clearly\\r\\nexpress what is meant. if you light a fuse and connect it with a heap of\\r\\ndynamite, the explosion of the dynamite may be spoken of, in a sense,\\r\\nas a delayed response to your lighting of the fuse. but that only means\\r\\nthat it is a somewhat late portion of a continuous process of which the\\r\\nearlier parts have less emotional interest. this is not the case\\r\\nwith habit. a display of habit has two sorts of causes: (a) the past\\r\\noccurrences which generated the habit, (b) the present occurrence which\\r\\nbrings it into play. when you drop a weight on your toe, and say what\\r\\nyou do say, the habit has been caused by imitation of your undesirable\\r\\nassociates, whereas it is brought into play by the dropping of the\\r\\nweight. the great bulk of our knowledge is a habit in this sense:\\r\\nwhenever i am asked when i was born, i reply correctly by mere habit. it\\r\\nwould hardly be correct to say that getting born was the stimulus, and\\r\\nthat my reply is a delayed response but in cases of memory this way\\r\\nof speaking would have an element of truth. in an habitual memory, the\\r\\nevent remembered was clearly an essential part of the stimulus to the\\r\\nformation of the habit. the present stimulus which brings the habit into\\r\\nplay produces a different response from that which it would produce if\\r\\nthe habit did not exist. therefore the habit enters into the causation\\r\\nof the response, and so do, at one remove, the causes of the habit. it\\r\\nfollows that an event remembered is an essential part of the causes of\\r\\nour remembering.\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite, however, of the fact that what is known is sometimes an\\r\\nindispensable part of the cause of the knowledge, this circumstance is,\\r\\ni think, irrelevant to the general question with which we are concerned,\\r\\nnamely what sort of response to what sort of stimulus can be regarded\\r\\nas displaying knowledge? there is one characteristic which the response\\r\\nmust have, namely, it must consist of voluntary movements. the need\\r\\nof this characteristic is connected with the characteristic of\\r\\nappropriateness, which i do not wish to consider as yet. for the present\\r\\ni wish only to obtain a clearer idea of the sort of accuracy that a\\r\\nknowledge-response must have. it is clear from many instances that\\r\\naccuracy, in other cases, may be purely mechanical. the most complete\\r\\nform of accuracy consists in giving correct answers to questions, an\\r\\nachievement in which calculating machines far surpass human beings. in\\r\\nasking a question of a calculating machine, you must use its language:\\r\\nyou must not address it in english, any more than you would address\\r\\nan englishman in chinese. but if you address it in the language it\\r\\nunderstands, it will tell you what is 34521 times 19987, without a\\r\\nmoment\\'s hesitation or a hint of inaccuracy. we do not say the machine\\r\\nknows the answer, because it has no purpose of its own in giving the\\r\\nanswer: it does not wish to impress you with its cleverness, or feel\\r\\nproud of being such a good machine. but as far as mere accuracy goes,\\r\\nthe machine leaves nothing to be desired.\\r\\n\\r\\naccuracy of response is a perfectly clear notion in the case of answers\\r\\nto questions, but in other cases it is much more obscure. we may say\\r\\ngenerally that an object whether animate or inanimate, is \"sensitive\" to\\r\\na certain feature of the environment if it behaves differently according\\r\\nto the presence or absence of that feature. thus iron is sensitive to\\r\\nanything magnetic. but sensitiveness does not constitute knowledge, and\\r\\nknowledge of a fact which is not sensible is not sensitiveness to\\r\\nthat fact, as we have seen in distinguishing the fact known from the\\r\\nstimulus. as soon as we pass beyond the simple case of question and\\r\\nanswer, the definition of knowledge by means of behaviour demands the\\r\\nconsideration of purpose. a carrier pigeon flies home, and so we say\\r\\nit \"knows\" the way. but if it merely flew to some place at random, we\\r\\nshould not say that it \"knew\" the way to that place, any more than a\\r\\nstone rolling down hill knows the way to the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\non the features which distinguish knowledge from accuracy of response in\\r\\ngeneral, not much can be said from a behaviourist point of view without\\r\\nreferring to purpose. but the necessity of something besides accuracy of\\r\\nresponse may be brought out by the following consideration: suppose\\r\\ntwo persons, of whom one believed whatever the other disbelieved,\\r\\nand disbelieved whatever the other believed. so far as accuracy and\\r\\nsensitiveness of response alone are concerned, there would be nothing to\\r\\nchoose between these two persons. a thermometer which went down for warm\\r\\nweather and up for cold might be just as accurate as the usual kind; and\\r\\na person who always believes falsely is just as sensitive an instrument\\r\\nas a person who always believes truly. the observable and practical\\r\\ndifference between them would be that the one who always believed\\r\\nfalsely would quickly come to a bad end. this illustrates once more that\\r\\naccuracy of response to stimulus does not alone show knowledge, but must\\r\\nbe reinforced by appropriateness, i.e. suitability for realizing one\\'s\\r\\npurpose. this applies even in the apparently simple case of answering\\r\\nquestions: if the purpose of the answers is to deceive, their falsehood,\\r\\nnot their truth, will be evidence of knowledge. the proportion of\\r\\nthe combination of appropriateness with accuracy in the definition\\r\\nof knowledge is difficult; it seems that both enter in, but that\\r\\nappropriateness is only required as regards the general type of\\r\\nresponse, not as regards each individual instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. i have so far assumed as unquestionable the view that the truth or\\r\\nfalsehood of a belief consists in a relation to a certain fact,\\r\\nnamely the objective of the belief. this view has, however, been often\\r\\nquestioned. philosophers have sought some intrinsic criterion by which\\r\\ntrue and false beliefs could be distinguished.* i am afraid their chief\\r\\nreason for this search has been the wish to feel more certainty than\\r\\nseems otherwise possible as to what is true and what is false. if\\r\\nwe could discover the truth of a belief by examining its intrinsic\\r\\ncharacteristics, or those of some collection of beliefs of which it\\r\\nforms part, the pursuit of truth, it is thought, would be a less arduous\\r\\nbusiness than it otherwise appears to be. but the attempts which\\r\\nhave been made in this direction are not encouraging. i will take two\\r\\ncriteria which have been suggested, namely, (1) self-evidence, (2)\\r\\nmutual coherence. if we can show that these are inadequate, we may\\r\\nfeel fairly certain that no intrinsic criterion hitherto suggested will\\r\\nsuffice to distinguish true from false beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * the view that such a criterion exists is generally held by\\r\\n     those whose views are in any degree derived from hegel. it\\r\\n     may be illustrated by the following passage from lossky,\\r\\n     \"the intuitive basis of knowledge\" (macmillan, 1919), p.\\r\\n     268: \"strictly speaking, a false judgment is not a judgment\\r\\n     at all. the predicate does not follow from the subject s\\r\\n     alone, but from the subject plus a certain addition c, which\\r\\n     in no sense belongs to the content of the judgment. what\\r\\n     takes place may be a process of association of ideas, of\\r\\n     imagining, or the like, but is not a process of judging. an\\r\\n     experienced psychologist will be able by careful observation\\r\\n     to detect that in this process there is wanting just the\\r\\n     specific element of the objective dependence of the\\r\\n     predicate upon the subject which is characteristic of a\\r\\n     judgment. it must be admitted, however, that an exceptional\\r\\n     power of observation is needed in order to distinguish, by\\r\\n     means of introspection, mere combination of ideas from\\r\\n     judgments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) self-evidence.--some of our beliefs seem to be peculiarly\\r\\nindubitable. one might instance the belief that two and two are four,\\r\\nthat two things cannot be in the same place at the same time, nor one\\r\\nthing in two places, or that a particular buttercup that we are seeing\\r\\nis yellow. the suggestion we are to examine is that such: beliefs have\\r\\nsome recognizable quality which secures their truth, and the truth of\\r\\nwhatever is deduced from them according to self-evident principles of\\r\\ninference. this theory is set forth, for example, by meinong in his\\r\\nbook, \"ueber die erfahrungsgrundlagen unseres wissens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nif this theory is to be logically tenable, self-evidence must not\\r\\nconsist merely in the fact that we believe a proposition. we believe\\r\\nthat our beliefs are sometimes erroneous, and we wish to be able to\\r\\nselect a certain class of beliefs which are never erroneous. if we\\r\\nare to do this, it must be by some mark which belongs only to certain\\r\\nbeliefs, not to all; and among those to which it belongs there must be\\r\\nnone that are mutually inconsistent. if, for example, two propositions\\r\\np and q were self-evident, and it were also self-evident that p and q\\r\\ncould not both be true, that would condemn self-evidence as a guarantee\\r\\nof truth. again, self-evidence must not be the same thing as the absence\\r\\nof doubt or the presence of complete certainty. if we are completely\\r\\ncertain of a proposition, we do not seek a ground to support our belief.\\r\\nif self-evidence is alleged as a ground of belief, that implies that\\r\\ndoubt has crept in, and that our self-evident proposition has not\\r\\nwholly resisted the assaults of scepticism. to say that any given person\\r\\nbelieves some things so firmly that he cannot be made to doubt them is\\r\\nno doubt true. such beliefs he will be willing to use as premisses in\\r\\nreasoning, and to him personally they will seem to have as much evidence\\r\\nas any belief can need. but among the propositions which one man finds\\r\\nindubitable there will be some that another man finds it quite possible\\r\\nto doubt. it used to seem self-evident that there could not be men at\\r\\nthe antipodes, because they would fall off, or at best grow giddy from\\r\\nstanding on their heads. but new zealanders find the falsehood of this\\r\\nproposition self-evident. therefore, if self-evidence is a guarantee of\\r\\ntruth, our ancestors must have been mistaken in thinking their beliefs\\r\\nabout the antipodes self-evident. meinong meets this difficulty by\\r\\nsaying that some beliefs are falsely thought to be self-evident, but in\\r\\nthe case of others it is self-evident that they are self-evident, and\\r\\nthese are wholly reliable. even this, however, does not remove the\\r\\npractical risk of error, since we may mistakenly believe it self-evident\\r\\nthat a certain belief is self-evident. to remove all risk of error, we\\r\\nshall need an endless series of more and more complicated self-evident\\r\\nbeliefs, which cannot possibly be realized in practice. it would seem,\\r\\ntherefore, that self-evidence is useless as a practical criterion for\\r\\ninsuring truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same result follows from examining instances. if we take the four\\r\\ninstances mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, we shall\\r\\nfind that three of them are logical, while the fourth is a judgment of\\r\\nperception. the proposition that two and two are four follows by purely\\r\\nlogical deduction from definitions: that means that its truth results,\\r\\nnot from the properties of objects, but from the meanings of symbols.\\r\\nnow symbols, in mathematics, mean what we choose; thus the feeling of\\r\\nself-evidence, in this case, seems explicable by the fact that the whole\\r\\nmatter is within our control. i do not wish to assert that this is\\r\\nthe whole truth about mathematical propositions, for the question is\\r\\ncomplicated, and i do not know what the whole truth is. but i do wish to\\r\\nsuggest that the feeling of self-evidence in mathematical propositions\\r\\nhas to do with the fact that they are concerned with the meanings of\\r\\nsymbols, not with properties of the world such as external observation\\r\\nmight reveal.\\r\\n\\r\\nsimilar considerations apply to the impossibility of a thing being in\\r\\ntwo places at once, or of two things being in one place at the same\\r\\ntime. these impossibilities result logically, if i am not mistaken, from\\r\\nthe definitions of one thing and one place. that is to say, they are not\\r\\nlaws of physics, but only part of the intellectual apparatus which we\\r\\nhave manufactured for manipulating physics. their self-evidence, if this\\r\\nis so, lies merely in the fact that they represent our decision as to\\r\\nthe use of words, not a property of physical objects.\\r\\n\\r\\njudgments of perception, such as \"this buttercup is yellow,\" are in\\r\\na quite different position from judgments of logic, and their\\r\\nself-evidence must have a different explanation. in order to arrive at\\r\\nthe nucleus of such a judgment, we will eliminate, as far as possible,\\r\\nthe use of words which take us beyond the present fact, such as\\r\\n\"buttercup\" and \"yellow.\" the simplest kind of judgment underlying the\\r\\nperception that a buttercup is yellow would seem to be the perception of\\r\\nsimilarity in two colours seen simultaneously. suppose we are seeing\\r\\ntwo buttercups, and we perceive that their colours are similar. this\\r\\nsimilarity is a physical fact, not a matter of symbols or words; and it\\r\\ncertainly seems to be indubitable in a way that many judgments are not.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to observe, in regard to such judgments, is that as they\\r\\nstand they are vague. the word \"similar\" is a vague word, since there\\r\\nare degrees of similarity, and no one can say where similarity ends\\r\\nand dissimilarity begins. it is unlikely that our two buttercups have\\r\\nexactly the same colour, and if we judged that they had we should have\\r\\npassed altogether outside the region of self-evidence. to make our\\r\\nproposition more precise, let us suppose that we are also seeing a\\r\\nred rose at the same time. then we may judge that the colours of the\\r\\nbuttercups are more similar to each other than to the colour of the\\r\\nrose. this judgment seems more complicated, but has certainly gained\\r\\nin precision. even now, however, it falls short of complete precision,\\r\\nsince similarity is not prima facie measurable, and it would require\\r\\nmuch discussion to decide what we mean by greater or less similarity. to\\r\\nthis process of the pursuit of precision there is strictly no limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next thing to observe (although i do not personally doubt that most\\r\\nof our judgments of perception are true) is that it is very difficult to\\r\\ndefine any class of such judgments which can be known, by its intrinsic\\r\\nquality, to be always exempt from error. most of our judgments of\\r\\nperception involve correlations, as when we judge that a certain noise\\r\\nis that of a passing cart. such judgments are all obviously liable to\\r\\nerror, since there is no correlation of which we have a right to be\\r\\ncertain that it is invariable. other judgments of perception are derived\\r\\nfrom recognition, as when we say \"this is a buttercup,\" or even merely\\r\\n\"this is yellow.\" all such judgments entail some risk of error,\\r\\nthough sometimes perhaps a very small one; some flowers that look like\\r\\nbuttercups are marigolds, and colours that some would call yellow others\\r\\nmight call orange. our subjective certainty is usually a result of\\r\\nhabit, and may lead us astray in circumstances which are unusual in ways\\r\\nof which we are unaware.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor such reasons, no form of self-evidence seems to afford an absolute\\r\\ncriterion of truth. nevertheless, it is perhaps true that judgments\\r\\nhaving a high degree of subjective certainty are more apt to be true\\r\\nthan other judgments. but if this be the case, it is a result to be\\r\\ndemonstrated, not a premiss from which to start in defining truth and\\r\\nfalsehood. as an initial guarantee, therefore, neither self-evidence nor\\r\\nsubjective certainty can be accepted as adequate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) coherence.--coherence as the definition of truth is advocated by\\r\\nidealists, particularly by those who in the main follow hegel. it is set\\r\\nforth ably in mr. joachim\\'s book, \"the nature of truth\" (oxford, 1906).\\r\\naccording to this view, any set of propositions other than the whole\\r\\nof truth can be condemned on purely logical grounds, as internally\\r\\ninconsistent; a single proposition, if it is what we should ordinarily\\r\\ncall false, contradicts itself irremediably, while if it is what we\\r\\nshould ordinarily call true, it has implications which compel us to\\r\\nadmit other propositions, which in turn lead to others, and so on, until\\r\\nwe find ourselves committed to the whole of truth. one might illustrate\\r\\nby a very simple example: if i say \"so-and-so is a married man,\" that\\r\\nis not a self-subsistent proposition. we cannot logically conceive of a\\r\\nuniverse in which this proposition constituted the whole of truth. there\\r\\nmust be also someone who is a married woman, and who is married to\\r\\nthe particular man in question. the view we are considering regards\\r\\neverything that can be said about any one object as relative in the same\\r\\nsort of way as \"so-and-so is a married man.\" but everything, according\\r\\nto this view, is relative, not to one or two other things, but to all\\r\\nother things, so that from one bit of truth the whole can be inferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fundamental objection to this view is logical, and consists in a\\r\\ncriticism of its doctrine as to relations. i shall omit this line of\\r\\nargument, which i have developed elsewhere.* for the moment i will\\r\\ncontent myself with saying that the powers of logic seem to me very\\r\\nmuch less than this theory supposes. if it were taken seriously, its\\r\\nadvocates ought to profess that any one truth is logically inferable\\r\\nfrom any other, and that, for example, the fact that caesar conquered\\r\\ngaul, if adequately considered, would enable us to discover what the\\r\\nweather will be to-morrow. no such claim is put forward in practice, and\\r\\nthe necessity of empirical observation is not denied; but according to\\r\\nthe theory it ought to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * in the article on \"the monistic theory of truth\" in\\r\\n     \"philosophical essays\" (longmans, 1910), reprinted from the\\r\\n     \"proceedings of the aristotelian society,\" 1906-7.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother objection is that no endeavour is made to show that we cannot\\r\\nform a consistent whole composed partly or wholly of false propositions,\\r\\nas in a novel. leibniz\\'s conception of many possible worlds seems to\\r\\naccord much better with modern logic and with the practical empiricism\\r\\nwhich is now universal. the attempt to deduce the world by pure thought\\r\\nis attractive, and in former times was largely supposed capable of\\r\\nsuccess. but nowadays most men admit that beliefs must be tested by\\r\\nobservation, and not merely by the fact that they harmonize with other\\r\\nbeliefs. a consistent fairy-tale is a different thing from truth,\\r\\nhowever elaborate it may be. but to pursue this topic would lead us\\r\\ninto difficult technicalities; i shall therefore assume, without further\\r\\nargument, that coherence is not sufficient as a definition of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. many difficult problems arise as regards the verifiability of\\r\\nbeliefs. we believe various things, and while we believe them we think\\r\\nwe know them. but it sometimes turns out that we were mistaken, or at\\r\\nany rate we come to think we were. we must be mistaken either in our\\r\\nprevious opinion or in our subsequent recantation; therefore our beliefs\\r\\nare not all correct, and there are cases of belief which are not cases\\r\\nof knowledge. the question of verifiability is in essence this: can we\\r\\ndiscover any set of beliefs which are never mistaken or any test which,\\r\\nwhen applicable, will always enable us to discriminate between true\\r\\nand false beliefs? put thus broadly and abstractly, the answer must be\\r\\nnegative. there is no way hitherto discovered of wholly eliminating the\\r\\nrisk of error, and no infallible criterion. if we believe we have found\\r\\na criterion, this belief itself may be mistaken; we should be begging\\r\\nthe question if we tried to test the criterion by applying the criterion\\r\\nto itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut although the notion of an absolute criterion is chimerical, there\\r\\nmay be relative criteria, which increase the probability of truth.\\r\\ncommon sense and science hold that there are. let us see what they have\\r\\nto say.\\r\\n\\r\\none of the plainest cases of verification, perhaps ultimately the only\\r\\ncase, consists in the happening of something expected. you go to the\\r\\nstation believing that there will be a train at a certain time; you\\r\\nfind the train, you get into it, and it starts at the expected time this\\r\\nconstitutes verification, and is a perfectly definite experience. it is,\\r\\nin a sense, the converse of memory instead of having first sensations\\r\\nand then images accompanied by belief, we have first images accompanied\\r\\nby belief and then sensations. apart from differences as to the\\r\\ntime-order and the accompanying feelings, the relation between image and\\r\\nsensation is closely similar in the two cases of memory and expectation;\\r\\nit is a relation of similarity, with difference as to causal\\r\\nefficacy--broadly, the image has the psychological but not the physical\\r\\neffects that the sensation would have. when an image accompanied by\\r\\nan expectation-belief is thus succeeded by a sensation which is the\\r\\n\"meaning\" of the image, we say that the expectation-belief has been\\r\\nverified. the experience of verification in this sense is exceedingly\\r\\nfamiliar; it happens every time that accustomed activities have results\\r\\nthat are not surprising, in eating and walking and talking and all our\\r\\ndaily pursuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut although the experience in question is common, it is not wholly easy\\r\\nto give a theoretical account of it. how do we know that the sensation\\r\\nresembles the previous image? does the image persist in presence of the\\r\\nsensation, so that we can compare the two? and even if some image does\\r\\npersist, how do we know that it is the previous image unchanged? it does\\r\\nnot seem as if this line of inquiry offered much hope of a successful\\r\\nissue. it is better, i think, to take a more external and causal view of\\r\\nthe relation of expectation to expected occurrence. if the occurrence,\\r\\nwhen it comes, gives us the feeling of expectedness, and if the\\r\\nexpectation, beforehand, enabled us to act in a way which proves\\r\\nappropriate to the occurrence, that must be held to constitute the\\r\\nmaximum of verification. we have first an expectation, then a sensation\\r\\nwith the feeling of expectedness related to memory of the expectation.\\r\\nthis whole experience, when it occurs, may be defined as verification,\\r\\nand as constituting the truth of the expectation. appropriate action,\\r\\nduring the period of expectation, may be regarded as additional\\r\\nverification, but is not essential. the whole process may be illustrated\\r\\nby looking up a familiar quotation, finding it in the expected words,\\r\\nand in the expected part of the book. in this case we can strengthen\\r\\nthe verification by writing down beforehand the words which we expect to\\r\\nfind.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think all verification is ultimately of the above sort. we verify a\\r\\nscientific hypothesis indirectly, by deducing consequences as to the\\r\\nfuture, which subsequent experience confirms. if somebody were to doubt\\r\\nwhether caesar had crossed the rubicon, verification could only be\\r\\nobtained from the future. we could proceed to display manuscripts to our\\r\\nhistorical sceptic, in which it was said that caesar had behaved in this\\r\\nway. we could advance arguments, verifiable by future experience, to\\r\\nprove the antiquity of the manuscript from its texture, colour, etc. we\\r\\ncould find inscriptions agreeing with the historian on other points,\\r\\nand tending to show his general accuracy. the causal laws which our\\r\\narguments would assume could be verified by the future occurrence of\\r\\nevents inferred by means of them. the existence and persistence of\\r\\ncausal laws, it is true, must be regarded as a fortunate accident, and\\r\\nhow long it will continue we cannot tell. meanwhile verification remains\\r\\noften practically possible. and since it is sometimes possible, we\\r\\ncan gradually discover what kinds of beliefs tend to be verified by\\r\\nexperience, and what kinds tend to be falsified; to the former kinds\\r\\nwe give an increased degree of assent, to the latter kinds a diminished\\r\\ndegree. the process is not absolute or infallible, but it has been\\r\\nfound capable of sifting beliefs and building up science. it affords\\r\\nno theoretical refutation of the sceptic, whose position must remain\\r\\nlogically unassailable; but if complete scepticism is rejected, it gives\\r\\nthe practical method by which the system of our beliefs grows gradually\\r\\ntowards the unattainable ideal of impeccable knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\niv. i come now to the purely formal definition of the truth or falsehood\\r\\nof a belief. for this definition it is necessary first of all to\\r\\nconsider the derivation of the objective reference of a proposition from\\r\\nthe meanings of its component words or images.\\r\\n\\r\\njust as a word has meaning, so a proposition has an objective reference.\\r\\nthe objective reference of a proposition is a function (in the\\r\\nmathematical sense) of the meanings of its component words. but the\\r\\nobjective reference differs from the meaning of a word through the\\r\\nduality of truth and falsehood. you may believe the proposition \"to-day\\r\\nis tuesday\" both when, in fact, to-day is tuesday, and when to-day is\\r\\nnot tuesday. if to-day is not tuesday, this fact is the objective of\\r\\nyour belief that to-day is tuesday. but obviously the relation of your\\r\\nbelief to the fact is different in this case from what it is in the case\\r\\nwhen to-day is tuesday. we may say, metaphorically, that when to-day is\\r\\ntuesday, your belief that it is tuesday points towards the fact, whereas\\r\\nwhen to-day is not tuesday your belief points away from the fact. thus\\r\\nthe objective reference of a belief is not determined by the fact alone,\\r\\nbut by the direction of the belief towards or away from the fact.* if,\\r\\non a tuesday, one man believes that it is tuesday while another believes\\r\\nthat it is not tuesday, their beliefs have the same objective, namely\\r\\nthe fact that it is tuesday but the true belief points towards the fact\\r\\nwhile the false one points away from it. thus, in order to define the\\r\\nreference of a proposition we have to take account not only of the\\r\\nobjective, but also of the direction of pointing, towards the objective\\r\\nin the case of a true proposition and away from it in the case of a\\r\\nfalse one.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * i owe this way of looking at the matter to my friend\\r\\n     ludwig wittgenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis mode of stating the nature of the objective reference of a\\r\\nproposition is necessitated by the circumstance that there are true and\\r\\nfalse propositions, but not true and false facts. if to-day is tuesday,\\r\\nthere is not a false objective \"to-day is not tuesday,\" which could be\\r\\nthe objective of the false belief \"to-day is not tuesday.\" this is the\\r\\nreason why two beliefs which are each other\\'s contradictories have the\\r\\nsame objective. there is, however, a practical inconvenience, namely\\r\\nthat we cannot determine the objective reference of a proposition,\\r\\naccording to this definition, unless we know whether the proposition\\r\\nis true or false. to avoid this inconvenience, it is better to adopt\\r\\na slightly different phraseology, and say: the \"meaning\" of the\\r\\nproposition \"to-day is tuesday\" consists in pointing to the fact \"to-day\\r\\nis tuesday\" if that is a fact, or away from the fact \"to-day is not\\r\\ntuesday\" if that is a fact. the \"meaning\" of the proposition \"to-day is\\r\\nnot tuesday\" will be exactly the opposite. by this hypothetical form\\r\\nwe are able to speak of the meaning of a proposition without knowing\\r\\nwhether it is true or false. according to this definition, we know the\\r\\nmeaning of a proposition when we know what would make it true and what\\r\\nwould make it false, even if we do not know whether it is in fact true\\r\\nor false.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe meaning of a proposition is derivative from the meanings of its\\r\\nconstituent words. propositions occur in pairs, distinguished (in\\r\\nsimple cases) by the absence or presence of the word \"not.\" two such\\r\\npropositions have the same objective, but opposite meanings: when one is\\r\\ntrue, the other is false, and when one is false, the other is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe purely formal definition of truth and falsehood offers little\\r\\ndifficulty. what is required is a formal expression of the fact that a\\r\\nproposition is true when it points towards its objective, and false when\\r\\nit points away from it, in very simple cases we can give a very simple\\r\\naccount of this: we can say that true propositions actually resemble\\r\\ntheir objectives in a way in which false propositions do not. but for\\r\\nthis purpose it is necessary to revert to image-propositions instead of\\r\\nword-propositions. let us take again the illustration of a memory-image\\r\\nof a familiar room, and let us suppose that in the image the window is\\r\\nto the left of the door. if in fact the window is to the left of the\\r\\ndoor, there is a correspondence between the image and the objective;\\r\\nthere is the same relation between the window and the door as between\\r\\nthe images of them. the image-memory consists of the image of the window\\r\\nto the left of the image of the door. when this is true, the very same\\r\\nrelation relates the terms of the objective (namely the window and\\r\\nthe door) as relates the images which mean them. in this case the\\r\\ncorrespondence which constitutes truth is very simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the case we have just been considering the objective consists of\\r\\ntwo parts with a certain relation (that of left-to-right), and the\\r\\nproposition consists of images of these parts with the very same\\r\\nrelation. the same proposition, if it were false, would have a less\\r\\nsimple formal relation to its objective. if the image-proposition\\r\\nconsists of an image of the window to the left of an image of the door,\\r\\nwhile in fact the window is not to the left of the door, the proposition\\r\\ndoes not result from the objective by the mere substitution of images\\r\\nfor their prototypes. thus in this unusually simple case we can say that\\r\\na true proposition \"corresponds\" to its objective in a formal sense in\\r\\nwhich a false proposition does not. perhaps it may be possible to modify\\r\\nthis notion of formal correspondence in such a way as to be more widely\\r\\napplicable, but if so, the modifications required will be by no means\\r\\nslight. the reasons for this must now be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nto begin with, the simple type of correspondence we have been exhibiting\\r\\ncan hardly occur when words are substituted for images, because, in\\r\\nword-propositions, relations are usually expressed by words, which are\\r\\nnot themselves relations. take such a proposition as \"socrates\\r\\nprecedes plato.\" here the word \"precedes\" is just as solid as the words\\r\\n\"socrates\" and \"plato\"; it means a relation, but is not a relation. thus\\r\\nthe objective which makes our proposition true consists of two terms\\r\\nwith a relation between them, whereas our proposition consists of three\\r\\nterms with a relation of order between them. of course, it would be\\r\\nperfectly possible, theoretically, to indicate a few chosen relations,\\r\\nnot by words, but by relations between the other words. \"socrates-plato\"\\r\\nmight be used to mean \"socrates precedes plato\"; \"plato-socrates\" might\\r\\nbe used to mean \"plato was born before socrates and died after him\"; and\\r\\nso on. but the possibilities of such a method would be very limited. for\\r\\naught i know, there may be languages that use it, but they are not among\\r\\nthe languages with which i am acquainted. and in any case, in view of\\r\\nthe multiplicity of relations that we wish to express, no language could\\r\\nadvance far without words for relations. but as soon as we have words\\r\\nfor relations, word-propositions have necessarily more terms than the\\r\\nfacts to which they refer, and cannot therefore correspond so simply\\r\\nwith their objectives as some image-propositions can.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe consideration of negative propositions and negative facts introduces\\r\\nfurther complications. an image-proposition is necessarily positive:\\r\\nwe can image the window to the left of the door, or to the right of the\\r\\ndoor, but we can form no image of the bare negative \"the window not to\\r\\nthe left of the door.\" we can disbelieve the image-proposition expressed\\r\\nby \"the window to the left of the door,\" and our disbelief will be true\\r\\nif the window is not to the left of the door. but we can form no image\\r\\nof the fact that the window is not to the left of the door. attempts\\r\\nhave often been made to deny such negative facts, but, for reasons which\\r\\ni have given elsewhere,* i believe these attempts to be mistaken, and i\\r\\nshall assume that there are negative facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"monist,\" january, 1919, p. 42 ff.\\r\\n\\r\\nword-propositions, like image-propositions, are always positive facts.\\r\\nthe fact that socrates precedes plato is symbolized in english by the\\r\\nfact that the word \"precedes\" occurs between the words \"socrates\" and\\r\\n\"plato.\" but we cannot symbolize the fact that plato does not precede\\r\\nsocrates by not putting the word \"precedes\" between \"plato\" and\\r\\n\"socrates.\" a negative fact is not sensible, and language, being\\r\\nintended for communication, has to be sensible. therefore we symbolize\\r\\nthe fact that plato does not precede socrates by putting the words \"does\\r\\nnot precede\" between \"plato\" and \"socrates.\" we thus obtain a series of\\r\\nwords which is just as positive a fact as the series \"socrates precedes\\r\\nplato.\" the propositions asserting negative facts are themselves\\r\\npositive facts; they are merely different positive facts from those\\r\\nasserting positive facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have thus, as regards the opposition of positive and negative, three\\r\\ndifferent sorts of duality, according as we are dealing with facts,\\r\\nimage-propositions, or word-propositions. we have, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) positive and negative facts;\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) image-propositions, which may be believed or disbelieved, but do\\r\\nnot allow any duality of content corresponding to positive and negative\\r\\nfacts;\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) word-propositions, which are always positive facts, but are of two\\r\\nkinds: one verified by a positive objective, the other by a negative\\r\\nobjective.\\r\\n\\r\\nowing to these complications, the simplest type of correspondence is\\r\\nimpossible when either negative facts or negative propositions are\\r\\ninvolved.\\r\\n\\r\\neven when we confine ourselves to relations between two terms which are\\r\\nboth imaged, it may be impossible to form an image-proposition in which\\r\\nthe relation of the terms is represented by the same relation of the\\r\\nimages. suppose we say \"caesar was 2,000 years before foch,\" we express\\r\\na certain temporal relation between caesar and foch; but we cannot allow\\r\\n2,000 years to elapse between our image of caesar and our image of foch.\\r\\nthis is perhaps not a fair example, since \"2,000 years before\" is not a\\r\\ndirect relation. but take a case where the relation is direct, say, \"the\\r\\nsun is brighter than the moon.\" we can form visual images of sunshine\\r\\nand moonshine, and it may happen that our image of the sunshine is\\r\\nthe brighter of the two, but this is by no means either necessary or\\r\\nsufficient. the act of comparison, implied in our judgment, is something\\r\\nmore than the mere coexistence of two images, one of which is in fact\\r\\nbrighter than the other. it would take us too far from our main topic if\\r\\nwe were to go into the question what actually occurs when we make this\\r\\njudgment. enough has been said to show that the correspondence between\\r\\nthe belief and its objective is more complicated in this case than in\\r\\nthat of the window to the left of the door, and this was all that had to\\r\\nbe proved.\\r\\n\\r\\nin spite of these complications, the general nature of the formal\\r\\ncorrespondence which makes truth is clear from our instances. in the\\r\\ncase of the simpler kind of propositions, namely those that i call\\r\\n\"atomic\" propositions, where there is only one word expressing a\\r\\nrelation, the objective which would verify our proposition, assuming\\r\\nthat the word \"not\" is absent, is obtained by replacing each word\\r\\nby what it means, the word meaning a relation being replaced by this\\r\\nrelation among the meanings of the other words. for example, if the\\r\\nproposition is \"socrates precedes plato,\" the objective which verifies\\r\\nit results from replacing the word \"socrates\" by socrates, the word\\r\\n\"plato\" by plato, and the word \"precedes\" by the relation of preceding\\r\\nbetween socrates and plato. if the result of this process is a fact,\\r\\nthe proposition is true; if not, it is false. when our proposition is\\r\\n\"socrates does not precede plato,\" the conditions of truth and falsehood\\r\\nare exactly reversed. more complicated propositions can be dealt with on\\r\\nthe same lines. in fact, the purely formal question, which has occupied\\r\\nus in this last section, offers no very formidable difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not believe that the above formal theory is untrue, but i do\\r\\nbelieve that it is inadequate. it does not, for example, throw any\\r\\nlight upon our preference for true beliefs rather than false ones. this\\r\\npreference is only explicable by taking account of the causal efficacy\\r\\nof beliefs, and of the greater appropriateness of the responses\\r\\nresulting from true beliefs. but appropriateness depends upon purpose,\\r\\nand purpose thus becomes a vital part of theory of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture xiv. emotions and will\\r\\n\\r\\non the two subjects of the present lecture i have nothing original to\\r\\nsay, and i am treating them only in order to complete the discussion of\\r\\nmy main thesis, namely that all psychic phenomena are built up out of\\r\\nsensations and images alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nemotions are traditionally regarded by psychologists as a separate\\r\\nclass of mental occurrences: i am, of course, not concerned to deny\\r\\nthe obvious fact that they have characteristics which make a special\\r\\ninvestigation of them necessary. what i am concerned with is the\\r\\nanalysis of emotions. it is clear that an emotion is essentially\\r\\ncomplex, and we have to inquire whether it ever contains any\\r\\nnon-physiological material not reducible to sensations and images and\\r\\ntheir relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nalthough what specially concerns us is the analysis of emotions, we\\r\\nshall find that the more important topic is the physiological causation\\r\\nof emotions. this is a subject upon which much valuable and exceedingly\\r\\ninteresting work has been done, whereas the bare analysis of emotions\\r\\nhas proved somewhat barren. in view of the fact that we have defined\\r\\nperceptions, sensations, and images by their physiological causation, it\\r\\nis evident that our problem of the analysis of the emotions is bound up\\r\\nwith the problem of their physiological causation.\\r\\n\\r\\nmodern views on the causation of emotions begin with what is called\\r\\nthe james-lange theory. james states this view in the following terms\\r\\n(\"psychology,\" vol. ii, p. 449):\\r\\n\\r\\n\"our natural way of thinking about these coarser emotions, grief, fear,\\r\\nrage, love, is that the mental perception of some fact excites the\\r\\nmental affection called the emotion, and that this latter state of mind\\r\\ngives rise to the bodily expression. my theory, on the contrary, is that\\r\\nthe bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact,\\r\\nand that our feeling of the same changes as they occur _is_ the emotion\\r\\n(james\\'s italics). common sense says: we lose our fortune, are sorry\\r\\nand weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by\\r\\na rival, are angry and strike. the hypothesis here to be defended says\\r\\nthat this order of sequence is incorrect, that the one mental state is\\r\\nnot immediately induced by the other, that the bodily manifestations\\r\\nmust first be interposed between, and that the more rational statement\\r\\nis that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid\\r\\nbecause we tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because\\r\\nwe are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be. without the bodily\\r\\nstates following on the perception, the latter would be purely cognitive\\r\\nin form, pale, colourless, destitute of emotional warmth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nround this hypothesis a very voluminous literature has grown up. the\\r\\nhistory of its victory over earlier criticism, and its difficulties with\\r\\nthe modern experimental work of sherrington and cannon, is well told\\r\\nby james r. angell in an article called \"a reconsideration of james\\'s\\r\\ntheory of emotion in the light of recent criticisms.\"* in this article\\r\\nangell defends james\\'s theory and to me--though i speak with diffidence\\r\\non a question as to which i have little competence--it appears that his\\r\\ndefence is on the whole successful.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"psychological review,\" 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nsherrington, by experiments on dogs, showed that many of the usual marks\\r\\nof emotion were present in their behaviour even when, by severing the\\r\\nspinal cord in the lower cervical region, the viscera were cut off from\\r\\nall communication with the brain, except that existing through certain\\r\\ncranial nerves. he mentions the various signs which \"contributed to\\r\\nindicate the existence of an emotion as lively as the animal had ever\\r\\nshown us before the spinal operation had been made.\"* he infers that\\r\\nthe physiological condition of the viscera cannot be the cause of the\\r\\nemotion displayed under such circumstances, and concludes: \"we are\\r\\nforced back toward the likelihood that the visceral expression of\\r\\nemotion is secondary to the cerebral action occurring with the psychical\\r\\nstate.... we may with james accept visceral and organic sensations\\r\\nand the memories and associations of them as contributory to primitive\\r\\nemotion, but we must regard them as re-enforcing rather than as\\r\\ninitiating the psychosis.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * quoted by angell, loc. cit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nangell suggests that the display of emotion in such cases may be due\\r\\nto past experience, generating habits which would require only the\\r\\nstimulation of cerebral reflex arcs. rage and some forms of fear,\\r\\nhowever, may, he thinks, gain expression without the brain. rage and\\r\\nfear have been especially studied by cannon, whose work is of the\\r\\ngreatest importance. his results are given in his book, \"bodily changes\\r\\nin pain, hunger, fear and rage\" (d. appleton and co., 1916).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe most interesting part of cannon\\'s book consists in the investigation\\r\\nof the effects produced by secretion of adrenin. adrenin is a substance\\r\\nsecreted into the blood by the adrenal glands. these are among the\\r\\nductless glands, the functions of which, both in physiology and in\\r\\nconnection with the emotions, have only come to be known during recent\\r\\nyears. cannon found that pain, fear and rage occurred in circumstances\\r\\nwhich affected the supply of adrenin, and that an artificial injection\\r\\nof adrenin could, for example, produce all the symptoms of fear. he\\r\\nstudied the effects of adrenin on various parts of the body; he found\\r\\nthat it causes the pupils to dilate, hairs to stand erect, blood vessels\\r\\nto be constricted, and so on. these effects were still produced if\\r\\nthe parts in question were removed from the body and kept alive\\r\\nartificially.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cannon\\'s work is not unconnected with that of mosso, who\\r\\n     maintains, as the result of much experimental work, that\\r\\n     \"the seat of the emotions lies in the sympathetic nervous\\r\\n     system.\" an account of the work of both these men will be\\r\\n     found in goddard\\'s \"psychology of the normal and sub-normal\"\\r\\n     (kegan paul, 1919), chap. vii and appendix.\\r\\n\\r\\ncannon\\'s chief argument against james is, if i understand him rightly,\\r\\nthat similar affections of the viscera may accompany dissimilar\\r\\nemotions, especially fear and rage. various different emotions make\\r\\nus cry, and therefore it cannot be true to say, as james does, that we\\r\\n\"feel sorry because we cry,\" since sometimes we cry when we feel glad.\\r\\nthis argument, however, is by no means conclusive against james, because\\r\\nit cannot be shown that there are no visceral differences for different\\r\\nemotions, and indeed it is unlikely that this is the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nas angell says (loc. cit.): \"fear and joy may both cause cardiac\\r\\npalpitation, but in one case we find high tonus of the skeletal muscles,\\r\\nin the other case relaxation and the general sense of weakness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nangell\\'s conclusion, after discussing the experiments of sherrington\\r\\nand cannon, is: \"i would therefore submit that, so far as concerns\\r\\nthe critical suggestions by these two psychologists, james\\'s essential\\r\\ncontentions are not materially affected.\" if it were necessary for me to\\r\\ntake sides on this question, i should agree with this conclusion; but i\\r\\nthink my thesis as to the analysis of emotion can be maintained without\\r\\ncoming to a probably premature conclusion upon the doubtful parts of\\r\\nthe physiological problem.\\r\\n\\r\\naccording to our definitions, if james is right, an emotion may be\\r\\nregarded as involving a confused perception of the viscera concerned\\r\\nin its causation, while if cannon and sherrington are right, an emotion\\r\\ninvolves a confused perception of its external stimulus. this follows\\r\\nfrom what was said in lecture vii. we there defined a perception as an\\r\\nappearance, however irregular, of one or more objects external to the\\r\\nbrain. and in order to be an appearance of one or more objects, it is\\r\\nonly necessary that the occurrence in question should be connected\\r\\nwith them by a continuous chain, and should vary when they are varied\\r\\nsufficiently. thus the question whether a mental occurrence can be\\r\\ncalled a perception turns upon the question whether anything can be\\r\\ninferred from it as to its causes outside the brain: if such inference\\r\\nis possible, the occurrence in question will come within our definition\\r\\nof a perception. and in that case, according to the definition in\\r\\nlecture viii, its non-mnemic elements will be sensations. accordingly,\\r\\nwhether emotions are caused by changes in the viscera or by sensible\\r\\nobjects, they contain elements which are sensations according to our\\r\\ndefinition.\\r\\n\\r\\nan emotion in its entirety is, of course, something much more complex\\r\\nthan a perception. an emotion is essentially a process, and it will be\\r\\nonly what one may call a cross-section of the emotion that will be a\\r\\nperception, of a bodily condition according to james, or (in certain\\r\\ncases) of an external object according to his opponents. an emotion in\\r\\nits entirety contains dynamic elements, such as motor impulses, desires,\\r\\npleasures and pains. desires and pleasures and pains, according to the\\r\\ntheory adopted in lecture iii, are characteristics of processes, not\\r\\nseparate ingredients. an emotion--rage, for example--will be a certain\\r\\nkind of process, consisting of perceptions and (in general) bodily\\r\\nmovements. the desires and pleasures and pains involved are properties\\r\\nof this process, not separate items in the stuff of which the emotion\\r\\nis composed. the dynamic elements in an emotion, if we are right in our\\r\\nanalysis, contain, from our point of view, no ingredients beyond those\\r\\ncontained in the processes considered in lecture iii. the ingredients\\r\\nof an emotion are only sensations and images and bodily movements\\r\\nsucceeding each other according to a certain pattern. with this\\r\\nconclusion we may leave the emotions and pass to the consideration of\\r\\nthe will.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to be defined when we are dealing with will is a\\r\\nvoluntary movement. we have already defined vital movements, and we have\\r\\nmaintained that, from a behaviourist standpoint, it is impossible to\\r\\ndistinguish which among such movements are reflex and which voluntary.\\r\\nnevertheless, there certainly is a distinction. when we decide in the\\r\\nmorning that it is time to get up, our consequent movement is voluntary.\\r\\nthe beating of the heart, on the other hand, is involuntary: we can\\r\\nneither cause it nor prevent it by any decision of our own, except\\r\\nindirectly, as e.g. by drugs. breathing is intermediate between the two:\\r\\nwe normally breathe without the help of the will, but we can alter or\\r\\nstop our breathing if we choose.\\r\\n\\r\\njames (\"psychology,\" chap. xxvi) maintains that the only distinctive\\r\\ncharacteristic of a voluntary act is that it involves an idea of the\\r\\nmovement to be performed, made up of memory-images of the kinaesthetic\\r\\nsensations which we had when the same movement occurred on some former\\r\\noccasion. he points out that, on this view, no movement can be made\\r\\nvoluntarily unless it has previously occurred involuntarily.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * \"psychology,\" vol. ii, pp. 492-3.\\r\\n\\r\\ni see no reason to doubt the correctness of this view. we shall say,\\r\\nthen, that movements which are accompanied by kinaesthetic sensations\\r\\ntend to be caused by the images of those sensations, and when so caused\\r\\nare called voluntary.\\r\\n\\r\\nvolition, in the emphatic sense, involves something more than\\r\\nvoluntary movement. the sort of case i am thinking of is decision after\\r\\ndeliberation. voluntary movements are a part of this, but not the whole.\\r\\nthere is, in addition to them, a judgment: \"this is what i shall\\r\\ndo\"; there is also a sensation of tension during doubt, followed by a\\r\\ndifferent sensation at the moment of deciding. i see no reason whatever\\r\\nto suppose that there is any specifically new ingredient; sensations and\\r\\nimages, with their relations and causal laws, yield all that seems to\\r\\nbe wanted for the analysis of the will, together with the fact that\\r\\nkinaesthetic images tend to cause the movements with which they are\\r\\nconnected. conflict of desires is of course essential in the causation\\r\\nof the emphatic kind of will: there will be for a time kinaesthetic\\r\\nimages of incompatible movements, followed by the exclusive image of\\r\\nthe movement which is said to be willed. thus will seems to add no new\\r\\nirreducible ingredient to the analysis of the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlecture xv. characteristics of mental phenomena\\r\\n\\r\\nat the end of our journey it is time to return to the question from\\r\\nwhich we set out, namely: what is it that characterizes mind as opposed\\r\\nto matter? or, to state the same question in other terms: how is\\r\\npsychology to be distinguished from physics? the answer provisionally\\r\\nsuggested at the outset of our inquiry was that psychology and physics\\r\\nare distinguished by the nature of their causal laws, not by their\\r\\nsubject matter. at the same time we held that there is a certain subject\\r\\nmatter, namely images, to which only psychological causal laws are\\r\\napplicable; this subject matter, therefore, we assigned exclusively to\\r\\npsychology. but we found no way of defining images except through\\r\\ntheir causation; in their intrinsic character they appeared to have no\\r\\nuniversal mark by which they could be distinguished from sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this last lecture i propose to pass in review various suggested\\r\\nmethods of distinguishing mind from matter. i shall then briefly sketch\\r\\nthe nature of that fundamental science which i believe to be the true\\r\\nmetaphysic, in which mind and matter alike are seen to be constructed\\r\\nout of a neutral stuff, whose causal laws have no such duality as that\\r\\nof psychology, but form the basis upon which both physics and psychology\\r\\nare built.\\r\\n\\r\\nin search for the definition of \"mental phenomena,\" let us begin with\\r\\n\"consciousness,\" which is often thought to be the essence of mind.\\r\\nin the first lecture i gave various arguments against the view that\\r\\nconsciousness is fundamental, but i did not attempt to say what\\r\\nconsciousness is. we must find a definition of it, if we are to feel\\r\\nsecure in deciding that it is not fundamental. it is for the sake of the\\r\\nproof that it is not fundamental that we must now endeavour to decide\\r\\nwhat it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"consciousness,\" by those who regard it as fundamental, is taken to be a\\r\\ncharacter diffused throughout our mental life, distinct from sensations\\r\\nand images, memories, beliefs and desires, but present in all of\\r\\nthem.* dr. henry head, in an article which i quoted in lecture iii,\\r\\ndistinguishing sensations from purely physiological occurrences, says:\\r\\n\"sensation, in the strict sense of the term, demands the existence of\\r\\nconsciousness.\" this statement, at first sight, is one to which we feel\\r\\ninclined to assent, but i believe we are mistaken if we do so. sensation\\r\\nis the sort of thing of which we may be conscious, but not a thing\\r\\nof which we must be conscious. we have been led, in the course of our\\r\\ninquiry, to admit unconscious beliefs and unconscious desires. there is,\\r\\nso far as i can see, no class of mental or other occurrences of which we\\r\\nare always conscious whenever they happen.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. lecture vi.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing to notice is that consciousness must be of something. in\\r\\nview of this, i should define \"consciousness\" in terms of that relation\\r\\nof an image of a word to an object which we defined, in lecture xi, as\\r\\n\"meaning.\" when a sensation is followed by an image which is a \"copy\" of\\r\\nit, i think it may be said that the existence of the image constitutes\\r\\nconsciousness of the sensation, provided it is accompanied by that sort\\r\\nof belief which, when we reflect upon it, makes us feel that the image\\r\\nis a \"sign\" of something other than itself. this is the sort of belief\\r\\nwhich, in the case of memory, we expressed in the words \"this occurred\";\\r\\nor which, in the case of a judgment of perception, makes us believe\\r\\nin qualities correlated with present sensations, as e.g., tactile and\\r\\nvisual qualities are correlated. the addition of some element of belief\\r\\nseems required, since mere imagination does not involve consciousness of\\r\\nanything, and there can be no consciousness which is not of something.\\r\\nif images alone constituted consciousness of their prototypes,\\r\\nsuch imagination-images as in fact have prototypes would involve\\r\\nconsciousness of them; since this is not the case, an element of belief\\r\\nmust be added to the images in defining consciousness. the belief must\\r\\nbe of that sort that constitutes objective reference, past or\\r\\npresent. an image, together with a belief of this sort concerning it,\\r\\nconstitutes, according to our definition, consciousness of the prototype\\r\\nof the image.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut when we pass from consciousness of sensations to consciousness of\\r\\nobjects of perception, certain further points arise which demand an\\r\\naddition to our definition. a judgment of perception, we may say,\\r\\nconsists of a core of sensation, together with associated images, with\\r\\nbelief in the present existence of an object to which sensation and\\r\\nimages are referred in a way which is difficult to analyse. perhaps we\\r\\nmight say that the belief is not fundamentally in any present existence,\\r\\nbut is of the nature of an expectation: for example, when we see an\\r\\nobject, we expect certain sensations to result if we proceed to touch\\r\\nit. perception, then, will consist of a present sensation together with\\r\\nexpectations of future sensations. (this, of course, is a reflective\\r\\nanalysis, not an account of the way perception appears to unchecked\\r\\nintrospection.) but all such expectations are liable to be erroneous,\\r\\nsince they are based upon correlations which are usual but not\\r\\ninvariable. any such correlation may mislead us in a particular case,\\r\\nfor example, if we try to touch a reflection in a looking-glass under\\r\\nthe impression that it is \"real.\" since memory is fallible, a similar\\r\\ndifficulty arises as regards consciousness of past objects. it would\\r\\nseem odd to say that we can be \"conscious\" of a thing which does not or\\r\\ndid not exist. the only way to avoid this awkwardness is to add to our\\r\\ndefinition the proviso that the beliefs involved in consciousness must\\r\\nbe true.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the second place, the question arises as to whether we can be\\r\\nconscious of images. if we apply our definition to this case, it seems\\r\\nto demand images of images. in order, for example, to be conscious of\\r\\nan image of a cat, we shall require, according to the letter of the\\r\\ndefinition, an image which is a copy of our image of the cat, and has\\r\\nthis image for its prototype. now, it hardly seems probable, as a matter\\r\\nof observation, that there are images of images, as opposed to images\\r\\nof sensations. we may meet this difficulty in two ways, either by boldly\\r\\ndenying consciousness of images, or by finding a sense in which, by\\r\\nmeans of a different accompanying belief, an image, instead of meaning\\r\\nits prototype, can mean another image of the same prototype.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first alternative, which denies consciousness of images, has already\\r\\nbeen discussed when we were dealing with introspection in lecture vi. we\\r\\nthen decided that there must be, in some sense, consciousness of images.\\r\\nwe are therefore left with the second suggested way of dealing with\\r\\nknowledge of images. according to this second hypothesis, there may be\\r\\ntwo images of the same prototype, such that one of them means the other,\\r\\ninstead of meaning the prototype. it will be remembered that we defined\\r\\nmeaning by association a word or image means an object, we said, when it\\r\\nhas the same associations as the object. but this definition must not be\\r\\ninterpreted too absolutely: a word or image will not have all the\\r\\nsame associations as the object which it means. the word \"cat\" may\\r\\nbe associated with the word \"mat,\" but it would not happen except by\\r\\naccident that a cat would be associated with a mat. and in like manner\\r\\nan image may have certain associations which its prototype will not\\r\\nhave, e.g. an association with the word \"image.\" when these associations\\r\\nare active, an image means an image, instead of meaning its prototype.\\r\\nif i have had images of a given prototype many times, i can mean one of\\r\\nthese, as opposed to the rest, by recollecting the time and place or any\\r\\nother distinctive association of that one occasion. this happens, for\\r\\nexample, when a place recalls to us some thought we previously had in\\r\\nthat place, so that we remember a thought as opposed to the occurrence\\r\\nto which it referred. thus we may say that we think of an image a when\\r\\nwe have a similar image b associated with recollections of circumstances\\r\\nconnected with a, but not with its prototype or with other images of the\\r\\nsame prototype. in this way we become aware of images without the\\r\\nneed of any new store of mental contents, merely by the help of new\\r\\nassociations. this theory, so far as i can see, solves the problems of\\r\\nintrospective knowledge, without requiring heroic measures such as those\\r\\nproposed by knight dunlap, whose views we discussed in lecture vi.\\r\\n\\r\\naccording to what we have been saying, sensation itself is not an\\r\\ninstance of consciousness, though the immediate memory by which it is\\r\\napt to be succeeded is so. a sensation which is remembered becomes an\\r\\nobject of consciousness as soon as it begins to be remembered, which\\r\\nwill normally be almost immediately after its occurrence (if at all);\\r\\nbut while it exists it is not an object of consciousness. if, however,\\r\\nit is part of a perception, say of some familiar person, we may say that\\r\\nthe person perceived is an object of consciousness. for in this case\\r\\nthe sensation is a sign of the perceived object in much the same way\\r\\nin which a memory-image is a sign of a remembered object. the essential\\r\\npractical function of \"consciousness\" and \"thought\" is that they enable\\r\\nus to act with reference to what is distant in time or space, even\\r\\nthough it is not at present stimulating our senses. this reference\\r\\nto absent objects is possible through association and habit. actual\\r\\nsensations, in themselves, are not cases of consciousness, because they\\r\\ndo not bring in this reference to what is absent. but their connection\\r\\nwith consciousness is very close, both through immediate memory, and\\r\\nthrough the correlations which turn sensations into perceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nenough has, i hope, been said to show that consciousness is far too\\r\\ncomplex and accidental to be taken as the fundamental characteristic\\r\\nof mind. we have seen that belief and images both enter into it. belief\\r\\nitself, as we saw in an earlier lecture, is complex. therefore, if any\\r\\ndefinition of mind is suggested by our analysis of consciousness, images\\r\\nare what would naturally suggest themselves. but since we found\\r\\nthat images can only be defined causally, we cannot deal with this\\r\\nsuggestion, except in connection with the difference between physical\\r\\nand psychological causal laws.\\r\\n\\r\\ni come next to those characteristics of mental phenomena which arise out\\r\\nof mnemic causation. the possibility of action with reference to what\\r\\nis not sensibly present is one of the things that might be held to\\r\\ncharacterize mind. let us take first a very elementary example. suppose\\r\\nyou are in a familiar room at night, and suddenly the light goes out.\\r\\nyou will be able to find your way to the door without much difficulty\\r\\nby means of the picture of the room which you have in your mind. in this\\r\\ncase visual images serve, somewhat imperfectly it is true, the purpose\\r\\nwhich visual sensations would otherwise serve. the stimulus to the\\r\\nproduction of visual images is the desire to get out of the room, which,\\r\\naccording to what we found in lecture iii, consists essentially of\\r\\npresent sensations and motor impulses caused by them. again, words heard\\r\\nor read enable you to act with reference to the matters about which they\\r\\ngive information; here, again, a present sensible stimulus, in virtue of\\r\\nhabits formed in the past, enables you to act in a manner appropriate\\r\\nto an object which is not sensibly present. the whole essence of the\\r\\npractical efficiency of \"thought\" consists in sensitiveness to signs:\\r\\nthe sensible presence of a, which is a sign of the present or future\\r\\nexistence of b, enables us to act in a manner appropriate to b. of\\r\\nthis, words are the supreme example, since their effects as signs are\\r\\nprodigious, while their intrinsic interest as sensible occurrences on\\r\\ntheir own account is usually very slight. the operation of signs may or\\r\\nmay not be accompanied by consciousness. if a sensible stimulus a calls\\r\\nup an image of b, and we then act with reference to b, we have what may\\r\\nbe called consciousness of b. but habit may enable us to act in a manner\\r\\nappropriate to b as soon as a appears, without ever having an image of\\r\\nb. in that case, although a operates as a sign, it operates without the\\r\\nhelp of consciousness. broadly speaking, a very familiar sign tends to\\r\\noperate directly in this manner, and the intervention of consciousness\\r\\nmarks an imperfectly established habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe power of acquiring experience, which characterizes men and animals,\\r\\nis an example of the general law that, in mnemic causation, the causal\\r\\nunit is not one event at one time, but two or more events at two or more\\r\\ntimes.& a burnt child fears the fire, that is to say, the neighbourhood\\r\\nof fire has a different effect upon a child which has had the sensations\\r\\nof burning than upon one which has not. more correctly, the observed\\r\\neffect, when a child which has been burnt is put near a fire, has for\\r\\nits cause, not merely the neighbourhood of the fire, but this together\\r\\nwith the previous burning. the general formula, when an animal has\\r\\nacquired experience through some event a, is that, when b occurs at some\\r\\nfuture time, the animal to which a has happened acts differently from\\r\\nan animal which a has not happened. thus a and b together, not either\\r\\nseparately, must be regarded as the cause of the animal\\'s behaviour,\\r\\nunless we take account of the effect which a has had in altering the\\r\\nanimal\\'s nervous tissue, which is a matter not patent to external\\r\\nobservation except under very special circumstances. with this\\r\\npossibility, we are brought back to causal laws, and to the suggestion\\r\\nthat many things which seem essentially mental are really neural.\\r\\nperhaps it is the nerves that acquire experience rather than the mind.\\r\\nif so, the possibility of acquiring experience cannot be used to define\\r\\nmind.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * cf. lecture iv.\\r\\n\\r\\nvery similar considerations apply to memory, if taken as the essence of\\r\\nmind. a recollection is aroused by something which is happening now,\\r\\nbut is different from the effect which the present occurrence would\\r\\nhave produced if the recollected event had not occurred. this may be\\r\\naccounted for by the physical effect of the past event on the brain,\\r\\nmaking it a different instrument from that which would have resulted\\r\\nfrom a different experience. the causal peculiarities of memory may,\\r\\ntherefore, have a physiological explanation. with every special class of\\r\\nmental phenomena this possibility meets us afresh. if psychology is\\r\\nto be a separate science at all, we must seek a wider ground for its\\r\\nseparateness than any that we have been considering hitherto.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have found that \"consciousness\" is too narrow to characterize mental\\r\\nphenomena, and that mnemic causation is too wide. i come now to a\\r\\ncharacteristic which, though difficult to define, comes much nearer to\\r\\nwhat we require, namely subjectivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nsubjectivity, as a characteristic of mental phenomena, was considered in\\r\\nlecture vii, in connection with the definition of perception. we there\\r\\ndecided that those particulars which constitute the physical world can\\r\\nbe collected into sets in two ways, one of which makes a bundle of all\\r\\nthose particulars that are appearances of a given thing from different\\r\\nplaces, while the other makes a bundle of all those particulars which\\r\\nare appearances of different things from a given place. a bundle of\\r\\nthis latter sort, at a given time, is called a \"perspective\"; taken\\r\\nthroughout a period of time, it is called a \"biography.\" subjectivity is\\r\\nthe characteristic of perspectives and biographies, the characteristic\\r\\nof giving the view of the world from a certain place. we saw in lecture\\r\\nvii that this characteristic involves none of the other characteristics\\r\\nthat are commonly associated with mental phenomena, such as\\r\\nconsciousness, experience and memory. we found in fact that it is\\r\\nexhibited by a photographic plate, and, strictly speaking, by any\\r\\nparticular taken in conjunction with those which have the same \"passive\"\\r\\nplace in the sense defined in lecture vii. the particulars forming one\\r\\nperspective are connected together primarily by simultaneity;\\r\\nthose forming one biography, primarily by the existence of direct\\r\\ntime-relations between them. to these are to be added relations\\r\\nderivable from the laws of perspective. in all this we are clearly not\\r\\nin the region of psychology, as commonly understood; yet we are also\\r\\nhardly in the region of physics. and the definition of perspectives\\r\\nand biographies, though it does not yet yield anything that would\\r\\nbe commonly called \"mental,\" is presupposed in mental phenomena, for\\r\\nexample in mnemic causation: the causal unit in mnemic causation, which\\r\\ngives rise to semon\\'s engram, is the whole of one perspective--not of\\r\\nany perspective, but of a perspective in a place where there is nervous\\r\\ntissue, or at any rate living tissue of some sort. perception also,\\r\\nas we saw, can only be defined in terms of perspectives. thus the\\r\\nconception of subjectivity, i.e. of the \"passive\" place of a particular,\\r\\nthough not alone sufficient to define mind, is clearly an essential\\r\\nelement in the definition.\\r\\n\\r\\ni have maintained throughout these lectures that the data of psychology\\r\\ndo not differ in, their intrinsic character from the data of physics.\\r\\ni have maintained that sensations are data for psychology and\\r\\nphysics equally, while images, which may be in some sense exclusively\\r\\npsychological data, can only be distinguished from sensations by their\\r\\ncorrelations, not by what they are in themselves. it is now necessary,\\r\\nhowever, to examine the notion of a \"datum,\" and to obtain, if possible,\\r\\na definition of this notion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe notion of \"data\" is familiar throughout science, and is usually\\r\\ntreated by men of science as though it were perfectly clear.\\r\\npsychologists, on the other hand, find great difficulty in the\\r\\nconception. \"data\" are naturally defined in terms of theory of\\r\\nknowledge: they are those propositions of which the truth is known\\r\\nwithout demonstration, so that they may be used as premisses in proving\\r\\nother propositions. further, when a proposition which is a datum asserts\\r\\nthe existence of something, we say that the something is a datum, as\\r\\nwell as the proposition asserting its existence. thus those objects\\r\\nof whose existence we become certain through perception are said to be\\r\\ndata.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is some difficulty in connecting this epistemological definition\\r\\nof \"data\" with our psychological analysis of knowledge; but until such\\r\\na connection has been effected, we have no right to use the conception\\r\\n\"data.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nit is clear, in the first place, that there can be no datum apart from a\\r\\nbelief. a sensation which merely comes and goes is not a datum; it only\\r\\nbecomes a datum when it is remembered. similarly, in perception, we do\\r\\nnot have a datum unless we have a judgment of perception. in the sense\\r\\nin which objects (as opposed to propositions) are data, it would seem\\r\\nnatural to say that those objects of which we are conscious are data.\\r\\nbut consciousness, as we have seen, is a complex notion, involving\\r\\nbeliefs, as well as mnemic phenomena such as are required for perception\\r\\nand memory. it follows that no datum is theoretically indubitable, since\\r\\nno belief is infallible; it follows also that every datum has a greater\\r\\nor less degree of vagueness, since there is always some vagueness in\\r\\nmemory and the meaning of images.\\r\\n\\r\\ndata are not those things of which our consciousness is earliest in\\r\\ntime. at every period of life, after we have become capable of thought,\\r\\nsome of our beliefs are obtained by inference, while others are not.\\r\\na belief may pass from either of these classes into the other, and may\\r\\ntherefore become, or cease to be, a belief giving a datum. when, in what\\r\\nfollows, i speak of data, i do not mean the things of which we feel sure\\r\\nbefore scientific study begins, but the things which, when a science\\r\\nis well advanced, appear as affording grounds for other parts of\\r\\nthe science, without themselves being believed on any ground except\\r\\nobservation. i assume, that is to say, a trained observer, with an\\r\\nanalytic attention, knowing the sort of thing to look for, and the sort\\r\\nof thing that will be important. what he observes is, at the stage of\\r\\nscience which he has reached, a datum for his science. it is just as\\r\\nsophisticated and elaborate as the theories which he bases upon it,\\r\\nsince only trained habits and much practice enable a man to make\\r\\nthe kind of observation that will be scientifically illuminating.\\r\\nnevertheless, when once it has been observed, belief in it is not based\\r\\non inference and reasoning, but merely upon its having been seen. in\\r\\nthis way its logical status differs from that of the theories which are\\r\\nproved by its means.\\r\\n\\r\\nin any science other than psychology the datum is primarily a\\r\\nperception, in which only the sensational core is ultimately and\\r\\ntheoretically a datum, though some such accretions as turn the sensation\\r\\ninto a perception are practically unavoidable. but if we postulate an\\r\\nideal observer, he will be able to isolate the sensation, and treat this\\r\\nalone as datum. there is, therefore, an important sense in which we\\r\\nmay say that, if we analyse as much as we ought, our data, outside\\r\\npsychology, consist of sensations, which include within themselves\\r\\ncertain spatial and temporal relations.\\r\\n\\r\\napplying this remark to physiology, we see that the nerves and brain\\r\\nas physical objects are not truly data; they are to be replaced, in\\r\\nthe ideal structure of science, by the sensations through which the\\r\\nphysiologist is said to perceive them. the passage from these sensations\\r\\nto nerves and brain as physical objects belongs really to the initial\\r\\nstage in the theory of physics, and ought to be placed in the reasoned\\r\\npart, not in the part supposed to be observed. to say we see the\\r\\nnerves is like saying we hear the nightingale; both are convenient but\\r\\ninaccurate expressions. we hear a sound which we believe to be causally\\r\\nconnected with the nightingale, and we see a sight which we believe\\r\\nto be causally connected with a nerve. but in each case it is only\\r\\nthe sensation that ought, in strictness, to be called a datum. now,\\r\\nsensations are certainly among the data of psychology. therefore all the\\r\\ndata of the physical sciences are also psychological data. it remains\\r\\nto inquire whether all the data of psychology are also data of physical\\r\\nscience, and especially of physiology.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we have been right in our analysis of mind, the ultimate data of\\r\\npsychology are only sensations and images and their relations. beliefs,\\r\\ndesires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex phenomena\\r\\nconsisting of sensations and images variously interrelated. thus (apart\\r\\nfrom certain relations) the occurrences which seem most distinctively\\r\\nmental, and furthest removed from physics, are, like physical objects,\\r\\nconstructed or inferred, not part of the original stock of data in the\\r\\nperfected science. from both ends, therefore, the difference between\\r\\nphysical and psychological data is diminished. is there ultimately\\r\\nno difference, or do images remain as irreducibly and exclusively\\r\\npsychological? in view of the causal definition of the difference\\r\\nbetween images and sensations, this brings us to a new question, namely:\\r\\nare the causal laws of psychology different from those of any other\\r\\nscience, or are they really physiological?\\r\\n\\r\\ncertain ambiguities must be removed before this question can be\\r\\nadequately discussed.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, there is the distinction between rough approximate laws and\\r\\nsuch as appear to be precise and general. i shall return to the former\\r\\npresently; it is the latter that i wish to discuss now.\\r\\n\\r\\nmatter, as defined at the end of lecture v, is a logical fiction,\\r\\ninvented because it gives a convenient way of stating causal laws.\\r\\nexcept in cases of perfect regularity in appearances (of which we can\\r\\nhave no experience), the actual appearances of a piece of matter are not\\r\\nmembers of that ideal system of regular appearances which is defined\\r\\nas being the matter in question. but the matter is, after all, inferred\\r\\nfrom its appearances, which are used to verify physical laws. thus, in\\r\\nso far as physics is an empirical and verifiable science, it must assume\\r\\nor prove that the inference from appearances to matter is, in general,\\r\\nlegitimate, and it must be able to tell us, more or less, what\\r\\nappearances to expect. it is through this question of verifiability and\\r\\nempirical applicability to experience that we are led to a theory of\\r\\nmatter such as i advocate. from the consideration of this question it\\r\\nresults that physics, in so far as it is an empirical science, not a\\r\\nlogical phantasy, is concerned with particulars of just the same sort\\r\\nas those which psychology considers under the name of sensations. the\\r\\ncausal laws of physics, so interpreted, differ from those of psychology\\r\\nonly by the fact that they connect a particular with other appearances\\r\\nin the same piece of matter, rather than with other appearances in the\\r\\nsame perspective. that is to say, they group together particulars having\\r\\nthe same \"active\" place, while psychology groups together those having\\r\\nthe same \"passive\" place. some particulars, such as images, have no\\r\\n\"active\" place, and therefore belong exclusively to psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can now understand the distinction between physics and psychology.\\r\\nthe nerves and brain are matter: our visual sensations when we look\\r\\nat them may be, and i think are, members of the system constituting\\r\\nirregular appearances of this matter, but are not the whole of the\\r\\nsystem. psychology is concerned, inter alia, with our sensations when we\\r\\nsee a piece of matter, as opposed to the matter which we see. assuming,\\r\\nas we must, that our sensations have physical causes, their causal laws\\r\\nare nevertheless radically different from the laws of physics, since\\r\\nthe consideration of a single sensation requires the breaking up of\\r\\nthe group of which it is a member. when a sensation is used to verify\\r\\nphysics, it is used merely as a sign of a certain material phenomenon,\\r\\ni.e. of a group of particulars of which it is a member. but when it is\\r\\nstudied by psychology, it is taken away from that group and put\\r\\ninto quite a different context, where it causes images or voluntary\\r\\nmovements. it is primarily this different grouping that is\\r\\ncharacteristic of psychology as opposed to all the physical sciences,\\r\\nincluding physiology; a secondary difference is that images, which\\r\\nbelong to psychology, are not easily to be included among the aspects\\r\\nwhich constitute a physical thing or piece of matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere remains, however, an important question, namely: are mental events\\r\\ncausally dependent upon physical events in a sense in which the converse\\r\\ndependence does not hold? before we can discuss the answer to this\\r\\nquestion, we must first be clear as to what our question means.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen, given a, it is possible to infer b, but given b, it is not\\r\\npossible to infer a, we say that b is dependent upon a in a sense in\\r\\nwhich a is not dependent upon b. stated in logical terms, this amounts\\r\\nto saying that, when we know a many-one relation of a to b, b is\\r\\ndependent upon a in respect of this relation. if the relation is a\\r\\ncausal law, we say that b is causally dependent upon a. the illustration\\r\\nthat chiefly concerns us is the system of appearances of a physical\\r\\nobject. we can, broadly speaking, infer distant appearances from near\\r\\nones, but not vice versa. all men look alike when they are a mile away,\\r\\nhence when we see a man a mile off we cannot tell what he will look like\\r\\nwhen he is only a yard away. but when we see him a yard away, we can\\r\\ntell what he will look like a mile away. thus the nearer view gives us\\r\\nmore valuable information, and the distant view is causally dependent\\r\\nupon it in a sense in which it is not causally dependent upon the\\r\\ndistant view.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is this greater causal potency of the near appearance that leads\\r\\nphysics to state its causal laws in terms of that system of regular\\r\\nappearances to which the nearest appearances increasingly approximate,\\r\\nand that makes it value information derived from the microscope or\\r\\ntelescope. it is clear that our sensations, considered as irregular\\r\\nappearances of physical objects, share the causal dependence belonging\\r\\nto comparatively distant appearances; therefore in our sensational life\\r\\nwe are in causal dependence upon physical laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis, however, is not the most important or interesting part of our\\r\\nquestion. it is the causation of images that is the vital problem. we\\r\\nhave seen that they are subject to mnenic causation, and that mnenic\\r\\ncausation may be reducible to ordinary physical causation in nervous\\r\\ntissue. this is the question upon which our attitude must turn towards\\r\\nwhat may be called materialism. one sense of materialism is the view\\r\\nthat all mental phenomena are causally dependent upon physical phenomena\\r\\nin the above-defined sense of causal dependence. whether this is the\\r\\ncase or not, i do not profess to know. the question seems to me the\\r\\nsame as the question whether mnemic causation is ultimate, which we\\r\\nconsidered without deciding in lecture iv. but i think the bulk of the\\r\\nevidence points to the materialistic answer as the more probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nin considering the causal laws of psychology, the distinction between\\r\\nrough generalizations and exact laws is important. there are many rough\\r\\ngeneralizations in psychology, not only of the sort by which we\\r\\ngovern our ordinary behaviour to each other, but also of a more nearly\\r\\nscientific kind. habit and association belong among such laws. i will\\r\\ngive an illustration of the kind of law that can be obtained. suppose a\\r\\nperson has frequently experienced a and b in close temporal contiguity,\\r\\nan association will be established, so that a, or an image of a, tends\\r\\nto cause an image of b. the question arises: will the association work\\r\\nin either direction, or only from the one which has occurred earlier\\r\\nto the one which has occurred later? in an article by mr. wohlgemuth,\\r\\ncalled \"the direction of associations\" (\"british journal of psychology,\"\\r\\nvol. v, part iv, march, 1913), it is claimed to be proved by experiment\\r\\nthat, in so far as motor memory (i.e. memory of movements) is concerned,\\r\\nassociation works only from earlier to later, while in visual and\\r\\nauditory memory this is not the case, but the later of two neighbouring\\r\\nexperiences may recall the earlier as well as the earlier the later.\\r\\nit is suggested that motor memory is physiological, while visual and\\r\\nauditory memory are more truly psychological. but that is not the point\\r\\nwhich concerns us in the illustration. the point which concerns us\\r\\nis that a law of association, established by purely psychological\\r\\nobservation, is a purely psychological law, and may serve as a sample\\r\\nof what is possible in the way of discovering such laws. it is, however,\\r\\nstill no more than a rough generalization, a statistical average. it\\r\\ncannot tell us what will result from a given cause on a given occasion.\\r\\nit is a law of tendency, not a precise and invariable law such as those\\r\\nof physics aim at being.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we wish to pass from the law of habit, stated as a tendency or\\r\\naverage, to something more precise and invariable, we seem driven to the\\r\\nnervous system. we can more or less guess how an occurrence produces a\\r\\nchange in the brain, and how its repetition gradually produces something\\r\\nanalogous to the channel of a river, along which currents flow more\\r\\neasily than in neighbouring paths. we can perceive that in this way, if\\r\\nwe had more knowledge, the tendency to habit through repetition might\\r\\nbe replaced by a precise account of the effect of each occurrence\\r\\nin bringing about a modification of the sort from which habit would\\r\\nultimately result. it is such considerations that make students of\\r\\npsychophysiology materialistic in their methods, whatever they may be in\\r\\ntheir metaphysics. there are, of course, exceptions, such as professor\\r\\nj. s. haldane,* who maintains that it is theoretically impossible to\\r\\nobtain physiological explanations of psychical phenomena, or physical\\r\\nexplanations of physiological phenomena. but i think the bulk of expert\\r\\nopinion, in practice, is on the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\n     *see his book, \"the new physiology and other addresses\"\\r\\n     (charles griffin & co., 1919).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question whether it is possible to obtain precise causal laws in\\r\\nwhich the causes are psychological, not material, is one of detailed\\r\\ninvestigation. i have done what i could to make clear the nature of the\\r\\nquestion, but i do not believe that it is possible as yet to answer it\\r\\nwith any confidence. it seems to be by no means an insoluble question,\\r\\nand we may hope that science will be able to produce sufficient grounds\\r\\nfor regarding one answer as much more probable than the other. but for\\r\\nthe moment i do not see how we can come to a decision.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think, however, on grounds of the theory of matter explained in\\r\\nlectures v and vii, that an ultimate scientific account of what goes on\\r\\nin the world, if it were ascertainable, would resemble psychology rather\\r\\nthan physics in what we found to be the decisive difference between\\r\\nthem. i think, that is to say, that such an account would not be content\\r\\nto speak, even formally, as though matter, which is a logical fiction,\\r\\nwere the ultimate reality. i think that, if our scientific knowledge\\r\\nwere adequate to the task, which it neither is nor is likely to become,\\r\\nit would exhibit the laws of correlation of the particulars constituting\\r\\na momentary condition of a material unit, and would state the causal\\r\\nlaws* of the world in terms of these particulars, not in terms of\\r\\nmatter. causal laws so stated would, i believe, be applicable to\\r\\npsychology and physics equally; the science in which they were stated\\r\\nwould succeed in achieving what metaphysics has vainly attempted, namely\\r\\na unified account of what really happens, wholly true even if not the\\r\\nwhole of truth, and free from all convenient fictions or unwarrantable\\r\\nassumptions of metaphysical entities. a causal law applicable to\\r\\nparticulars would count as a law of physics if it could be stated in\\r\\nterms of those fictitious systems of regular appearances which are\\r\\nmatter; if this were not the case, it would count as a law of psychology\\r\\nif one of the particulars were a sensation or an image, i.e. were\\r\\nsubject to mnemic causation. i believe that the realization of the\\r\\ncomplexity of a material unit, and its analysis into constituents\\r\\nanalogous to sensations, is of the utmost importance to philosophy, and\\r\\nvital for any understanding of the relations between mind and matter,\\r\\nbetween our perceptions and the world which they perceive. it is in this\\r\\ndirection, i am convinced, that we must look for the solution of many\\r\\nancient perplexities.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * in a perfected science, causal laws will take the form of\\r\\n     differential equations--or of finite-difference equations,\\r\\n     if the theory of quanta should prove correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is probable that the whole science of mental occurrences, especially\\r\\nwhere its initial definitions are concerned, could be simplified by the\\r\\ndevelopment of the fundamental unifying science in which the causal laws\\r\\nof particulars are sought, rather than the causal laws of those systems\\r\\nof particulars that constitute the material units of physics. this\\r\\nfundamental science would cause physics to become derivative, in the\\r\\nsort of way in which theories of the constitution of the atom make\\r\\nchemistry derivative from physics; it would also cause psychology to\\r\\nappear less singular and isolated among sciences. if we are right in\\r\\nthis, it is a wrong philosophy of matter which has caused many of the\\r\\ndifficulties in the philosophy of mind--difficulties which a right\\r\\nphilosophy of matter would cause to disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe conclusions at which we have arrived may be summed up as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\ni. physics and psychology are not distinguished by their material. mind\\r\\nand matter alike are logical constructions; the particulars out of which\\r\\nthey are constructed, or from which they are inferred, have various\\r\\nrelations, some of which are studied by physics, others by psychology.\\r\\nbroadly speaking, physics group particulars by their active places,\\r\\npsychology by their passive places.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. the two most essential characteristics of the causal laws which\\r\\nwould naturally be called psychological are subjectivity and mnemic\\r\\ncausation; these are not unconnected, since the causal unit in mnemic\\r\\ncausation is the group of particulars having a given passive place at\\r\\na given time, and it is by this manner of grouping that subjectivity is\\r\\ndefined.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. habit, memory and thought are all developments of mnemic causation.\\r\\nit is probable, though not certain, that mnemic causation is derivative\\r\\nfrom ordinary physical causation in nervous (and other) tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\niv. consciousness is a complex and far from universal characteristic of\\r\\nmental phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nv. mind is a matter of degree, chiefly exemplified in number and\\r\\ncomplexity of habits.\\r\\n\\r\\nvi. all our data, both in physics and psychology, are subject to\\r\\npsychological causal laws; but physical causal laws, at least in\\r\\ntraditional physics, can only be stated in terms of matter, which is\\r\\nboth inferred and constructed, never a datum. in this respect psychology\\r\\nis nearer to what actually exists.the problems of philosophy\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nby bertrand russell\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\npreface\\r\\n\\r\\nin the following pages i have confined myself in the main to those\\r\\nproblems of philosophy in regard to which i thought it possible to say\\r\\nsomething positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism\\r\\nseemed out of place. for this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a\\r\\nlarger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics\\r\\nmuch discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.\\r\\n\\r\\ni have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of g. e.\\r\\nmoore and j. m. keynes: from the former, as regards the relations\\r\\nof sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards\\r\\nprobability and induction. i have also profited greatly by the\\r\\ncriticisms and suggestions of professor gilbert murray.\\r\\n\\r\\n1912\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter i. appearance and reality\\r\\n\\r\\nis there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no\\r\\nreasonable man could doubt it? this question, which at first sight might\\r\\nnot seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can\\r\\nbe asked. when we have realized the obstacles in the way of a\\r\\nstraightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the\\r\\nstudy of philosophy--for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer\\r\\nsuch ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in\\r\\nordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring\\r\\nall that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the\\r\\nvagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nin daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer\\r\\nscrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a\\r\\ngreat amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may\\r\\nbelieve. in the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our\\r\\npresent experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be\\r\\nderived from them. but any statement as to what it is that our immediate\\r\\nexperiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. it seems to me that\\r\\ni am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which i\\r\\nsee sheets of paper with writing or print. by turning my head i see out\\r\\nof the window buildings and clouds and the sun. i believe that the sun\\r\\nis about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot\\r\\nglobe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth\\'s\\r\\nrotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an\\r\\nindefinite time in the future. i believe that, if any other normal\\r\\nperson comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and\\r\\nbooks and papers as i see, and that the table which i see is the same as\\r\\nthe table which i feel pressing against my arm. all this seems to be\\r\\nso evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who\\r\\ndoubts whether i know anything. yet all this may be reasonably doubted,\\r\\nand all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure\\r\\nthat we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.\\r\\n\\r\\nto make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the\\r\\ntable. to the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is\\r\\nsmooth and cool and hard; when i tap it, it gives out a wooden sound.\\r\\nany one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this\\r\\ndescription, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise;\\r\\nbut as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. although\\r\\ni believe that the table is \\'really\\' of the same colour all over, the\\r\\nparts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts,\\r\\nand some parts look white because of reflected light. i know that, if\\r\\ni move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the\\r\\napparent distribution of colours on the table will change. it follows\\r\\nthat if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no\\r\\ntwo of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because\\r\\nno two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in\\r\\nthe point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to\\r\\nthe painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit\\r\\nof thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says\\r\\nthey \\'really\\' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they\\r\\nappear. here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions\\r\\nthat cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between\\r\\n\\'appearance\\' and \\'reality\\', between what things seem to be and what they\\r\\nare. the painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man\\r\\nand the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher\\'s\\r\\nwish to know this is stronger than the practical man\\'s, and is more\\r\\ntroubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nto return to the table. it is evident from what we have found, that\\r\\nthere is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the\\r\\ntable, or even of any one particular part of the table--it appears to\\r\\nbe of different colours from different points of view, and there is\\r\\nno reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than\\r\\nothers. and we know that even from a given point of view the colour will\\r\\nseem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a\\r\\nman wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour\\r\\nat all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. this\\r\\ncolour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something\\r\\ndepending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls\\r\\non the table. when, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the\\r\\ntable, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a\\r\\nnormal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions\\r\\nof light. but the other colours which appear under other conditions\\r\\nhave just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid\\r\\nfavouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any\\r\\none particular colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same thing applies to the texture. with the naked eye one can see\\r\\nthe grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. if we looked\\r\\nat it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and\\r\\nvalleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the\\r\\nnaked eye. which of these is the \\'real\\' table? we are naturally tempted\\r\\nto say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in\\r\\nturn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. if, then, we\\r\\ncannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we\\r\\nsee through a microscope? thus, again, the confidence in our senses with\\r\\nwhich we began deserts us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe shape of the table is no better. we are all in the habit of judging\\r\\nas to the \\'real\\' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that\\r\\nwe come to think we actually see the real shapes. but, in fact, as we\\r\\nall have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different\\r\\nin shape from every different point of view. if our table is \\'really\\'\\r\\nrectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had\\r\\ntwo acute angles and two obtuse angles. if opposite sides are parallel,\\r\\nthey will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator;\\r\\nif they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were\\r\\nlonger. all these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table,\\r\\nbecause experience has taught us to construct the \\'real\\' shape from the\\r\\napparent shape, and the \\'real\\' shape is what interests us as practical\\r\\nmen. but the \\'real\\' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred\\r\\nfrom what we see. and what we see is constantly changing in shape as we\\r\\nmove about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us\\r\\nthe truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\nsimilar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. it is\\r\\ntrue that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel\\r\\nthat it resists pressure. but the sensation we obtain depends upon how\\r\\nhard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press\\r\\nwith; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various\\r\\nparts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite\\r\\nproperty of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which\\r\\nperhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any\\r\\nof them. and the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which\\r\\ncan be elicited by rapping the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the\\r\\nsame as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. the\\r\\nreal table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all,\\r\\nbut must be an inference from what is immediately known. hence, two very\\r\\ndifficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) is there a real table at\\r\\nall? (2) if so, what sort of object can it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nit will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple\\r\\nterms of which the meaning is definite and clear. let us give the name\\r\\nof \\'sense-data\\' to the things that are immediately known in sensation:\\r\\nsuch things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and\\r\\nso on. we shall give the name \\'sensation\\' to the experience of being\\r\\nimmediately aware of these things. thus, whenever we see a colour,\\r\\nwe have a sensation _of_ the colour, but the colour itself is a\\r\\nsense-datum, not a sensation. the colour is that _of_ which we are\\r\\nimmediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. it is\\r\\nplain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be\\r\\nby means of the sense-data--brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness,\\r\\netc.--which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have\\r\\nbeen given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even\\r\\nthat the sense-data are directly properties of the table. thus a problem\\r\\narises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing\\r\\nthere is such a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe real table, if it exists, we will call a \\'physical object\\'. thus\\r\\nwe have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects.\\r\\nthe collection of all physical objects is called \\'matter\\'. thus our two\\r\\nquestions may be re-stated as follows: (1) is there any such thing as\\r\\nmatter? (2) if so, what is its nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe philosopher who first brought prominently forward the reasons\\r\\nfor regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not existing\\r\\nindependently of us was bishop berkeley (1685-1753). his _three\\r\\ndialogues between hylas and philonous, in opposition to sceptics and\\r\\natheists_, undertake to prove that there is no such thing as matter at\\r\\nall, and that the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas.\\r\\nhylas has hitherto believed in matter, but he is no match for philonous,\\r\\nwho mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes\\r\\nhis own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common\\r\\nsense. the arguments employed are of very different value: some are\\r\\nimportant and sound, others are confused or quibbling. but berkeley\\r\\nretains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is\\r\\ncapable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any\\r\\nthings that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate\\r\\nobjects of our sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter\\r\\nexists, and it is important to keep them clear. we commonly mean by\\r\\n\\'matter\\' something which is opposed to \\'mind\\', something which we think\\r\\nof as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought\\r\\nor consciousness. it is chiefly in this sense that berkeley denies\\r\\nmatter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we\\r\\ncommonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs\\r\\nof the existence of _something_ independent of us, but he does deny\\r\\nthat this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas\\r\\nentertained by some mind. he admits that there must be something which\\r\\ncontinues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that\\r\\nwhat we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing\\r\\nin something which persists even when we are not seeing it. but he\\r\\nthinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from\\r\\nwhat we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it\\r\\nmust be independent of _our_ seeing. he is thus led to regard the \\'real\\'\\r\\ntable as an idea in the mind of god. such an idea has the required\\r\\npermanence and independence of ourselves, without being--as matter would\\r\\notherwise be--something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only\\r\\ninfer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nother philosophers since berkeley have also held that, although the\\r\\ntable does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does\\r\\ndepend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by\\r\\n_some_ mind--not necessarily the mind of god, but more often the whole\\r\\ncollective mind of the universe. this they hold, as berkeley does,\\r\\nchiefly because they think there can be nothing real--or at any rate\\r\\nnothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings.\\r\\nwe might state the argument by which they support their view in some\\r\\nsuch way as this: \\'whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of\\r\\nthe person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except\\r\\nideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is\\r\\ninconceivable cannot exist.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course those who\\r\\nadvance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. but whether valid or\\r\\nnot, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another;\\r\\nand very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is\\r\\nnothing real except minds and their ideas. such philosophers are called\\r\\n\\'idealists\\'. when they come to explaining matter, they either say, like\\r\\nberkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas,\\r\\nor they say, like leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is\\r\\nreally a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind,\\r\\nnevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. it will be remembered that\\r\\nwe asked two questions; namely, (1) is there a real table at all? (2) if\\r\\nso, what sort of object can it be? now both berkeley and leibniz admit\\r\\nthat there is a real table, but berkeley says it is certain ideas in the\\r\\nmind of god, and leibniz says it is a colony of souls. thus both of them\\r\\nanswer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the\\r\\nviews of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. in\\r\\nfact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real\\r\\ntable: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data--colour,\\r\\nshape, smoothness, etc.--may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is\\r\\na sign of something existing independently of us, something differing,\\r\\nperhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as\\r\\ncausing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the\\r\\nreal table.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed--the view\\r\\nthat there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be--is vitally\\r\\nimportant, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are\\r\\nfor accepting this view before we go on to the further question as\\r\\nto the nature of the real table. our next chapter, therefore, will be\\r\\nconcerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it\\r\\nis that we have discovered so far. it has appeared that, if we take any\\r\\ncommon object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses,\\r\\nwhat the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object\\r\\nas it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data\\r\\nwhich, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and\\r\\nthe object. thus what we directly see and feel is merely \\'appearance\\',\\r\\nwhich we believe to be a sign of some \\'reality\\' behind. but if the\\r\\nreality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there\\r\\nis any reality at all? and if so, have we any means of finding out what\\r\\nit is like?\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even\\r\\nthe strangest hypotheses may not be true. thus our familiar table,\\r\\nwhich has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a\\r\\nproblem full of surprising possibilities. the one thing we know about it\\r\\nis that it is not what it seems. beyond this modest result, so far, we\\r\\nhave the most complete liberty of conjecture. leibniz tells us it is a\\r\\ncommunity of souls: berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of god;\\r\\nsober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection\\r\\nof electric charges in violent motion.\\r\\n\\r\\namong these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there\\r\\nis no table at all. philosophy, if it cannot _answer_ so many questions\\r\\nas we could wish, has at least the power of _asking_ questions which\\r\\nincrease the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder\\r\\nlying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter ii. the existence of matter\\r\\n\\r\\nin this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all,\\r\\nthere is such a thing as matter. is there a table which has a certain\\r\\nintrinsic nature, and continues to exist when i am not looking, or is\\r\\nthe table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very\\r\\nprolonged dream? this question is of the greatest importance. for if\\r\\nwe cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot\\r\\nbe sure of the independent existence of other people\\'s bodies, and\\r\\ntherefore still less of other people\\'s minds, since we have no grounds\\r\\nfor believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing\\r\\ntheir bodies. thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of\\r\\nobjects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole\\r\\nouter world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. this is an\\r\\nuncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to\\r\\nbe false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true.\\r\\nin this chapter we have to see why this is the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore we embark upon doubtful matters, let us try to find some more\\r\\nor less fixed point from which to start. although we are doubting the\\r\\nphysical existence of the table, we are not doubting the existence\\r\\nof the sense-data which made us think there was a table; we are not\\r\\ndoubting that, while we look, a certain colour and shape appear to us,\\r\\nand while we press, a certain sensation of hardness is experienced by\\r\\nus. all this, which is psychological, we are not calling in question.\\r\\nin fact, whatever else may be doubtful, some at least of our immediate\\r\\nexperiences seem absolutely certain.\\r\\n\\r\\ndescartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a\\r\\nmethod which may still be used with profit--the method of systematic\\r\\ndoubt. he determined that he would believe nothing which he did not see\\r\\nquite clearly and distinctly to be true. whatever he could bring himself\\r\\nto doubt, he would doubt, until he saw reason for not doubting it.\\r\\nby applying this method he gradually became convinced that the only\\r\\nexistence of which he could be _quite_ certain was his own. he imagined\\r\\na deceitful demon, who presented unreal things to his senses in a\\r\\nperpetual phantasmagoria; it might be very improbable that such a demon\\r\\nexisted, but still it was possible, and therefore doubt concerning\\r\\nthings perceived by the senses was possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut doubt concerning his own existence was not possible, for if he did\\r\\nnot exist, no demon could deceive him. if he doubted, he must exist; if\\r\\nhe had any experiences whatever, he must exist. thus his own existence\\r\\nwas an absolute certainty to him. \\'i think, therefore i am,\\' he said\\r\\n(_cogito, ergo sum_); and on the basis of this certainty he set to work\\r\\nto build up again the world of knowledge which his doubt had laid in\\r\\nruins. by inventing the method of doubt, and by showing that subjective\\r\\nthings are the most certain, descartes performed a great service to\\r\\nphilosophy, and one which makes him still useful to all students of the\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut some care is needed in using descartes\\' argument. \\'i think,\\r\\ntherefore i am\\' says rather more than is strictly certain. it might seem\\r\\nas though we were quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were\\r\\nyesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. but the real self is\\r\\nas hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that\\r\\nabsolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.\\r\\nwhen i look at my table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite\\r\\ncertain at once is not \\'_i_ am seeing a brown colour\\', but rather,\\r\\n\\'a brown colour is being seen\\'. this of course involves something (or\\r\\nsomebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour; but it does not of\\r\\nitself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call \\'i\\'. so\\r\\nfar as immediate certainty goes, it might be that the something which\\r\\nsees the brown colour is quite momentary, and not the same as the\\r\\nsomething which has some different experience the next moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus it is our particular thoughts and feelings that have primitive\\r\\ncertainty. and this applies to dreams and hallucinations as well as to\\r\\nnormal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, we certainly do have\\r\\nthe sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that\\r\\nno physical object corresponds to these sensations. thus the certainty\\r\\nof our knowledge of our own experiences does not have to be limited in\\r\\nany way to allow for exceptional cases. here, therefore, we have, for\\r\\nwhat it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem we have to consider is this: granted that we are certain of\\r\\nour own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs of\\r\\nthe existence of something else, which we can call the physical object?\\r\\nwhen we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally\\r\\nregard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say\\r\\nabout the table, or is there still something else--something not a\\r\\nsense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? common\\r\\nsense unhesitatingly answers that there is. what can be bought and sold\\r\\nand pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be\\r\\na _mere_ collection of sense-data. if the cloth completely hides the\\r\\ntable, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if\\r\\nthe table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and\\r\\nthe cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in\\r\\nthe place where the table formerly was. this seems plainly absurd; but\\r\\nwhoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened\\r\\nby absurdities.\\r\\n\\r\\none great reason why it is felt that we must secure a physical object\\r\\nin addition to the sense-data, is that we want the same object for\\r\\ndifferent people. when ten people are sitting round a dinner-table,\\r\\nit seems preposterous to maintain that they are not seeing the same\\r\\ntablecloth, the same knives and forks and spoons and glasses. but the\\r\\nsense-data are private to each separate person; what is immediately\\r\\npresent to the sight of one is not immediately present to the sight of\\r\\nanother: they all see things from slightly different points of view, and\\r\\ntherefore see them slightly differently. thus, if there are to be public\\r\\nneutral objects, which can be in some sense known to many different\\r\\npeople, there must be something over and above the private and\\r\\nparticular sense-data which appear to various people. what reason, then,\\r\\nhave we for believing that there are such public neutral objects?\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first answer that naturally occurs to one is that, although\\r\\ndifferent people may see the table slightly differently, still they all\\r\\nsee more or less similar things when they look at the table, and\\r\\nthe variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and\\r\\nreflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object\\r\\nunderlying all the different people\\'s sense-data. i bought my table from\\r\\nthe former occupant of my room; i could not buy _his_ sense-data,\\r\\nwhich died when he went away, but i could and did buy the confident\\r\\nexpectation of more or less similar sense-data. thus it is the fact that\\r\\ndifferent people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given\\r\\nplace at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose\\r\\nthat over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object\\r\\nwhich underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various\\r\\ntimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow in so far as the above considerations depend upon supposing that\\r\\nthere are other people besides ourselves, they beg the very question at\\r\\nissue. other people are represented to me by certain sense-data, such as\\r\\nthe sight of them or the sound of their voices, and if i had no\\r\\nreason to believe that there were physical objects independent of my\\r\\nsense-data, i should have no reason to believe that other people exist\\r\\nexcept as part of my dream. thus, when we are trying to show that there\\r\\nmust be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to\\r\\nthe testimony of other people, since this testimony itself consists of\\r\\nsense-data, and does not reveal other people\\'s experiences unless our\\r\\nown sense-data are signs of things existing independently of us. we must\\r\\ntherefore, if possible, find, in our own purely private experiences,\\r\\ncharacteristics which show, or tend to show, that there are in the world\\r\\nthings other than ourselves and our private experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nin one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence\\r\\nof things other than ourselves and our experiences. no logical absurdity\\r\\nresults from the hypothesis that the world consists of myself and my\\r\\nthoughts and feelings and sensations, and that everything else is mere\\r\\nfancy. in dreams a very complicated world may seem to be present, and\\r\\nyet on waking we find it was a delusion; that is to say, we find that\\r\\nthe sense-data in the dream do not appear to have corresponded with such\\r\\nphysical objects as we should naturally infer from our sense-data. (it\\r\\nis true that, when the physical world is assumed, it is possible to\\r\\nfind physical causes for the sense-data in dreams: a door banging, for\\r\\ninstance, may cause us to dream of a naval engagement. but although, in\\r\\nthis case, there is a physical cause for the sense-data, there is not a\\r\\nphysical object corresponding to the sense-data in the way in which an\\r\\nactual naval battle would correspond.) there is no logical impossibility\\r\\nin the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we\\r\\nourselves create all the objects that come before us. but although this\\r\\nis not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that\\r\\nit is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a\\r\\nmeans of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense\\r\\nhypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action\\r\\non us causes our sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really\\r\\nare physical objects is easily seen. if the cat appears at one moment in\\r\\none part of the room, and at another in another part, it is natural\\r\\nto suppose that it has moved from the one to the other, passing over\\r\\na series of intermediate positions. but if it is merely a set of\\r\\nsense-data, it cannot have ever been in any place where i did not see\\r\\nit; thus we shall have to suppose that it did not exist at all while i\\r\\nwas not looking, but suddenly sprang into being in a new place. if\\r\\nthe cat exists whether i see it or not, we can understand from our own\\r\\nexperience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next; but if\\r\\nit does not exist when i am not seeing it, it seems odd that appetite\\r\\nshould grow during non-existence as fast as during existence. and if the\\r\\ncat consists only of sense-data, it cannot be hungry, since no hunger\\r\\nbut my own can be a sense-datum to me. thus the behaviour of the\\r\\nsense-data which represent the cat to me, though it seems quite natural\\r\\nwhen regarded as an expression of hunger, becomes utterly inexplicable\\r\\nwhen regarded as mere movements and changes of patches of colour, which\\r\\nare as incapable of hunger as a triangle is of playing football.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the\\r\\ndifficulty in the case of human beings. when human beings speak--that\\r\\nis, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and\\r\\nsimultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it\\r\\nis very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression\\r\\nof a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. of\\r\\ncourse similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the\\r\\nexistence of other people. but dreams are more or less suggested by what\\r\\nwe call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for\\r\\non scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical\\r\\nworld. thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural\\r\\nview, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our\\r\\nsense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nof course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in\\r\\nan independent external world. we find this belief ready in ourselves as\\r\\nsoon as we begin to reflect: it is what may be called an _instinctive_\\r\\nbelief. we should never have been led to question this belief but for\\r\\nthe fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, it seems as if the\\r\\nsense-datum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent\\r\\nobject, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical\\r\\nwith the sense-datum. this discovery, however--which is not at all\\r\\nparadoxical in the case of taste and smell and sound, and only slightly\\r\\nso in the case of touch--leaves undiminished our instinctive belief that\\r\\nthere _are_ objects _corresponding_ to our sense-data. since this belief\\r\\ndoes not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify\\r\\nand systematize our account of our experiences, there seems no good\\r\\nreason for rejecting it. we may therefore admit--though with a slight\\r\\ndoubt derived from dreams--that the external world does really exist,\\r\\nand is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to\\r\\nperceive it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe argument which has led us to this conclusion is doubtless less\\r\\nstrong than we could wish, but it is typical of many philosophical\\r\\narguments, and it is therefore worth while to consider briefly its\\r\\ngeneral character and validity. all knowledge, we find, must be built\\r\\nup upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing\\r\\nis left. but among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than\\r\\nothers, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with\\r\\nother beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part\\r\\nof what is believed instinctively.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs,\\r\\nbeginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much\\r\\nisolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. it should\\r\\ntake care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth,\\r\\nour instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system.\\r\\nthere can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief\\r\\nexcept that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to\\r\\nharmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is of course _possible_ that all or any of our beliefs may be\\r\\nmistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight\\r\\nelement of doubt. but we cannot have _reason_ to reject a belief except\\r\\non the ground of some other belief. hence, by organizing our instinctive\\r\\nbeliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most\\r\\npossible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the\\r\\nbasis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an\\r\\norderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the\\r\\n_possibility_ of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the\\r\\ninterrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has\\r\\npreceded acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis function, at least, philosophy can perform. most philosophers,\\r\\nrightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than\\r\\nthis--that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attainable,\\r\\nconcerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of\\r\\nultimate reality. whether this be the case or not, the more modest\\r\\nfunction we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and\\r\\ncertainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequacy\\r\\nof common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that\\r\\nphilosophical problems involve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter iii. the nature of matter\\r\\n\\r\\nin the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to\\r\\nfind demonstrative reasons, that it is rational to believe that our\\r\\nsense-data--for example, those which we regard as associated with my\\r\\ntable--are really signs of the existence of something independent of us\\r\\nand our perceptions. that is to say, over and above the sensations of\\r\\ncolour, hardness, noise, and so on, which make up the appearance of\\r\\nthe table to me, i assume that there is something else, of which these\\r\\nthings are appearances. the colour ceases to exist if i shut my eyes,\\r\\nthe sensation of hardness ceases to exist if i remove my arm from\\r\\ncontact with the table, the sound ceases to exist if i cease to rap the\\r\\ntable with my knuckles. but i do not believe that when all these things\\r\\ncease the table ceases. on the contrary, i believe that it is because\\r\\nthe table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear\\r\\nwhen i open my eyes, replace my arm, and begin again to rap with my\\r\\nknuckles. the question we have to consider in this chapter is: what\\r\\nis the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my\\r\\nperception of it?\\r\\n\\r\\nto this question physical science gives an answer, somewhat incomplete\\r\\nit is true, and in part still very hypothetical, but yet deserving of\\r\\nrespect so far as it goes. physical science, more or less unconsciously,\\r\\nhas drifted into the view that all natural phenomena ought to be reduced\\r\\nto motions. light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions, which\\r\\ntravel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels\\r\\nheat or hears sound. that which has the wave-motion is either aether or\\r\\n\\'gross matter\\', but in either case is what the philosopher would call\\r\\nmatter. the only properties which science assigns to it are position in\\r\\nspace, and the power of motion according to the laws of motion. science\\r\\ndoes not deny that it _may_ have other properties; but if so, such other\\r\\nproperties are not useful to the man of science, and in no way assist\\r\\nhim in explaining the phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is sometimes said that \\'light _is_ a form of wave-motion\\', but this\\r\\nis misleading, for the light which we immediately see, which we know\\r\\ndirectly by means of our senses, is _not_ a form of wave-motion, but\\r\\nsomething quite different--something which we all know if we are not\\r\\nblind, though we cannot describe it so as to convey our knowledge to a\\r\\nman who is blind. a wave-motion, on the contrary, could quite well be\\r\\ndescribed to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by\\r\\nthe sense of touch; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage\\r\\nalmost as well as we can. but this, which a blind man can understand, is\\r\\nnot what we mean by _light_: we mean by _light_ just that which a blind\\r\\nman can never understand, and which we can never describe to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow this something, which all of us who are not blind know, is not,\\r\\naccording to science, really to be found in the outer world: it is\\r\\nsomething caused by the action of certain waves upon the eyes and nerves\\r\\nand brain of the person who sees the light. when it is said that light\\r\\n_is_ waves, what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of\\r\\nour sensations of light. but light itself, the thing which seeing people\\r\\nexperience and blind people do not, is not supposed by science to form\\r\\nany part of the world that is independent of us and our senses. and very\\r\\nsimilar remarks would apply to other kinds of sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not only colours and sounds and so on that are absent from the\\r\\nscientific world of matter, but also _space_ as we get it through sight\\r\\nor touch. it is essential to science that its matter should be in _a_\\r\\nspace, but the space in which it is cannot be exactly the space we see\\r\\nor feel. to begin with, space as we see it is not the same as space as\\r\\nwe get it by the sense of touch; it is only by experience in infancy\\r\\nthat we learn how to touch things we see, or how to get a sight of\\r\\nthings which we feel touching us. but the space of science is neutral as\\r\\nbetween touch and sight; thus it cannot be either the space of touch or\\r\\nthe space of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, different people see the same object as of different shapes,\\r\\naccording to their point of view. a circular coin, for example, though\\r\\nwe should always _judge_ it to be circular, will _look_ oval unless we\\r\\nare straight in front of it. when we judge that it _is_ circular, we are\\r\\njudging that it has a real shape which is not its apparent shape, but\\r\\nbelongs to it intrinsically apart from its appearance. but this real\\r\\nshape, which is what concerns science, must be in a real space, not\\r\\nthe same as anybody\\'s _apparent_ space. the real space is public, the\\r\\napparent space is private to the percipient. in different people\\'s\\r\\n_private_ spaces the same object seems to have different shapes; thus\\r\\nthe real space, in which it has its real shape, must be different from\\r\\nthe private spaces. the space of science, therefore, though _connected_\\r\\nwith the spaces we see and feel, is not identical with them, and the\\r\\nmanner of its connexion requires investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe agreed provisionally that physical objects cannot be quite like\\r\\nour sense-data, but may be regarded as _causing_ our sensations.\\r\\nthese physical objects are in the space of science, which we may call\\r\\n\\'physical\\' space. it is important to notice that, if our sensations\\r\\nare to be caused by physical objects, there must be a physical space\\r\\ncontaining these objects and our sense-organs and nerves and brain. we\\r\\nget a sensation of touch from an object when we are in contact with it;\\r\\nthat is to say, when some part of our body occupies a place in physical\\r\\nspace quite close to the space occupied by the object. we see an object\\r\\n(roughly speaking) when no opaque body is between the object and our\\r\\neyes in physical space. similarly, we only hear or smell or taste an\\r\\nobject when we are sufficiently near to it, or when it touches the\\r\\ntongue, or has some suitable position in physical space relatively to\\r\\nour body. we cannot begin to state what different sensations we shall\\r\\nderive from a given object under different circumstances unless we\\r\\nregard the object and our body as both in one physical space, for it is\\r\\nmainly the relative positions of the object and our body that determine\\r\\nwhat sensations we shall derive from the object.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow our sense-data are situated in our private spaces, either the space\\r\\nof sight or the space of touch or such vaguer spaces as other senses\\r\\nmay give us. if, as science and common sense assume, there is one public\\r\\nall-embracing physical space in which physical objects are, the relative\\r\\npositions of physical objects in physical space must more or less\\r\\ncorrespond to the relative positions of sense-data in our private\\r\\nspaces. there is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case. if we\\r\\nsee on a road one house nearer to us than another, our other senses will\\r\\nbear out the view that it is nearer; for example, it will be reached\\r\\nsooner if we walk along the road. other people will agree that the house\\r\\nwhich looks nearer to us is nearer; the ordnance map will take the\\r\\nsame view; and thus everything points to a spatial relation between the\\r\\nhouses corresponding to the relation between the sense-data which we see\\r\\nwhen we look at the houses. thus we may assume that there is a physical\\r\\nspace in which physical objects have spatial relations corresponding to\\r\\nthose which the corresponding sense-data have in our private spaces. it\\r\\nis this physical space which is dealt with in geometry and assumed in\\r\\nphysics and astronomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nassuming that there is physical space, and that it does thus correspond\\r\\nto private spaces, what can we know about it? we can know _only_ what is\\r\\nrequired in order to secure the correspondence. that is to say, we can\\r\\nknow nothing of what it is like in itself, but we can know the sort\\r\\nof arrangement of physical objects which results from their spatial\\r\\nrelations. we can know, for example, that the earth and moon and sun\\r\\nare in one straight line during an eclipse, though we cannot know what\\r\\na physical straight line is in itself, as we know the look of a straight\\r\\nline in our visual space. thus we come to know much more about the\\r\\n_relations_ of distances in physical space than about the distances\\r\\nthemselves; we may know that one distance is greater than another, or\\r\\nthat it is along the same straight line as the other, but we cannot have\\r\\nthat immediate acquaintance with physical distances that we have with\\r\\ndistances in our private spaces, or with colours or sounds or other\\r\\nsense-data. we can know all those things about physical space which a\\r\\nman born blind might know through other people about the space of sight;\\r\\nbut the kind of things which a man born blind could never know about the\\r\\nspace of sight we also cannot know about physical space. we can know the\\r\\nproperties of the relations required to preserve the correspondence with\\r\\nsense-data, but we cannot know the nature of the terms between which the\\r\\nrelations hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nwith regard to time, our _feeling_ of duration or of the lapse of time\\r\\nis notoriously an unsafe guide as to the time that has elapsed by the\\r\\nclock. times when we are bored or suffering pain pass slowly, times when\\r\\nwe are agreeably occupied pass quickly, and times when we are sleeping\\r\\npass almost as if they did not exist. thus, in so far as time is\\r\\nconstituted by duration, there is the same necessity for distinguishing\\r\\na public and a private time as there was in the case of space. but in so\\r\\nfar as time consists in an _order_ of before and after, there is no need\\r\\nto make such a distinction; the time-order which events seem to have is,\\r\\nso far as we can see, the same as the time-order which they do have. at\\r\\nany rate no reason can be given for supposing that the two orders are\\r\\nnot the same. the same is usually true of space: if a regiment of men\\r\\nare marching along a road, the shape of the regiment will look different\\r\\nfrom different points of view, but the men will appear arranged in the\\r\\nsame order from all points of view. hence we regard the order as true\\r\\nalso in physical space, whereas the shape is only supposed to correspond\\r\\nto the physical space so far as is required for the preservation of the\\r\\norder.\\r\\n\\r\\nin saying that the time-order which events seem to have is the same as\\r\\nthe time-order which they really have, it is necessary to guard against\\r\\na possible misunderstanding. it must not be supposed that the various\\r\\nstates of different physical objects have the same time-order as the\\r\\nsense-data which constitute the perceptions of those objects. considered\\r\\nas physical objects, the thunder and lightning are simultaneous; that is\\r\\nto say, the lightning is simultaneous with the disturbance of the air in\\r\\nthe place where the disturbance begins, namely, where the lightning\\r\\nis. but the sense-datum which we call hearing the thunder does not take\\r\\nplace until the disturbance of the air has travelled as far as to where\\r\\nwe are. similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun\\'s light\\r\\nto reach us; thus, when we see the sun we are seeing the sun of eight\\r\\nminutes ago. so far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical\\r\\nsun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if\\r\\nthe physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that\\r\\nwould make no difference to the sense-data which we call \\'seeing\\r\\nthe sun\\'. this affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of\\r\\ndistinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat we have found as regards space is much the same as what we find\\r\\nin relation to the correspondence of the sense-data with their\\r\\nphysical counterparts. if one object looks blue and another red, we may\\r\\nreasonably presume that there is some corresponding difference between\\r\\nthe physical objects; if two objects both look blue, we may presume a\\r\\ncorresponding similarity. but we cannot hope to be acquainted directly\\r\\nwith the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red.\\r\\nscience tells us that this quality is a certain sort of wave-motion, and\\r\\nthis sounds familiar, because we think of wave-motions in the space we\\r\\nsee. but the wave-motions must really be in physical space, with which\\r\\nwe have no direct acquaintance; thus the real wave-motions have not that\\r\\nfamiliarity which we might have supposed them to have. and what holds\\r\\nfor colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data. thus\\r\\nwe find that, although the _relations_ of physical objects have all\\r\\nsorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the\\r\\nrelations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown\\r\\nin their intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means\\r\\nof the senses. the question remains whether there is any other method of\\r\\ndiscovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe most natural, though not ultimately the most defensible, hypothesis\\r\\nto adopt in the first instance, at any rate as regards visual\\r\\nsense-data, would be that, though physical objects cannot, for the\\r\\nreasons we have been considering, be _exactly_ like sense-data, yet they\\r\\nmay be more or less like. according to this view, physical objects will,\\r\\nfor example, really have colours, and we might, by good luck, see an\\r\\nobject as of the colour it really is. the colour which an object seems\\r\\nto have at any given moment will in general be very similar, though\\r\\nnot quite the same, from many different points of view; we might thus\\r\\nsuppose the \\'real\\' colour to be a sort of medium colour, intermediate\\r\\nbetween the various shades which appear from the different points of\\r\\nview.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch a theory is perhaps not capable of being definitely refuted, but\\r\\nit can be shown to be groundless. to begin with, it is plain that the\\r\\ncolour we see depends only upon the nature of the light-waves that\\r\\nstrike the eye, and is therefore modified by the medium intervening\\r\\nbetween us and the object, as well as by the manner in which light is\\r\\nreflected from the object in the direction of the eye. the intervening\\r\\nair alters colours unless it is perfectly clear, and any strong\\r\\nreflection will alter them completely. thus the colour we see is a\\r\\nresult of the ray as it reaches the eye, and not simply a property of\\r\\nthe object from which the ray comes. hence, also, provided certain waves\\r\\nreach the eye, we shall see a certain colour, whether the object from\\r\\nwhich the waves start has any colour or not. thus it is quite gratuitous\\r\\nto suppose that physical objects have colours, and therefore there is no\\r\\njustification for making such a supposition. exactly similar arguments\\r\\nwill apply to other sense-data.\\r\\n\\r\\nit remains to ask whether there are any general philosophical arguments\\r\\nenabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such\\r\\na nature. as explained above, very many philosophers, perhaps most, have\\r\\nheld that whatever is real must be in some sense mental, or at any rate\\r\\nthat whatever we can know anything about must be in some sense mental.\\r\\nsuch philosophers are called \\'idealists\\'. idealists tell us that what\\r\\nappears as matter is really something mental; namely, either (as leibniz\\r\\nheld) more or less rudimentary minds, or (as berkeley contended) ideas\\r\\nin the minds which, as we should commonly say, \\'perceive\\' the matter.\\r\\nthus idealists deny the existence of matter as something intrinsically\\r\\ndifferent from mind, though they do not deny that our sense-data are\\r\\nsigns of something which exists independently of our private sensations.\\r\\nin the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons--in my\\r\\nopinion fallacious--which idealists advance in favour of their theory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter iv. idealism\\r\\n\\r\\nthe word \\'idealism\\' is used by different philosophers in somewhat\\r\\ndifferent senses. we shall understand by it the doctrine that whatever\\r\\nexists, or at any rate whatever can be known to exist, must be in\\r\\nsome sense mental. this doctrine, which is very widely held among\\r\\nphilosophers, has several forms, and is advocated on several different\\r\\ngrounds. the doctrine is so widely held, and so interesting in itself,\\r\\nthat even the briefest survey of philosophy must give some account of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nthose who are unaccustomed to philosophical speculation may be inclined\\r\\nto dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd. there is no doubt that\\r\\ncommon sense regards tables and chairs and the sun and moon and material\\r\\nobjects generally as something radically different from minds and the\\r\\ncontents of minds, and as having an existence which might continue if\\r\\nminds ceased. we think of matter as having existed long before there\\r\\nwere any minds, and it is hard to think of it as a mere product of\\r\\nmental activity. but whether true or false, idealism is not to be\\r\\ndismissed as obviously absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have seen that, even if physical objects do have an independent\\r\\nexistence, they must differ very widely from sense-data, and can only\\r\\nhave a _correspondence_ with sense-data, in the same sort of way in\\r\\nwhich a catalogue has a correspondence with the things catalogued. hence\\r\\ncommon sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true intrinsic\\r\\nnature of physical objects, and if there were good reason to regard them\\r\\nas mental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because\\r\\nit strikes us as strange. the truth about physical objects _must_ be\\r\\nstrange. it may be unattainable, but if any philosopher believes that\\r\\nhe has attained it, the fact that what he offers as the truth is strange\\r\\nought not to be made a ground of objection to his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived\\r\\nfrom the theory of knowledge, that is to say, from a discussion of the\\r\\nconditions which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to\\r\\nknow them. the first serious attempt to establish idealism on such\\r\\ngrounds was that of bishop berkeley. he proved first, by arguments which\\r\\nwere largely valid, that our sense-data cannot be supposed to have an\\r\\nexistence independent of us, but must be, in part at least, \\'in\\' the\\r\\nmind, in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were\\r\\nno seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting. so far, his\\r\\ncontention was almost certainly valid, even if some of his arguments\\r\\nwere not so. but he went on to argue that sense-data were the only\\r\\nthings of whose existence our perceptions could assure us; and that\\r\\nto be known is to be \\'in\\' a mind, and therefore to be mental. hence he\\r\\nconcluded that nothing can ever be known except what is in some mind,\\r\\nand that whatever is known without being in my mind must be in some\\r\\nother mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nin order to understand his argument, it is necessary to understand his\\r\\nuse of the word \\'idea\\'. he gives the name \\'idea\\' to anything which\\r\\nis _immediately_ known, as, for example, sense-data are known. thus a\\r\\nparticular colour which we see is an idea; so is a voice which we hear,\\r\\nand so on. but the term is not wholly confined to sense-data. there will\\r\\nalso be things remembered or imagined, for with such things also we have\\r\\nimmediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining. all\\r\\nsuch immediate data he calls \\'ideas\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nhe then proceeds to consider common objects, such as a tree, for\\r\\ninstance. he shows that all we know immediately when we \\'perceive\\' the\\r\\ntree consists of ideas in his sense of the word, and he argues that\\r\\nthere is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything\\r\\nreal about the tree except what is perceived. its being, he says,\\r\\nconsists in being perceived: in the latin of the schoolmen its \\'_esse_\\'\\r\\nis \\'_percipi_\\'. he fully admits that the tree must continue to exist\\r\\neven when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it. but this\\r\\ncontinued existence, he says, is due to the fact that god continues to\\r\\nperceive it; the \\'real\\' tree, which corresponds to what we called the\\r\\nphysical object, consists of ideas in the mind of god, ideas more or\\r\\nless like those we have when we see the tree, but differing in the fact\\r\\nthat they are permanent in god\\'s mind so long as the tree continues\\r\\nto exist. all our perceptions, according to him, consist in a\\r\\npartial participation in god\\'s perceptions, and it is because of this\\r\\nparticipation that different people see more or less the same tree. thus\\r\\napart from minds and their ideas there is nothing in the world, nor is\\r\\nit possible that anything else should ever be known, since whatever is\\r\\nknown is necessarily an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are in this argument a good many fallacies which have been\\r\\nimportant in the history of philosophy, and which it will be as well to\\r\\nbring to light. in the first place, there is a confusion engendered by\\r\\nthe use of the word \\'idea\\'. we think of an idea as essentially something\\r\\nin somebody\\'s mind, and thus when we are told that a tree consists\\r\\nentirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, if so, the tree\\r\\nmust be entirely in minds. but the notion of being \\'in\\' the mind is\\r\\nambiguous. we speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that the\\r\\nperson is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. when\\r\\na man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his\\r\\nmind, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his\\r\\nmind, but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind,\\r\\nbut afterwards ceased to be in his mind. and so when berkeley says that\\r\\nthe tree must be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has\\r\\na right to say is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. to\\r\\nargue that the tree itself must be in our minds is like arguing that a\\r\\nperson whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds. this confusion\\r\\nmay seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent\\r\\nphilosopher, but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible.\\r\\nin order to see how it was possible, we must go more deeply into the\\r\\nquestion as to the nature of ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must\\r\\ndisentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning\\r\\nsense-data and physical objects. we saw that, for various reasons of\\r\\ndetail, berkeley was right in treating the sense-data which constitute\\r\\nour perception of the tree as more or less subjective, in the sense that\\r\\nthey depend upon us as much as upon the tree, and would not exist if the\\r\\ntree were not being perceived. but this is an entirely different point\\r\\nfrom the one by which berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be\\r\\nimmediately known must be in a mind. for this purpose arguments of\\r\\ndetail as to the dependence of sense-data upon us are useless. it is\\r\\nnecessary to prove, generally, that by being known, things are shown to\\r\\nbe mental. this is what berkeley believes himself to have done. it\\r\\nis this question, and not our previous question as to the difference\\r\\nbetween sense-data and the physical object, that must now concern us.\\r\\n\\r\\ntaking the word \\'idea\\' in berkeley\\'s sense, there are two quite distinct\\r\\nthings to be considered whenever an idea is before the mind. there is\\r\\non the one hand the thing of which we are aware--say the colour of my\\r\\ntable--and on the other hand the actual awareness itself, the mental act\\r\\nof apprehending the thing. the mental act is undoubtedly mental, but is\\r\\nthere any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense\\r\\nmental? our previous arguments concerning the colour did not prove it to\\r\\nbe mental; they only proved that its existence depends upon the relation\\r\\nof our sense organs to the physical object--in our case, the table. that\\r\\nis to say, they proved that a certain colour will exist, in a certain\\r\\nlight, if a normal eye is placed at a certain point relatively to\\r\\nthe table. they did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the\\r\\npercipient.\\r\\n\\r\\nberkeley\\'s view, that obviously the colour must be in the mind, seems\\r\\nto depend for its plausibility upon confusing the thing apprehended\\r\\nwith the act of apprehension. either of these might be called an \\'idea\\';\\r\\nprobably either would have been called an idea by berkeley. the act\\r\\nis undoubtedly in the mind; hence, when we are thinking of the act,\\r\\nwe readily assent to the view that ideas must be in the mind. then,\\r\\nforgetting that this was only true when ideas were taken as acts of\\r\\napprehension, we transfer the proposition that \\'ideas are in the mind\\'\\r\\nto ideas in the other sense, i.e. to the things apprehended by our acts\\r\\nof apprehension. thus, by an unconscious equivocation, we arrive at the\\r\\nconclusion that whatever we can apprehend must be in our minds. this\\r\\nseems to be the true analysis of berkeley\\'s argument, and the ultimate\\r\\nfallacy upon which it rests.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis question of the distinction between act and object in our\\r\\napprehending of things is vitally important, since our whole power of\\r\\nacquiring knowledge is bound up with it. the faculty of being acquainted\\r\\nwith things other than itself is the main characteristic of a mind.\\r\\nacquaintance with objects essentially consists in a relation between the\\r\\nmind and something other than the mind; it is this that constitutes the\\r\\nmind\\'s power of knowing things. if we say that the things known must be\\r\\nin the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind\\'s power of knowing,\\r\\nor we are uttering a mere tautology. we are uttering a mere tautology if\\r\\nwe mean by \\'_in_ the mind\\' the same as by \\'_before_ the mind\\', i.e. if\\r\\nwe mean merely being apprehended by the mind. but if we mean this, we\\r\\nshall have to admit that what, _in this sense_, is in the mind,\\r\\nmay nevertheless be not mental. thus when we realize the nature of\\r\\nknowledge, berkeley\\'s argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well\\r\\nas in form, and his grounds for supposing that \\'ideas\\'--i.e. the objects\\r\\napprehended--must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever.\\r\\nhence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed. it remains to\\r\\nsee whether there are any other grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is often said, as though it were a self-evident truism, that we\\r\\ncannot know that anything exists which we do not know. it is inferred\\r\\nthat whatever can in any way be relevant to our experience must be at\\r\\nleast capable of being known by us; whence it follows that if matter\\r\\nwere essentially something with which we could not become acquainted,\\r\\nmatter would be something which we could not know to exist, and which\\r\\ncould have for us no importance whatever. it is generally also implied,\\r\\nfor reasons which remain obscure, that what can have no importance for\\r\\nus cannot be real, and that therefore matter, if it is not composed of\\r\\nminds or of mental ideas, is impossible and a mere chimaera.\\r\\n\\r\\nto go into this argument fully at our present stage would be impossible,\\r\\nsince it raises points requiring a considerable preliminary discussion;\\r\\nbut certain reasons for rejecting the argument may be noticed at\\r\\nonce. to begin at the end: there is no reason why what cannot have any\\r\\n_practical_ importance for us should not be real. it is true that,\\r\\nif _theoretical_ importance is included, everything real is of _some_\\r\\nimportance to us, since, as persons desirous of knowing the truth about\\r\\nthe universe, we have some interest in everything that the universe\\r\\ncontains. but if this sort of interest is included, it is not the case\\r\\nthat matter has no importance for us, provided it exists even if we\\r\\ncannot know that it exists. we can, obviously, suspect that it may\\r\\nexist, and wonder whether it does; hence it is connected with our desire\\r\\nfor knowledge, and has the importance of either satisfying or thwarting\\r\\nthis desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, it is by no means a truism, and is in fact false, that we cannot\\r\\nknow that anything exists which we do not know. the word \\'know\\' is here\\r\\nused in two different senses. (1) in its first use it is applicable to\\r\\nthe sort of knowledge which is opposed to error, the sense in which\\r\\nwhat we know is _true_, the sense which applies to our beliefs and\\r\\nconvictions, i.e. to what are called _judgements_. in this sense of the\\r\\nword we know _that_ something is the case. this sort of knowledge may\\r\\nbe described as knowledge of _truths_. (2) in the second use of the word\\r\\n\\'know\\' above, the word applies to our knowledge of _things_, which we\\r\\nmay call _acquaintance_. this is the sense in which we know sense-data.\\r\\n(the distinction involved is roughly that between _savoir_ and\\r\\n_connaitre_ in french, or between _wissen_ and _kennen_ in german.)\\r\\n\\r\\nthus the statement which seemed like a truism becomes, when re-stated,\\r\\nthe following: \\'we can never truly judge that something with which we\\r\\nare not acquainted exists.\\' this is by no means a truism, but on the\\r\\ncontrary a palpable falsehood. i have not the honour to be acquainted\\r\\nwith the emperor of china, but i truly judge that he exists. it may\\r\\nbe said, of course, that i judge this because of other people\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance with him. this, however, would be an irrelevant retort,\\r\\nsince, if the principle were true, i could not know that any one else\\r\\nis acquainted with him. but further: there is no reason why i should not\\r\\nknow of the existence of something with which nobody is acquainted. this\\r\\npoint is important, and demands elucidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nif i am acquainted with a thing which exists, my acquaintance gives\\r\\nme the knowledge that it exists. but it is not true that, conversely,\\r\\nwhenever i can know that a thing of a certain sort exists, i or some one\\r\\nelse must be acquainted with the thing. what happens, in cases where i\\r\\nhave true judgement without acquaintance, is that the thing is known to\\r\\nme by _description_, and that, in virtue of some general principle, the\\r\\nexistence of a thing answering to this description can be inferred\\r\\nfrom the existence of something with which i am acquainted. in order\\r\\nto understand this point fully, it will be well first to deal with\\r\\nthe difference between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by\\r\\ndescription, and then to consider what knowledge of general principles,\\r\\nif any, has the same kind of certainty as our knowledge of the existence\\r\\nof our own experiences. these subjects will be dealt with in the\\r\\nfollowing chapters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter v. knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description\\r\\n\\r\\nin the preceding chapter we saw that there are two sorts of knowledge:\\r\\nknowledge of things, and knowledge of truths. in this chapter we shall\\r\\nbe concerned exclusively with knowledge of things, of which in turn we\\r\\nshall have to distinguish two kinds. knowledge of things, when it is\\r\\nof the kind we call knowledge by _acquaintance_, is essentially simpler\\r\\nthan any knowledge of truths, and logically independent of knowledge\\r\\nof truths, though it would be rash to assume that human beings ever,\\r\\nin fact, have acquaintance with things without at the same time knowing\\r\\nsome truth about them. knowledge of things by _description_, on the\\r\\ncontrary, always involves, as we shall find in the course of the present\\r\\nchapter, some knowledge of truths as its source and ground. but first of\\r\\nall we must make clear what we mean by \\'acquaintance\\' and what we mean\\r\\nby \\'description\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall say that we have _acquaintance_ with anything of which we are\\r\\ndirectly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference\\r\\nor any knowledge of truths. thus in the presence of my table i am\\r\\nacquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my\\r\\ntable--its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are\\r\\nthings of which i am immediately conscious when i am seeing and touching\\r\\nmy table. the particular shade of colour that i am seeing may have many\\r\\nthings said about it--i may say that it is brown, that it is rather\\r\\ndark, and so on. but such statements, though they make me know truths\\r\\nabout the colour, do not make me know the colour itself any better\\r\\nthan i did before so far as concerns knowledge of the colour itself, as\\r\\nopposed to knowledge of truths about it, i know the colour perfectly and\\r\\ncompletely when i see it, and no further knowledge of it itself is even\\r\\ntheoretically possible. thus the sense-data which make up the\\r\\nappearance of my table are things with which i have acquaintance, things\\r\\nimmediately known to me just as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy knowledge of the table as a physical object, on the contrary, is not\\r\\ndirect knowledge. such as it is, it is obtained through acquaintance\\r\\nwith the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table. we have\\r\\nseen that it is possible, without absurdity, to doubt whether there is\\r\\na table at all, whereas it is not possible to doubt the sense-data. my\\r\\nknowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call \\'knowledge\\r\\nby description\\'. the table is \\'the physical object which causes\\r\\nsuch-and-such sense-data\\'. this describes the table by means of the\\r\\nsense-data. in order to know anything at all about the table, we must\\r\\nknow truths connecting it with things with which we have acquaintance:\\r\\nwe must know that \\'such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical\\r\\nobject\\'. there is no state of mind in which we are directly aware of the\\r\\ntable; all our knowledge of the table is really knowledge of truths, and\\r\\nthe actual thing which is the table is not, strictly speaking, known\\r\\nto us at all. we know a description, and we know that there is just one\\r\\nobject to which this description applies, though the object itself is\\r\\nnot directly known to us. in such a case, we say that our knowledge of\\r\\nthe object is knowledge by description.\\r\\n\\r\\nall our knowledge, both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths,\\r\\nrests upon acquaintance as its foundation. it is therefore important to\\r\\nconsider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nsense-data, as we have already seen, are among the things with which\\r\\nwe are acquainted; in fact, they supply the most obvious and striking\\r\\nexample of knowledge by acquaintance. but if they were the sole example,\\r\\nour knowledge would be very much more restricted than it is. we should\\r\\nonly know what is now present to our senses: we could not know anything\\r\\nabout the past--not even that there was a past--nor could we know any\\r\\ntruths about our sense-data, for all knowledge of truths, as we shall\\r\\nshow, demands acquaintance with things which are of an essentially\\r\\ndifferent character from sense-data, the things which are sometimes\\r\\ncalled \\'abstract ideas\\', but which we shall call \\'universals\\'. we have\\r\\ntherefore to consider acquaintance with other things besides sense-data\\r\\nif we are to obtain any tolerably adequate analysis of our knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first extension beyond sense-data to be considered is acquaintance\\r\\nby _memory_. it is obvious that we often remember what we have seen or\\r\\nheard or had otherwise present to our senses, and that in such cases we\\r\\nare still immediately aware of what we remember, in spite of the fact\\r\\nthat it appears as past and not as present. this immediate knowledge by\\r\\nmemory is the source of all our knowledge concerning the past: without\\r\\nit, there could be no knowledge of the past by inference, since we\\r\\nshould never know that there was anything past to be inferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next extension to be considered is acquaintance by _introspection_.\\r\\nwe are not only aware of things, but we are often aware of being aware\\r\\nof them. when i see the sun, i am often aware of my seeing the sun; thus\\r\\n\\'my seeing the sun\\' is an object with which i have acquaintance. when\\r\\ni desire food, i may be aware of my desire for food; thus \\'my desiring\\r\\nfood\\' is an object with which i am acquainted. similarly we may be\\r\\naware of our feeling pleasure or pain, and generally of the events which\\r\\nhappen in our minds. this kind of acquaintance, which may be called\\r\\nself-consciousness, is the source of all our knowledge of mental things.\\r\\nit is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be\\r\\nthus known immediately. what goes on in the minds of others is known\\r\\nto us through our perception of their bodies, that is, through the\\r\\nsense-data in us which are associated with their bodies. but for our\\r\\nacquaintance with the contents of our own minds, we should be unable to\\r\\nimagine the minds of others, and therefore we could never arrive at\\r\\nthe knowledge that they have minds. it seems natural to suppose that\\r\\nself-consciousness is one of the things that distinguish men from\\r\\nanimals: animals, we may suppose, though they have acquaintance with\\r\\nsense-data, never become aware of this acquaintance. i do not mean\\r\\nthat they _doubt_ whether they exist, but that they have never become\\r\\nconscious of the fact that they have sensations and feelings, nor\\r\\ntherefore of the fact that they, the subjects of their sensations and\\r\\nfeelings, exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have spoken of acquaintance with the contents of our minds as\\r\\n_self_-consciousness, but it is not, of course, consciousness of our\\r\\n_self_: it is consciousness of particular thoughts and feelings. the\\r\\nquestion whether we are also acquainted with our bare selves, as opposed\\r\\nto particular thoughts and feelings, is a very difficult one, upon which\\r\\nit would be rash to speak positively. when we try to look into ourselves\\r\\nwe always seem to come upon some particular thought or feeling, and not\\r\\nupon the \\'i\\' which has the thought or feeling. nevertheless there are\\r\\nsome reasons for thinking that we are acquainted with the \\'i\\', though\\r\\nthe acquaintance is hard to disentangle from other things. to make clear\\r\\nwhat sort of reason there is, let us consider for a moment what our\\r\\nacquaintance with particular thoughts really involves.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i am acquainted with \\'my seeing the sun\\', it seems plain that i am\\r\\nacquainted with two different things in relation to each other. on the\\r\\none hand there is the sense-datum which represents the sun to me, on the\\r\\nother hand there is that which sees this sense-datum. all acquaintance,\\r\\nsuch as my acquaintance with the sense-datum which represents the sun,\\r\\nseems obviously a relation between the person acquainted and the object\\r\\nwith which the person is acquainted. when a case of acquaintance is one\\r\\nwith which i can be acquainted (as i am acquainted with my acquaintance\\r\\nwith the sense-datum representing the sun), it is plain that the person\\r\\nacquainted is myself. thus, when i am acquainted with my\\r\\nseeing the sun, the whole fact with which i am acquainted is\\r\\n\\'self-acquainted-with-sense-datum\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nfurther, we know the truth \\'i am acquainted with this sense-datum\\'. it\\r\\nis hard to see how we could know this truth, or even understand what is\\r\\nmeant by it, unless we were acquainted with something which we call \\'i\\'.\\r\\nit does not seem necessary to suppose that we are acquainted with a more\\r\\nor less permanent person, the same to-day as yesterday, but it does seem\\r\\nas though we must be acquainted with that thing, whatever its nature,\\r\\nwhich sees the sun and has acquaintance with sense-data. thus, in some\\r\\nsense it would seem we must be acquainted with our selves as opposed\\r\\nto our particular experiences. but the question is difficult, and\\r\\ncomplicated arguments can be adduced on either side. hence, although\\r\\nacquaintance with ourselves seems _probably_ to occur, it is not wise to\\r\\nassert that it undoubtedly does occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may therefore sum up as follows what has been said concerning\\r\\nacquaintance with things that exist. we have acquaintance in sensation\\r\\nwith the data of the outer senses, and in introspection with the data of\\r\\nwhat may be called the inner sense--thoughts, feelings, desires, etc.;\\r\\nwe have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either\\r\\nof the outer senses or of the inner sense. further, it is probable,\\r\\nthough not certain, that we have acquaintance with self, as that which\\r\\nis aware of things or has desires towards things.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition to our acquaintance with particular existing things, we also\\r\\nhave acquaintance with what we shall call _universals_, that is to say,\\r\\ngeneral ideas, such as _whiteness_, _diversity_, _brotherhood_, and so\\r\\non. every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands\\r\\nfor a universal, since all verbs have a meaning which is universal. we\\r\\nshall return to universals later on, in chapter ix; for the present, it\\r\\nis only necessary to guard against the supposition that whatever we can\\r\\nbe acquainted with must be something particular and existent. awareness\\r\\nof universals is called _conceiving_, and a universal of which we are\\r\\naware is called a _concept_.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that among the objects with which we are acquainted\\r\\nare not included physical objects (as opposed to sense-data), nor other\\r\\npeople\\'s minds. these things are known to us by what i call \\'knowledge\\r\\nby description\\', which we must now consider.\\r\\n\\r\\nby a \\'description\\' i mean any phrase of the form \\'a so-and-so\\' or\\r\\n\\'the so-and-so\\'. a phrase of the form \\'a so-and-so\\' i shall call an\\r\\n\\'ambiguous\\' description; a phrase of the form \\'the so-and-so\\' (in the\\r\\nsingular) i shall call a \\'definite\\' description. thus \\'a man\\' is an\\r\\nambiguous description, and \\'the man with the iron mask\\' is a definite\\r\\ndescription. there are various problems connected with ambiguous\\r\\ndescriptions, but i pass them by, since they do not directly concern\\r\\nthe matter we are discussing, which is the nature of our knowledge\\r\\nconcerning objects in cases where we know that there is an object\\r\\nanswering to a definite description, though we are not acquainted with\\r\\nany such object. this is a matter which is concerned exclusively with\\r\\ndefinite descriptions. i shall therefore, in the sequel, speak simply of\\r\\n\\'descriptions\\' when i mean \\'definite descriptions\\'. thus a description\\r\\nwill mean any phrase of the form \\'the so-and-so\\' in the singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall say that an object is \\'known by description\\' when we know that\\r\\nit is \\'the so-and-so\\', i.e. when we know that there is one object, and\\r\\nno more, having a certain property; and it will generally be implied\\r\\nthat we do not have knowledge of the same object by acquaintance. we\\r\\nknow that the man with the iron mask existed, and many propositions\\r\\nare known about him; but we do not know who he was. we know that the\\r\\ncandidate who gets the most votes will be elected, and in this case we\\r\\nare very likely also acquainted (in the only sense in which one can\\r\\nbe acquainted with some one else) with the man who is, in fact, the\\r\\ncandidate who will get most votes; but we do not know which of the\\r\\ncandidates he is, i.e. we do not know any proposition of the form \\'a is\\r\\nthe candidate who will get most votes\\' where a is one of the candidates\\r\\nby name. we shall say that we have \\'merely descriptive knowledge\\' of the\\r\\nso-and-so when, although we know that the so-and-so exists, and although\\r\\nwe may possibly be acquainted with the object which is, in fact, the\\r\\nso-and-so, yet we do not know any proposition \\'_a_ is the so-and-so\\',\\r\\nwhere _a_ is something with which we are acquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we say \\'the so-and-so exists\\', we mean that there is just one\\r\\nobject which is the so-and-so. the proposition \\'_a_ is the so-and-so\\'\\r\\nmeans that _a_ has the property so-and-so, and nothing else has. \\'mr.\\r\\na. is the unionist candidate for this constituency\\' means \\'mr. a. is\\r\\na unionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is\\'. \\'the\\r\\nunionist candidate for this constituency exists\\' means \\'some one is a\\r\\nunionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is\\'. thus,\\r\\nwhen we are acquainted with an object which is the so-and-so, we know\\r\\nthat the so-and-so exists; but we may know that the so-and-so exists\\r\\nwhen we are not acquainted with any object which we know to be the\\r\\nso-and-so, and even when we are not acquainted with any object which, in\\r\\nfact, is the so-and-so.\\r\\n\\r\\ncommon words, even proper names, are usually really descriptions. that\\r\\nis to say, the thought in the mind of a person using a proper name\\r\\ncorrectly can generally only be expressed explicitly if we replace the\\r\\nproper name by a description. moreover, the description required to\\r\\nexpress the thought will vary for different people, or for the same\\r\\nperson at different times. the only thing constant (so long as the name\\r\\nis rightly used) is the object to which the name applies. but so long as\\r\\nthis remains constant, the particular description involved usually makes\\r\\nno difference to the truth or falsehood of the proposition in which the\\r\\nname appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take some illustrations. suppose some statement made about\\r\\nbismarck. assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance\\r\\nwith oneself, bismarck himself might have used his name directly to\\r\\ndesignate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. in this\\r\\ncase, if he made a judgement about himself, he himself might be a\\r\\nconstituent of the judgement. here the proper name has the direct use\\r\\nwhich it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain object,\\r\\nand not for a description of the object. but if a person who knew\\r\\nbismarck made a judgement about him, the case is different. what this\\r\\nperson was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he connected\\r\\n(rightly, we will suppose) with bismarck\\'s body. his body, as a physical\\r\\nobject, and still more his mind, were only known as the body and the\\r\\nmind connected with these sense-data. that is, they were known by\\r\\ndescription. it is, of course, very much a matter af chance which\\r\\ncharacteristics of a man\\'s appearance will come into a friend\\'s mind\\r\\nwhen he thinks of him; thus the description actually in the friend\\'s\\r\\nmind is accidental. the essential point is that he knows that the\\r\\nvarious descriptions all apply to the same entity, in spite of not being\\r\\nacquainted with the entity in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we, who did not know bismarck, make a judgement about him, the\\r\\ndescription in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass\\r\\nof historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to\\r\\nidentify him. but, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\\r\\nthink of him as \\'the first chancellor of the german empire\\'. here all\\r\\nthe words are abstract except \\'german\\'. the word \\'german\\' will, again,\\r\\nhave different meanings for different people. to some it will recall\\r\\ntravels in germany, to some the look of germany on the map, and so on.\\r\\nbut if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable,\\r\\nwe shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a\\r\\nparticular with which we are acquainted. such reference is involved in\\r\\nany mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite dates),\\r\\nor of here and there, or of what others have told us. thus it would seem\\r\\nthat, in some way or other, a description known to be applicable to a\\r\\nparticular must involve some reference to a particular with which we\\r\\nare acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing described is not to be\\r\\nmerely what follows _logically_ from the description. for example, \\'the\\r\\nmost long-lived of men\\' is a description involving only universals,\\r\\nwhich must apply to some man, but we can make no judgements concerning\\r\\nthis man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the description\\r\\ngives. if, however, we say, \\'the first chancellor of the german empire\\r\\nwas an astute diplomatist\\', we can only be assured of the truth of our\\r\\njudgement in virtue of something with which we are acquainted--usually a\\r\\ntestimony heard or read. apart from the information we convey to others,\\r\\napart from the fact about the actual bismarck, which gives importance\\r\\nto our judgement, the thought we really have contains the one or more\\r\\nparticulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\nall names of places--london, england, europe, the earth, the solar\\r\\nsystem--similarly involve, when used, descriptions which start from some\\r\\none or more particulars with which we are acquainted. i suspect that\\r\\neven the universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a\\r\\nconnexion with particulars. in logic, on the contrary, where we are\\r\\nconcerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or\\r\\ncould exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem that, when we make a statement about something only known\\r\\nby description, we often _intend_ to make our statement, not in the form\\r\\ninvolving the description, but about the actual thing described. that\\r\\nis to say, when we say anything about bismarck, we should like, if we\\r\\ncould, to make the judgement which bismarck alone can make, namely,\\r\\nthe judgement of which he himself is a constituent. in this we are\\r\\nnecessarily defeated, since the actual bismarck is unknown to us. but\\r\\nwe know that there is an object b, called bismarck, and that b was an\\r\\nastute diplomatist. we can thus _describe_ the proposition we should\\r\\nlike to affirm, namely, \\'b was an astute diplomatist\\', where b is the\\r\\nobject which was bismarck. if we are describing bismarck as \\'the first\\r\\nchancellor of the german empire\\', the proposition we should like to\\r\\naffirm may be described as \\'the proposition asserting, concerning the\\r\\nactual object which was the first chancellor of the german empire, that\\r\\nthis object was an astute diplomatist\\'. what enables us to communicate\\r\\nin spite of the varying descriptions we employ is that we know there is\\r\\na true proposition concerning the actual bismarck, and that however we\\r\\nmay vary the description (so long as the description is correct) the\\r\\nproposition described is still the same. this proposition, which is\\r\\ndescribed and is known to be true, is what interests us; but we are not\\r\\nacquainted with the proposition itself, and do not know it, though we\\r\\nknow it is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from\\r\\nacquaintance with particulars: there is bismarck to people who knew him;\\r\\nbismarck to those who only know of him through history; the man with\\r\\nthe iron mask; the longest-lived of men. these are progressively further\\r\\nremoved from acquaintance with particulars; the first comes as near to\\r\\nacquaintance as is possible in regard to another person; in the second,\\r\\nwe shall still be said to know \\'who bismarck was\\'; in the third, we do\\r\\nnot know who was the man with the iron mask, though we can know many\\r\\npropositions about him which are not logically deducible from the fact\\r\\nthat he wore an iron mask; in the fourth, finally, we know nothing\\r\\nbeyond what is logically deducible from the definition of the man. there\\r\\nis a similar hierarchy in the region of universals. many universals,\\r\\nlike many particulars, are only known to us by description. but here,\\r\\nas in the case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by\\r\\ndescription is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is\\r\\nknown by acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fundamental principle in the analysis of propositions containing\\r\\ndescriptions is this: _every proposition which we can understand must be\\r\\ncomposed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted_.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which\\r\\nmay be urged against this fundamental principle. for the present, we\\r\\nshall merely point out that, in some way or other, it must be possible\\r\\nto meet these objections, for it is scarcely conceivable that we can\\r\\nmake a judgement or entertain a supposition without knowing what it is\\r\\nthat we are judging or supposing about. we must attach _some_ meaning\\r\\nto the words we use, if we are to speak significantly and not utter mere\\r\\nnoise; and the meaning we attach to our words must be something with\\r\\nwhich we are acquainted. thus when, for example, we make a statement\\r\\nabout julius caesar, it is plain that julius caesar himself is not\\r\\nbefore our minds, since we are not acquainted with him. we have in mind\\r\\nsome description of julius caesar: \\'the man who was assassinated on the\\r\\nides of march\\', \\'the founder of the roman empire\\', or, perhaps, merely\\r\\n\\'the man whose name was _julius caesar_\\'. (in this last description,\\r\\n_julius caesar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted.)\\r\\nthus our statement does not mean quite what it seems to mean, but means\\r\\nsomething involving, instead of julius caesar, some description of him\\r\\nwhich is composed wholly of particulars and universals with which we are\\r\\nacquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us\\r\\nto pass beyond the limits of our private experience. in spite of the\\r\\nfact that we can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms\\r\\nwhich we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by\\r\\ndescription of things which we have never experienced. in view of the\\r\\nvery narrow range of our immediate experience, this result is vital, and\\r\\nuntil it is understood, much of our knowledge must remain mysterious and\\r\\ntherefore doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter vi. on induction\\r\\n\\r\\nin almost all our previous discussions we have been concerned in\\r\\nthe attempt to get clear as to our data in the way of knowledge of\\r\\nexistence. what things are there in the universe whose existence is\\r\\nknown to us owing to our being acquainted with them? so far, our answer\\r\\nhas been that we are acquainted with our sense-data, and, probably,\\r\\nwith ourselves. these we know to exist. and past sense-data which\\r\\nare remembered are known to have existed in the past. this knowledge\\r\\nsupplies our data.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut if we are to be able to draw inferences from these data--if we are\\r\\nto know of the existence of matter, of other people, of the past before\\r\\nour individual memory begins, or of the future, we must know general\\r\\nprinciples of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn.\\r\\nit must be known to us that the existence of some one sort of thing, a,\\r\\nis a sign of the existence of some other sort of thing, b, either at\\r\\nthe same time as a or at some earlier or later time, as, for example,\\r\\nthunder is a sign of the earlier existence of lightning. if this were\\r\\nnot known to us, we could never extend our knowledge beyond the\\r\\nsphere of our private experience; and this sphere, as we have seen, is\\r\\nexceedingly limited. the question we have now to consider is whether\\r\\nsuch an extension is possible, and if so, how it is effected.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us, in fact,\\r\\nfeel the slightest doubt. we are all convinced that the sun will rise\\r\\nto-morrow. why? is this belief a mere blind outcome of past experience,\\r\\nor can it be justified as a reasonable belief? it is not easy to find\\r\\na test by which to judge whether a belief of this kind is reasonable or\\r\\nnot, but we can at least ascertain what sort of general beliefs would\\r\\nsuffice, if true, to justify the judgement that the sun will rise\\r\\nto-morrow, and the many other similar judgements upon which our actions\\r\\nare based.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is obvious that if we are asked why we believe that the sun will rise\\r\\nto-morrow, we shall naturally answer \\'because it always has risen every\\r\\nday\\'. we have a firm belief that it will rise in the future, because it\\r\\nhas risen in the past. if we are challenged as to why we believe that\\r\\nit will continue to rise as heretofore, we may appeal to the laws of\\r\\nmotion: the earth, we shall say, is a freely rotating body, and such\\r\\nbodies do not cease to rotate unless something interferes from outside,\\r\\nand there is nothing outside to interfere with the earth between now and\\r\\nto-morrow. of course it might be doubted whether we are quite certain\\r\\nthat there is nothing outside to interfere, but this is not the\\r\\ninteresting doubt. the interesting doubt is as to whether the laws\\r\\nof motion will remain in operation until to-morrow. if this doubt is\\r\\nraised, we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about\\r\\nthe sunrise was first raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe _only_ reason for believing that the laws of motion will remain in\\r\\noperation is that they have operated hitherto, so far as our knowledge\\r\\nof the past enables us to judge. it is true that we have a greater body\\r\\nof evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have\\r\\nin favour of the sunrise, because the sunrise is merely a particular\\r\\ncase of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other\\r\\nparticular cases. but the real question is: do _any_ number of cases\\r\\nof a law being fulfilled in the past afford evidence that it will be\\r\\nfulfilled in the future? if not, it becomes plain that we have no ground\\r\\nwhatever for expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the\\r\\nbread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, or for any of the\\r\\nother scarcely conscious expectations that control our daily lives. it\\r\\nis to be observed that all such expectations are only _probable_; thus\\r\\nwe have not to seek for a proof that they _must_ be fulfilled, but\\r\\nonly for some reason in favour of the view that they are _likely_ to be\\r\\nfulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow in dealing with this question we must, to begin with, make an\\r\\nimportant distinction, without which we should soon become involved\\r\\nin hopeless confusions. experience has shown us that, hitherto, the\\r\\nfrequent repetition of some uniform succession or coexistence has been a\\r\\n_cause_ of our expecting the same succession or coexistence on the next\\r\\noccasion. food that has a certain appearance generally has a certain\\r\\ntaste, and it is a severe shock to our expectations when the familiar\\r\\nappearance is found to be associated with an unusual taste. things which\\r\\nwe see become associated, by habit, with certain tactile sensations\\r\\nwhich we expect if we touch them; one of the horrors of a ghost (in\\r\\nmany ghost-stories) is that it fails to give us any sensations of touch.\\r\\nuneducated people who go abroad for the first time are so surprised as\\r\\nto be incredulous when they find their native language not understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nand this kind of association is not confined to men; in animals also it\\r\\nis very strong. a horse which has been often driven along a certain\\r\\nroad resists the attempt to drive him in a different direction. domestic\\r\\nanimals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. we\\r\\nknow that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable\\r\\nto be misleading. the man who has fed the chicken every day throughout\\r\\nits life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined\\r\\nviews as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the\\r\\nchicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut in spite of the misleadingness of such expectations, they\\r\\nnevertheless exist. the mere fact that something has happened a certain\\r\\nnumber of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen\\r\\nagain. thus our instincts certainly cause us to believe that the sun\\r\\nwill rise to-morrow, but we may be in no better a position than the\\r\\nchicken which unexpectedly has its neck wrung. we have therefore to\\r\\ndistinguish the fact that past uniformities _cause_ expectations as to\\r\\nthe future, from the question whether there is any reasonable ground for\\r\\ngiving weight to such expectations after the question of their validity\\r\\nhas been raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem we have to discuss is whether there is any reason for\\r\\nbelieving in what is called \\'the uniformity of nature\\'. the belief in\\r\\nthe uniformity of nature is the belief that everything that has happened\\r\\nor will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no\\r\\nexceptions. the crude expectations which we have been considering are\\r\\nall subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who\\r\\nentertain them. but science habitually assumes, at least as a working\\r\\nhypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by\\r\\ngeneral rules which have no exceptions. \\'unsupported bodies in air fall\\'\\r\\nis a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. but\\r\\nthe laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the\\r\\nfact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and\\r\\naeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation\\r\\nare not subject to these exceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe belief that the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the\\r\\nearth came suddenly into contact with a large body which destroyed its\\r\\nrotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not\\r\\nbe infringed by such an event. the business of science is to find\\r\\nuniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation,\\r\\nto which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions.\\r\\nin this search science has been remarkably successful, and it may be\\r\\nconceded that such uniformities have held hitherto. this brings us back\\r\\nto the question: have we any reason, assuming that they have always held\\r\\nin the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future?\\r\\n\\r\\nit has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will\\r\\nresemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the\\r\\npast, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really\\r\\nhave experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly\\r\\nfuture, which we may call past futures. but such an argument really begs\\r\\nthe very question at issue. we have experience of past futures, but not\\r\\nof future futures, and the question is: will future futures resemble\\r\\npast futures? this question is not to be answered by an argument which\\r\\nstarts from past futures alone. we have therefore still to seek for some\\r\\nprinciple which shall enable us to know that the future will follow the\\r\\nsame laws as the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe reference to the future in this question is not essential. the same\\r\\nquestion arises when we apply the laws that work in our experience to\\r\\npast things of which we have no experience--as, for example, in geology,\\r\\nor in theories as to the origin of the solar system. the question we\\r\\nreally have to ask is: \\'when two things have been found to be often\\r\\nassociated, and no instance is known of the one occurring without the\\r\\nother, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give\\r\\nany good ground for expecting the other?\\' on our answer to this question\\r\\nmust depend the validity of the whole of our expectations as to the\\r\\nfuture, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact\\r\\npractically all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.\\r\\n\\r\\nit must be conceded, to begin with, that the fact that two things have\\r\\nbeen found often together and never apart does not, by itself, suffice\\r\\nto _prove_ demonstratively that they will be found together in the next\\r\\ncase we examine. the most we can hope is that the oftener things are\\r\\nfound together, the more probable it becomes that they will be found\\r\\ntogether another time, and that, if they have been found together often\\r\\nenough, the probability will amount _almost_ to certainty. it can\\r\\nnever quite reach certainty, because we know that in spite of frequent\\r\\nrepetitions there sometimes is a failure at the last, as in the case\\r\\nof the chicken whose neck is wrung. thus probability is all we ought to\\r\\nseek.\\r\\n\\r\\nit might be urged, as against the view we are advocating, that we\\r\\nknow all natural phenomena to be subject to the reign of law, and that\\r\\nsometimes, on the basis of observation, we can see that only one law\\r\\ncan possibly fit the facts of the case. now to this view there are two\\r\\nanswers. the first is that, even if _some_ law which has no exceptions\\r\\napplies to our case, we can never, in practice, be sure that we have\\r\\ndiscovered that law and not one to which there are exceptions. the\\r\\nsecond is that the reign of law would seem to be itself only probable,\\r\\nand that our belief that it will hold in the future, or in unexamined\\r\\ncases in the past, is itself based upon the very principle we are\\r\\nexamining.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe principle we are examining may be called the _principle of\\r\\ninduction_, and its two parts may be stated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) when a thing of a certain sort a has been found to be associated\\r\\nwith a thing of a certain other sort b, and has never been found\\r\\ndissociated from a thing of the sort b, the greater the number of cases\\r\\nin which a and b have been associated, the greater is the probability\\r\\nthat they will be associated in a fresh case in which one of them is\\r\\nknown to be present;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of\\r\\nassociation will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a\\r\\ncertainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nas just stated, the principle applies only to the verification of our\\r\\nexpectation in a single fresh instance. but we want also to know that\\r\\nthere is a probability in favour of the general law that things of the\\r\\nsort a are _always_ associated with things of the sort b, provided a\\r\\nsufficient number of cases of association are known, and no cases of\\r\\nfailure of association are known. the probability of the general law is\\r\\nobviously less than the probability of the particular case, since if the\\r\\ngeneral law is true, the particular case must also be true, whereas\\r\\nthe particular case may be true without the general law being true.\\r\\nnevertheless the probability of the general law is increased by\\r\\nrepetitions, just as the probability of the particular case is. we may\\r\\ntherefore repeat the two parts of our principle as regards the general\\r\\nlaw, thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort a has\\r\\nbeen found associated with a thing of the sort b, the more probable it\\r\\nis (if no cases of failure of association are known) that a is always\\r\\nassociated with b;\\r\\n\\r\\nb) under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the\\r\\nassociation of a with b will make it nearly certain that a is always\\r\\nassociated with b, and will make this general law approach certainty\\r\\nwithout limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nit should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data.\\r\\nin our case, the data are merely the known cases of coexistence of a and\\r\\nb. there may be other data, which _might_ be taken into account, which\\r\\nwould gravely alter the probability. for example, a man who had seen a\\r\\ngreat many white swans might argue, by our principle, that on the\\r\\ndata it was _probable_ that all swans were white, and this might be a\\r\\nperfectly sound argument. the argument is not disproved ny the fact that\\r\\nsome swans are black, because a thing may very well happen in spite of\\r\\nthe fact that some data render it improbable. in the case of the swans,\\r\\na man might know that colour is a very variable characteristic in many\\r\\nspecies of animals, and that, therefore, an induction as to colour is\\r\\npeculiarly liable to error. but this knowledge would be a fresh datum,\\r\\nby no means proving that the probability relatively to our previous data\\r\\nhad been wrongly estimated. the fact, therefore, that things often fail\\r\\nto fulfil our expectations is no evidence that our expectations will not\\r\\n_probably_ be fulfilled in a given case or a given class of cases. thus\\r\\nour inductive principle is at any rate not capable of being _disproved_\\r\\nby an appeal to experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being _proved_\\r\\nby an appeal to experience. experience might conceivably confirm\\r\\nthe inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already\\r\\nexamined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle\\r\\nalone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what\\r\\nhas not been examined. all arguments which, on the basis of experience,\\r\\nargue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or\\r\\npresent, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use\\r\\nexperience to prove the inductive principle without begging the\\r\\nquestion. thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the\\r\\nground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our\\r\\nexpectations about the future. if the principle is unsound, we have no\\r\\nreason to expect the sun to rise to-morrow, to expect bread to be more\\r\\nnourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off\\r\\nthe roof we shall fall. when we see what looks like our best friend\\r\\napproaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not\\r\\ninhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. all\\r\\nour conduct is based upon associations which have worked in the past,\\r\\nand which we therefore regard as likely to work in the future; and this\\r\\nlikelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe general principles of science, such as the belief in the reign\\r\\nof law, and the belief that every event must have a cause, are as\\r\\ncompletely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of\\r\\ndaily life all such general principles are believed because mankind have\\r\\nfound innumerable instances of their truth and no instances of their\\r\\nfalsehood. but this affords no evidence for their truth in the future,\\r\\nunless the inductive principle is assumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus all knowledge which, on a basis of experience tells us something\\r\\nabout what is not experienced, is based upon a belief which experience\\r\\ncan neither confirm nor confute, yet which, at least in its more\\r\\nconcrete applications, appears to be as firmly rooted in us as many\\r\\nof the facts of experience. the existence and justification of such\\r\\nbeliefs--for the inductive principle, as we shall see, is not the only\\r\\nexample--raises some of the most difficult and most debated problems of\\r\\nphilosophy. we will, in the next chapter, consider briefly what may be\\r\\nsaid to account for such knowledge, and what is its scope and its degree\\r\\nof certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter vii. on our knowledge of general principles\\r\\n\\r\\nwe saw in the preceding chapter that the principle of induction, while\\r\\nnecessary to the validity of all arguments based on experience,\\r\\nis itself not capable of being proved by experience, and yet is\\r\\nunhesitatingly believed by every one, at least in all its concrete\\r\\napplications. in these characteristics the principle of induction does\\r\\nnot stand alone. there are a number of other principles which cannot be\\r\\nproved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start\\r\\nfrom what is experienced.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome of these principles have even greater evidence than the principle\\r\\nof induction, and the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty\\r\\nas the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. they constitute the\\r\\nmeans of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation; and if what\\r\\nwe infer is to be true, it is just as necessary that our principles\\r\\nof inference should be true as it is that our data should be true. the\\r\\nprinciples of inference are apt to be overlooked because of their\\r\\nvery obviousness--the assumption involved is assented to without our\\r\\nrealizing that it is an assumption. but it is very important to realize\\r\\nthe use of principles of inference, if a correct theory of knowledge\\r\\nis to be obtained; for our knowledge of them raises interesting and\\r\\ndifficult questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nin all our knowledge of general principles, what actually happens\\r\\nis that first of all we realize some particular application of the\\r\\nprinciple, and then we realize that the particularity is irrelevant, and\\r\\nthat there is a generality which may equally truly be affirmed. this is\\r\\nof course familiar in such matters as teaching arithmetic: \\'two and\\r\\ntwo are four\\' is first learnt in the case of some particular pair of\\r\\ncouples, and then in some other particular case, and so on, until at\\r\\nlast it becomes possible to see that it is true of any pair of couples.\\r\\nthe same thing happens with logical principles. suppose two men are\\r\\ndiscussing what day of the month it is. one of them says, \\'at least you\\r\\nwill admit that _if_ yesterday was the 15th to-day must be the 16th.\\'\\r\\n\\'yes\\', says the other, \\'i admit that.\\' \\'and you know\\', the first\\r\\ncontinues, \\'that yesterday was the 15th, because you dined with jones,\\r\\nand your diary will tell you that was on the 15th.\\' \\'yes\\', says the\\r\\nsecond; \\'therefore to-day _is_ the 16th.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nnow such an argument is not hard to follow; and if it is granted that\\r\\nits premisses are true in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion\\r\\nmust also be true. but it depends for its truth upon an instance of a\\r\\ngeneral logical principle. the logical principle is as follows: \\'suppose\\r\\nit known that _if_ this is true, then that is true. suppose it also\\r\\nknown that this _is_ true, then it follows that that is true.\\' when it\\r\\nis the case that if this is true, that is true, we shall say that this\\r\\n\\'implies\\' that, and that that \\'follows from\\' this. thus our principle\\r\\nstates that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true.\\r\\nin other words, \\'anything implied by a true proposition is true\\', or\\r\\n\\'whatever follows from a true proposition is true\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis principle is really involved--at least, concrete instances of it\\r\\nare involved--in all demonstrations. whenever one thing which we believe\\r\\nis used to prove something else, which we consequently believe, this\\r\\nprinciple is relevant. if any one asks: \\'why should i accept the results\\r\\nof valid arguments based on true premisses?\\' we can only answer by\\r\\nappealing to our principle. in fact, the truth of the principle is\\r\\nimpossible to doubt, and its obviousness is so great that at first sight\\r\\nit seems almost trivial. such principles, however, are not trivial to\\r\\nthe philosopher, for they show that we may have indubitable knowledge\\r\\nwhich is in no way derived from objects of sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident\\r\\nlogical principles. some at least of these principles must be granted\\r\\nbefore any argument or proof becomes possible. when some of them have\\r\\nbeen granted, others can be proved, though these others, so long as they\\r\\nare simple, are just as obvious as the principles taken for granted. for\\r\\nno very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by\\r\\ntradition under the name of \\'laws of thought\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nthey are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) _the law of identity_: \\'whatever is, is.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) _the law of contradiction_: \\'nothing can both be and not be.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) _the law of excluded middle_: \\'everything must either be or not be.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nthese three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but\\r\\nare not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other\\r\\nsimilar principles: for instance, the one we considered just now, which\\r\\nstates that what follows from a true premiss is true. the name \\'laws of\\r\\nthought\\' is also misleading, for what is important is not the fact that\\r\\nwe think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave\\r\\nin accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in\\r\\naccordance with them we think _truly_. but this is a large question, to\\r\\nwhich we must return at a later stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition to the logical principles which enable us to prove from\\r\\na given premiss that something is _certainly_ true, there are other\\r\\nlogical principles which enable us to prove, from a given premiss,\\r\\nthat there is a greater or less probability that something is true. an\\r\\nexample of such principles--perhaps the most important example is the\\r\\ninductive principle, which we considered in the preceding chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\none of the great historic controversies in philosophy is the controversy\\r\\nbetween the two schools called respectively \\'empiricists\\' and\\r\\n\\'rationalists\\'. the empiricists--who are best represented by the\\r\\nbritish philosophers, locke, berkeley, and hume--maintained that all\\r\\nour knowledge is derived from experience; the rationalists--who are\\r\\nrepresented by the continental philosophers of the seventeenth century,\\r\\nespecially descartes and leibniz--maintained that, in addition to what\\r\\nwe know by experience, there are certain \\'innate ideas\\' and \\'innate\\r\\nprinciples\\', which we know independently of experience. it has now\\r\\nbecome possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or\\r\\nfalsehood of these opposing schools. it must be admitted, for the\\r\\nreasons already stated, that logical principles are known to us, and\\r\\ncannot be themselves proved by experience, since all proof presupposes\\r\\nthem. in this, therefore, which was the most important point of the\\r\\ncontroversy, the rationalists were in the right.\\r\\n\\r\\non the other hand, even that part of our knowledge which is _logically_\\r\\nindependent of experience (in the sense that experience cannot prove\\r\\nit) is yet elicited and caused by experience. it is on occasion of\\r\\nparticular experiences that we become aware of the general laws which\\r\\ntheir connexions exemplify. it would certainly be absurd to suppose that\\r\\nthere are innate principles in the sense that babies are born with a\\r\\nknowledge of everything which men know and which cannot be deduced from\\r\\nwhat is experienced. for this reason, the word \\'innate\\' would not now be\\r\\nemployed to describe our knowledge of logical principles. the phrase\\r\\n\\'_a priori_\\' is less objectionable, and is more usual in modern writers.\\r\\nthus, while admitting that all knowledge is elicited and caused by\\r\\nexperience, we shall nevertheless hold that some knowledge is _a\\r\\npriori_, in the sense that the experience which makes us think of it\\r\\ndoes not suffice to prove it, but merely so directs our attention that\\r\\nwe see its truth without requiring any proof from experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is another point of great importance, in which the empiricists\\r\\nwere in the right as against the rationalists. nothing can be known to\\r\\n_exist_ except by the help of experience. that is to say, if we wish to\\r\\nprove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we\\r\\nmust have among our premisses the existence of one or more things of\\r\\nwhich we have direct experience. our belief that the emperor of china\\r\\nexists, for example, rests upon testimony, and testimony consists,\\r\\nin the last analysis, of sense-data seen or heard in reading or being\\r\\nspoken to. rationalists believed that, from general consideration as\\r\\nto what must be, they could deduce the existence of this or that in the\\r\\nactual world. in this belief they seem to have been mistaken. all the\\r\\nknowledge that we can acquire _a priori_ concerning existence seems\\r\\nto be hypothetical: it tells us that if one thing exists, another must\\r\\nexist, or, more generally, that if one proposition is true, another must\\r\\nbe true. this is exemplified by the principles we have already dealt\\r\\nwith, such as \\'_if_ this is true, and this implies that, then that is\\r\\ntrue\\', or \\'_if_ this and that have been repeatedly found connected, they\\r\\nwill probably be connected in the next instance in which one of them is\\r\\nfound\\'. thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly\\r\\nlimited. all knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent\\r\\non experience. when anything is known immediately, its existence is\\r\\nknown by experience alone; when anything is proved to exist, without\\r\\nbeing known immediately, both experience and _a priori_ principles must\\r\\nbe required in the proof. knowledge is called _empirical_ when it rests\\r\\nwholly or partly upon experience. thus all knowledge which asserts\\r\\nexistence is empirical, and the only _a priori_ knowledge concerning\\r\\nexistence is hypothetical, giving connexions among things that exist or\\r\\nmay exist, but not giving actual existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n_a priori_ knowledge is not all of the logical kind we have been\\r\\nhitherto considering. perhaps the most important example of non-logical\\r\\n_a priori_ knowledge is knowledge as to ethical value. i am not speaking\\r\\nof judgements as to what is useful or as to what is virtuous, for such\\r\\njudgements do require empirical premisses; i am speaking of judgements\\r\\nas to the intrinsic desirability of things. if something is useful, it\\r\\nmust be useful because it secures some end; the end must, if we have\\r\\ngone far enough, be valuable on its own account, and not merely because\\r\\nit is useful for some further end. thus all judgements as to what is\\r\\nuseful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe judge, for example, that happiness is more desirable than misery,\\r\\nknowledge than ignorance, goodwill than hatred, and so on. such\\r\\njudgements must, in part at least, be immediate and _a priori_. like our\\r\\nprevious _a priori_ judgements, they may be elicited by experience, and\\r\\nindeed they must be; for it seems not possible to judge whether anything\\r\\nis intrinsically valuable unless we have experienced something of\\r\\nthe same kind. but it is fairly obvious that they cannot be proved by\\r\\nexperience; for the fact that a thing exists or does not exist cannot\\r\\nprove either that it is good that it should exist or that it is bad. the\\r\\npursuit of this subject belongs to ethics, where the impossibility of\\r\\ndeducing what ought to be from what is has to be established. in the\\r\\npresent connexion, it is only important to realize that knowledge as to\\r\\nwhat is intrinsically of value is _a priori_ in the same sense in\\r\\nwhich logic is _a priori_, namely in the sense that the truth of such\\r\\nknowledge can be neither proved nor disproved by experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nall pure mathematics is _a priori_, like logic. this was strenuously\\r\\ndenied by the empirical philosophers, who maintained that experience was\\r\\nas much the source of our knowledge of arithmetic as of our knowledge of\\r\\ngeography. they maintained that by the repeated experience of seeing two\\r\\nthings and two other things, and finding that altogether they made four\\r\\nthings, we were led by induction to the conclusion that two things\\r\\nand two other things would _always_ make four things altogether. if,\\r\\nhowever, this were the source of our knowledge that two and two are\\r\\nfour, we should proceed differently, in persuading ourselves of its\\r\\ntruth, from the way in which we do actually proceed. in fact, a certain\\r\\nnumber of instances are needed to make us think of two abstractly,\\r\\nrather than of two coins or two books or two people, or two of any other\\r\\nspecified kind. but as soon as we are able to divest our thoughts of\\r\\nirrelevant particularity, we become able to see the general principle\\r\\nthat two and two are four; any one instance is seen to be _typical_, and\\r\\nthe examination of other instances becomes unnecessary.(1)\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) cf. a. n. whitehead, _introduction to mathematics_ (home university\\r\\nlibrary).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe same thing is exemplified in geometry. if we want to prove some\\r\\nproperty of _all_ triangles, we draw some one triangle and reason about\\r\\nit; but we can avoid making use of any property which it does not share\\r\\nwith all other triangles, and thus, from our particular case, we obtain\\r\\na general result. we do not, in fact, feel our certainty that two and\\r\\ntwo are four increased by fresh instances, because, as soon as we have\\r\\nseen the truth of this proposition, our certainty becomes so great as\\r\\nto be incapable of growing greater. moreover, we feel some quality of\\r\\nnecessity about the proposition \\'two and two are four\\', which is\\r\\nabsent from even the best attested empirical generalizations. such\\r\\ngeneralizations always remain mere facts: we feel that there might be a\\r\\nworld in which they were false, though in the actual world they happen\\r\\nto be true. in any possible world, on the contrary, we feel that two\\r\\nand two would be four: this is not a mere fact, but a necessity to which\\r\\neverything actual and possible must conform.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe case may be made clearer by considering a genuinely-empirical\\r\\ngeneralization, such as \\'all men are mortal.\\' it is plain that we\\r\\nbelieve this proposition, in the first place, because there is no known\\r\\ninstance of men living beyond a certain age, and in the second place\\r\\nbecause there seem to be physiological grounds for thinking that an\\r\\norganism such as a man\\'s body must sooner or later wear out. neglecting\\r\\nthe second ground, and considering merely our experience of men\\'s\\r\\nmortality, it is plain that we should not be content with one quite\\r\\nclearly understood instance of a man dying, whereas, in the case of \\'two\\r\\nand two are four\\', one instance does suffice, when carefully considered,\\r\\nto persuade us that the same must happen in any other instance. also\\r\\nwe can be forced to admit, on reflection, that there may be some doubt,\\r\\nhowever slight, as to whether _all_ men are mortal. this may be made\\r\\nplain by the attempt to imagine two different worlds, in one of which\\r\\nthere are men who are not mortal, while in the other two and two make\\r\\nfive. when swift invites us to consider the race of struldbugs who never\\r\\ndie, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. but a world where two\\r\\nand two make five seems quite on a different level. we feel that such a\\r\\nworld, if there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge\\r\\nand reduce us to utter doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fact is that, in simple mathematical judgements such as \\'two and two\\r\\nare four\\', and also in many judgements of logic, we can know the general\\r\\nproposition without inferring it from instances, although some instance\\r\\nis usually necessary to make clear to us what the general proposition\\r\\nmeans. this is why there is real utility in the process of _deduction_,\\r\\nwhich goes from the general to the general, or from the general to the\\r\\nparticular, as well as in the process of _induction_, which goes from\\r\\nthe particular to the particular, or from the particular to the general.\\r\\nit is an old debate among philosophers whether deduction ever gives\\r\\n_new_ knowledge. we can now see that in certain cases, at least, it does\\r\\ndo so. if we already know that two and two always make four, and we\\r\\nknow that brown and jones are two, and so are robinson and smith, we can\\r\\ndeduce that brown and jones and robinson and smith are four. this is\\r\\nnew knowledge, not contained in our premisses, because the general\\r\\nproposition, \\'two and two are four\\', never told us there were such\\r\\npeople as brown and jones and robinson and smith, and the particular\\r\\npremisses do not tell us that there were four of them, whereas the\\r\\nparticular proposition deduced does tell us both these things.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the newness of the knowledge is much less certain if we take the\\r\\nstock instance of deduction that is always given in books on logic,\\r\\nnamely, \\'all men are mortal; socrates is a man, therefore socrates is\\r\\nmortal.\\' in this case, what we really know beyond reasonable doubt is\\r\\nthat certain men, a, b, c, were mortal, since, in fact, they have died.\\r\\nif socrates is one of these men, it is foolish to go the roundabout way\\r\\nthrough \\'all men are mortal\\' to arrive at the conclusion that _probably_\\r\\nsocrates is mortal. if socrates is not one of the men on whom our\\r\\ninduction is based, we shall still do better to argue straight from our\\r\\na, b, c, to socrates, than to go round by the general proposition, \\'all\\r\\nmen are mortal\\'. for the probability that socrates is mortal is greater,\\r\\non our data, than the probability that all men are mortal. (this is\\r\\nobvious, because if all men are mortal, so is socrates; but if socrates\\r\\nis mortal, it does not follow that all men are mortal.) hence we shall\\r\\nreach the conclusion that socrates is mortal with a greater approach to\\r\\ncertainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way\\r\\nof \\'all men are mortal\\' and then use deduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis illustrates the difference between general propositions known _a\\r\\npriori_ such as \\'two and two are four\\', and empirical generalizations\\r\\nsuch as \\'all men are mortal\\'. in regard to the former, deduction is the\\r\\nright mode of argument, whereas in regard to the latter, induction is\\r\\nalways theoretically preferable, and warrants a greater confidence in\\r\\nthe truth of our conclusion, because all empirical generalizations are\\r\\nmore uncertain than the instances of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have now seen that there are propositions known _a priori_, and that\\r\\namong them are the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well\\r\\nas the fundamental propositions of ethics. the question which must\\r\\nnext occupy us is this: how is it possible that there should be such\\r\\nknowledge? and more particularly, how can there be knowledge of general\\r\\npropositions in cases where we have not examined all the instances, and\\r\\nindeed never can examine them all, because their number is infinite?\\r\\nthese questions, which were first brought prominently forward by\\r\\nthe german philosopher kant (1724-1804), are very difficult, and\\r\\nhistorically very important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter viii. how _a priori_ knowledge is possible\\r\\n\\r\\nimmanuel kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern\\r\\nphilosophers. though he lived through the seven years war and the\\r\\nfrench revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at\\r\\nkoenigsberg in east prussia. his most distinctive contribution was the\\r\\ninvention of what he called the \\'critical\\' philosophy, which, assuming\\r\\nas a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such\\r\\nknowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this\\r\\ninquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world.\\r\\nwhether these results were valid may well be doubted. but kant\\r\\nundoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived\\r\\nthat we have _a priori_ knowledge which is not purely \\'analytic\\', i.e.\\r\\nsuch that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly,\\r\\nfor having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore the time of kant, it was generally held that whatever knowledge\\r\\nwas _a priori_ must be \\'analytic\\'. what this word means will be best\\r\\nillustrated by examples. if i say, \\'a bald man is a man\\', \\'a plane\\r\\nfigure is a figure\\', \\'a bad poet is a poet\\', i make a purely analytic\\r\\njudgement: the subject spoken about is given as having at least two\\r\\nproperties, of which one is singled out to be asserted of it. such\\r\\npropositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated\\r\\nin real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of\\r\\nsophistry. they are called \\'analytic\\' because the predicate is obtained\\r\\nby merely analysing the subject. before the time of kant it was thought\\r\\nthat all judgements of which we could be certain _a priori_ were of this\\r\\nkind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part\\r\\nof the subject of which it was asserted. if this were so, we should be\\r\\ninvolved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything\\r\\nthat could be known _a priori_. \\'a bald man is not bald\\' would assert\\r\\nand deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict\\r\\nitself. thus according to the philosophers before kant, the law of\\r\\ncontradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and\\r\\nnot have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all _a\\r\\npriori_ knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nhume (1711-76), who preceded kant, accepting the usual view as to what\\r\\nmakes knowledge _a priori_, discovered that, in many cases which had\\r\\npreviously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and\\r\\neffect, the connexion was really synthetic. before hume, rationalists at\\r\\nleast had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the\\r\\ncause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. hume argued--correctly, as\\r\\nwould now be generally admitted--that this could not be done. hence he\\r\\ninferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known\\r\\n_a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect. kant, who had been\\r\\neducated in the rationalist tradition, was much perturbed by hume\\'s\\r\\nscepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. he perceived that\\r\\nnot only the connexion of cause and effect, but all the propositions\\r\\nof arithmetic and geometry, are \\'synthetic\\', i.e. not analytic: in\\r\\nall these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the\\r\\npredicate. his stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. he pointed\\r\\nout, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the\\r\\nidea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them\\r\\ntogether. thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics,\\r\\nthough _a priori_, is synthetic; and this conclusion raised a new\\r\\nproblem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question which kant put at the beginning of his philosophy, namely\\r\\n\\'how is pure mathematics possible?\\' is an interesting and difficult one,\\r\\nto which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find\\r\\nsome answer. the answer of the pure empiricists, that our mathematical\\r\\nknowledge is derived by induction from particular instances, we have\\r\\nalready seen to be inadequate, for two reasons: first, that the validity\\r\\nof the inductive principle itself cannot be proved by induction;\\r\\nsecondly, that the general propositions of mathematics, such as \\'two\\r\\nand two always make four\\', can obviously be known with certainty by\\r\\nconsideration of a single instance, and gain nothing by enumeration of\\r\\nother cases in which they have been found to be true. thus our knowledge\\r\\nof the general propositions of mathematics (and the same applies to\\r\\nlogic) must be accounted for otherwise than our (merely probable)\\r\\nknowledge of empirical generalizations such as \\'all men are mortal\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem arises through the fact that such knowledge is general,\\r\\nwhereas all experience is particular. it seems strange that we should\\r\\napparently be able to know some truths in advance about particular\\r\\nthings of which we have as yet no experience; but it cannot easily be\\r\\ndoubted that logic and arithmetic will apply to such things. we do not\\r\\nknow who will be the inhabitants of london a hundred years hence; but\\r\\nwe know that any two of them and any other two of them will make four of\\r\\nthem. this apparent power of anticipating facts about things of which\\r\\nwe have no experience is certainly surprising. kant\\'s solution of the\\r\\nproblem, though not valid in my opinion, is interesting. it is, however,\\r\\nvery difficult, and is differently understood by different philosophers.\\r\\nwe can, therefore, only give the merest outline of it, and even that\\r\\nwill be thought misleading by many exponents of kant\\'s system.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat kant maintained was that in all our experience there are two\\r\\nelements to be distinguished, the one due to the object (i.e. to what we\\r\\nhave called the \\'physical object\\'), the other due to our own nature. we\\r\\nsaw, in discussing matter and sense-data, that the physical object is\\r\\ndifferent from the associated sense-data, and that the sense-data are to\\r\\nbe regarded as resulting from an interaction between the physical\\r\\nobject and ourselves. so far, we are in agreement with kant. but what\\r\\nis distinctive of kant is the way in which he apportions the shares of\\r\\nourselves and the physical object respectively. he considers that the\\r\\ncrude material given in sensation--the colour, hardness, etc.--is due\\r\\nto the object, and that what we supply is the arrangement in space\\r\\nand time, and all the relations between sense-data which result from\\r\\ncomparison or from considering one as the cause of the other or in any\\r\\nother way. his chief reason in favour of this view is that we seem\\r\\nto have _a priori_ knowledge as to space and time and causality and\\r\\ncomparison, but not as to the actual crude material of sensation. we can\\r\\nbe sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the\\r\\ncharacteristics affirmed of it in our _a priori_ knowledge, because\\r\\nthese characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore\\r\\nnothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these\\r\\ncharacteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe physical object, which he calls the \\'thing in itself\\',(1) he regards\\r\\nas essentially unknowable; what can be known is the object as we have it\\r\\nin experience, which he calls the \\'phenomenon\\'. the phenomenon, being\\r\\na joint product of us and the thing in itself, is sure to have those\\r\\ncharacteristics which are due to us, and is therefore sure to conform\\r\\nto our _a priori_ knowledge. hence this knowledge, though true of all\\r\\nactual and possible experience, must not be supposed to apply outside\\r\\nexperience. thus in spite of the existence of _a priori_ knowledge, we\\r\\ncannot know anything about the thing in itself or about what is not\\r\\nan actual or possible object of experience. in this way he tries to\\r\\nreconcile and harmonize the contentions of the rationalists with the\\r\\narguments of the empiricists.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) kant\\'s \\'thing in itself\\' is identical in _definition_ with\\r\\nthe physical object, namely, it is the cause of sensations. in the\\r\\nproperties deduced from the definition it is not identical, since kant\\r\\nheld (in spite of some inconsistency as regards cause) that we can know\\r\\nthat none of the categories are applicable to the \\'thing in itself\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\napart from minor grounds on which kant\\'s philosophy may be criticized,\\r\\nthere is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal\\r\\nwith the problem of _a priori_ knowledge by his method. the thing to\\r\\nbe accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to\\r\\nlogic and arithmetic. to say that logic and arithmetic are contributed\\r\\nby us does not account for this. our nature is as much a fact of the\\r\\nexisting world as anything, and there can be no certainty that it will\\r\\nremain constant. it might happen, if kant is right, that to-morrow\\r\\nour nature would so change as to make two and two become five. this\\r\\npossibility seems never to have occurred to him, yet it is one which\\r\\nutterly destroys the certainty and universality which he is anxious\\r\\nto vindicate for arithmetical propositions. it is true that this\\r\\npossibility, formally, is inconsistent with the kantian view that time\\r\\nitself is a form imposed by the subject upon phenomena, so that our\\r\\nreal self is not in time and has no to-morrow. but he will still have\\r\\nto suppose that the time-order of phenomena is determined by\\r\\ncharacteristics of what is behind phenomena, and this suffices for the\\r\\nsubstance of our argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nreflection, moreover, seems to make it clear that, if there is any truth\\r\\nin our arithmetical beliefs, they must apply to things equally whether\\r\\nwe think of them or not. two physical objects and two other physical\\r\\nobjects must make four physical objects, even if physical objects cannot\\r\\nbe experienced. to assert this is certainly within the scope of what\\r\\nwe mean when we state that two and two are four. its truth is just as\\r\\nindubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two\\r\\nother phenomena make four phenomena. thus kant\\'s solution unduly limits\\r\\nthe scope of _a priori_ propositions, in addition to failing in the\\r\\nattempt at explaining their certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\napart from the special doctrines advocated by kant, it is very common\\r\\namong philosophers to regard what is _a priori_ as in some sense mental,\\r\\nas concerned rather with the way we must think than with any fact of\\r\\nthe outer world. we noted in the preceding chapter the three principles\\r\\ncommonly called \\'laws of thought\\'. the view which led to their being so\\r\\nnamed is a natural one, but there are strong reasons for thinking\\r\\nthat it is erroneous. let us take as an illustration the law of\\r\\ncontradiction. this is commonly stated in the form \\'nothing can both be\\r\\nand not be\\', which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at\\r\\nonce have and not have a given quality. thus, for example, if a tree\\r\\nis a beech it cannot also be not a beech; if my table is rectangular it\\r\\ncannot also be not rectangular, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow what makes it natural to call this principle a law of _thought_\\r\\nis that it is by thought rather than by outward observation that we\\r\\npersuade ourselves of its necessary truth. when we have seen that a tree\\r\\nis a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether\\r\\nit is also not a beech; thought alone makes us know that this is\\r\\nimpossible. but the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law\\r\\nof _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous. what we believe, when we believe\\r\\nthe law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must\\r\\nbelieve the law of contradiction. _this_ belief is a subsequent result\\r\\nof psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of\\r\\ncontradiction. the belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about\\r\\nthings, not only about thoughts. it is not, e.g., the belief that if we\\r\\n_think_ a certain tree is a beech, we cannot at the same time _think_\\r\\nthat it is not a beech; it is the belief that if the tree _is_ a\\r\\nbeech, it cannot at the same time _be_ not a beech. thus the law of\\r\\ncontradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts; and\\r\\nalthough belief in the law of contradiction is a thought, the law of\\r\\ncontradiction itself is not a thought, but a fact concerning the things\\r\\nin the world. if this, which we believe when we believe the law of\\r\\ncontradiction, were not true of the things in the world, the fact\\r\\nthat we were compelled to _think_ it true would not save the law of\\r\\ncontradiction from being false; and this shows that the law is not a law\\r\\nof _thought_.\\r\\n\\r\\na similar argument applies to any other _a priori_ judgement. when we\\r\\njudge that two and two are four, we are not making a judgement about our\\r\\nthoughts, but about all actual or possible couples. the fact that our\\r\\nminds are so constituted as to believe that two and two are four, though\\r\\nit is true, is emphatically not what we assert when we assert that two\\r\\nand two are four. and no fact about the constitution of our minds could\\r\\nmake it _true_ that two and two are four. thus our _a priori_ knowledge,\\r\\nif it is not erroneous, is not merely knowledge about the constitution\\r\\nof our minds, but is applicable to whatever the world may contain, both\\r\\nwhat is mental and what is non-mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fact seems to be that all our _a priori_ knowledge is concerned with\\r\\nentities which do not, properly speaking, _exist_, either in the mental\\r\\nor in the physical world. these entities are such as can be named by\\r\\nparts of speech which are not substantives; they are such entities as\\r\\nqualities and relations. suppose, for instance, that i am in my room. i\\r\\nexist, and my room exists; but does \\'in\\' exist? yet obviously the word\\r\\n\\'in\\' has a meaning; it denotes a relation which holds between me and my\\r\\nroom. this relation is something, although we cannot say that it exists\\r\\n_in the same sense_ in which i and my room exist. the relation \\'in\\' is\\r\\nsomething which we can think about and understand, for, if we could not\\r\\nunderstand it, we could not understand the sentence \\'i am in my room\\'.\\r\\nmany philosophers, following kant, have maintained that relations are\\r\\nthe work of the mind, that things in themselves have no relations,\\r\\nbut that the mind brings them together in one act of thought and thus\\r\\nproduces the relations which it judges them to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis view, however, seems open to objections similar to those which we\\r\\nurged before against kant. it seems plain that it is not thought which\\r\\nproduces the truth of the proposition \\'i am in my room\\'. it may be true\\r\\nthat an earwig is in my room, even if neither i nor the earwig nor any\\r\\none else is aware of this truth; for this truth concerns only the earwig\\r\\nand the room, and does not depend upon anything else. thus relations, as\\r\\nwe shall see more fully in the next chapter, must be placed in a world\\r\\nwhich is neither mental nor physical. this world is of great importance\\r\\nto philosophy, and in particular to the problems of _a priori_\\r\\nknowledge. in the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature\\r\\nand its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter ix. the world of universals\\r\\n\\r\\nat the end of the preceding chapter we saw that such entities as\\r\\nrelations appear to have a being which is in some way different from\\r\\nthat of physical objects, and also different from that of minds and from\\r\\nthat of sense-data. in the present chapter we have to consider what is\\r\\nthe nature of this kind of being, and also what objects there are that\\r\\nhave this kind of being. we will begin with the latter question.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one, since it\\r\\nwas brought into philosophy by plato. plato\\'s \\'theory of ideas\\' is an\\r\\nattempt to solve this very problem, and in my opinion it is one of the\\r\\nmost successful attempts hitherto made. the theory to be advocated in\\r\\nwhat follows is largely plato\\'s, with merely such modifications as time\\r\\nhas shown to be necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe way the problem arose for plato was more or less as follows. let\\r\\nus consider, say, such a notion as _justice_. if we ask ourselves what\\r\\njustice is, it is natural to proceed by considering this, that, and the\\r\\nother just act, with a view to discovering what they have in common.\\r\\nthey must all, in some sense, partake of a common nature, which will be\\r\\nfound in whatever is just and in nothing else. this common nature, in\\r\\nvirtue of which they are all just, will be justice itself, the pure\\r\\nessence the admixture of which with facts of ordinary life produces the\\r\\nmultiplicity of just acts. similarly with any other word which may be\\r\\napplicable to common facts, such as \\'whiteness\\' for example. the word\\r\\nwill be applicable to a number of particular things because they all\\r\\nparticipate in a common nature or essence. this pure essence is what\\r\\nplato calls an \\'idea\\' or \\'form\\'. (it must not be supposed that \\'ideas\\',\\r\\nin his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.)\\r\\nthe \\'idea\\' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just: it is\\r\\nsomething other than particular things, which particular things partake\\r\\nof. not being particular, it cannot itself exist in the world of sense.\\r\\nmoreover it is not fleeting or changeable like the things of sense: it\\r\\nis eternally itself, immutable and indestructible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus plato is led to a supra-sensible world, more real than the common\\r\\nworld of sense, the unchangeable world of ideas, which alone gives to\\r\\nthe world of sense whatever pale reflection of reality may belong to it.\\r\\nthe truly real world, for plato, is the world of ideas; for whatever\\r\\nwe may attempt to say about things in the world of sense, we can only\\r\\nsucceed in saying that they participate in such and such ideas, which,\\r\\ntherefore, constitute all their character. hence it is easy to pass\\r\\non into a mysticism. we may hope, in a mystic illumination, to see the\\r\\nideas as we see objects of sense; and we may imagine that the ideas\\r\\nexist in heaven. these mystical developments are very natural, but the\\r\\nbasis of the theory is in logic, and it is as based in logic that we\\r\\nhave to consider it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe word \\'idea\\' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations\\r\\nwhich are quite misleading when applied to plato\\'s \\'ideas\\'. we shall\\r\\ntherefore use the word \\'universal\\' instead of the word \\'idea\\', to\\r\\ndescribe what plato meant. the essence of the sort of entity that plato\\r\\nmeant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in\\r\\nsensation. we speak of whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same\\r\\nnature as things given in sensation, as a _particular_; by opposition\\r\\nto this, a _universal_ will be anything which may be shared by many\\r\\nparticulars, and has those characteristics which, as we saw, distinguish\\r\\njustice and whiteness from just acts and white things.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we examine common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper\\r\\nnames stand for particulars, while other substantives, adjectives,\\r\\nprepositions, and verbs stand for universals. pronouns stand for\\r\\nparticulars, but are ambiguous: it is only by the context or the\\r\\ncircumstances that we know what particulars they stand for. the word\\r\\n\\'now\\' stands for a particular, namely the present moment; but like\\r\\npronouns, it stands for an ambiguous particular, because the present is\\r\\nalways changing.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one\\r\\nword which denotes a universal. the nearest approach would be some such\\r\\nstatement as \\'i like this\\'. but even here the word \\'like\\' denotes\\r\\na universal, for i may like other things, and other people may like\\r\\nthings. thus all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths\\r\\ninvolves acquaintance with universals.\\r\\n\\r\\nseeing that nearly all the words to be found in the dictionary stand\\r\\nfor universals, it is strange that hardly anybody except students of\\r\\nphilosophy ever realizes that there are such entities as universals. we\\r\\ndo not naturally dwell upon those words in a sentence which do not stand\\r\\nfor particulars; and if we are forced to dwell upon a word which stands\\r\\nfor a universal, we naturally think of it as standing for some one of\\r\\nthe particulars that come under the universal. when, for example, we\\r\\nhear the sentence, \\'charles i\\'s head was cut off\\', we may naturally\\r\\nenough think of charles i, of charles i\\'s head, and of the operation\\r\\nof cutting off _his_ head, which are all particulars; but we do not\\r\\nnaturally dwell upon what is meant by the word \\'head\\' or the word\\r\\n\\'cut\\', which is a universal: we feel such words to be incomplete and\\r\\ninsubstantial; they seem to demand a context before anything can be\\r\\ndone with them. hence we succeed in avoiding all notice of universals as\\r\\nsuch, until the study of philosophy forces them upon our attention.\\r\\n\\r\\neven among philosophers, we may say, broadly, that only those universals\\r\\nwhich are named by adjectives or substantives have been much or often\\r\\nrecognized, while those named by verbs and prepositions have been\\r\\nusually overlooked. this omission has had a very great effect upon\\r\\nphilosophy; it is hardly too much to say that most metaphysics, since\\r\\nspinoza, has been largely determined by it. the way this has occurred\\r\\nis, in outline, as follows: speaking generally, adjectives and common\\r\\nnouns express qualities or properties of single things, whereas\\r\\nprepositions and verbs tend to express relations between two or more\\r\\nthings. thus the neglect of prepositions and verbs led to the belief\\r\\nthat every proposition can be regarded as attributing a property to a\\r\\nsingle thing, rather than as expressing a relation between two or more\\r\\nthings. hence it was supposed that, ultimately, there can be no such\\r\\nentities as relations between things. hence either there can be only\\r\\none thing in the universe, or, if there are many things, they cannot\\r\\npossibly interact in any way, since any interaction would be a relation,\\r\\nand relations are impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first of these views, advocated by spinoza and held in our own day\\r\\nby bradley and many other philosophers, is called _monism_; the second,\\r\\nadvocated by leibniz but not very common nowadays, is called _monadism_,\\r\\nbecause each of the isolated things is called a _monad_. both these\\r\\nopposing philosophies, interesting as they are, result, in my opinion,\\r\\nfrom an undue attention to one sort of universals, namely the sort\\r\\nrepresented by adjectives and substantives rather than by verbs and\\r\\nprepositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nas a matter of fact, if any one were anxious to deny altogether that\\r\\nthere are such things as universals, we should find that we cannot\\r\\nstrictly prove that there are such entities as _qualities_, i.e. the\\r\\nuniversals represented by adjectives and substantives, whereas we\\r\\ncan prove that there must be _relations_, i.e. the sort of universals\\r\\ngenerally represented by verbs and prepositions. let us take in\\r\\nillustration the universal _whiteness_. if we believe that there is such\\r\\na universal, we shall say that things are white because they have the\\r\\nquality of whiteness. this view, however, was strenuously denied by\\r\\nberkeley and hume, who have been followed in this by later empiricists.\\r\\nthe form which their denial took was to deny that there are such things\\r\\nas \\'abstract ideas \\'. when we want to think of whiteness, they said, we\\r\\nform an image of some particular white thing, and reason concerning this\\r\\nparticular, taking care not to deduce anything concerning it which we\\r\\ncannot see to be equally true of any other white thing. as an account of\\r\\nour actual mental processes, this is no doubt largely true. in geometry,\\r\\nfor example, when we wish to prove something about all triangles, we\\r\\ndraw a particular triangle and reason about it, taking care not to use\\r\\nany characteristic which it does not share with other triangles. the\\r\\nbeginner, in order to avoid error, often finds it useful to draw several\\r\\ntriangles, as unlike each other as possible, in order to make sure that\\r\\nhis reasoning is equally applicable to all of them. but a difficulty\\r\\nemerges as soon as we ask ourselves how we know that a thing is white\\r\\nor a triangle. if we wish to avoid the universals _whiteness_ and\\r\\n_triangularity_, we shall choose some particular patch of white or some\\r\\nparticular triangle, and say that anything is white or a triangle if it\\r\\nhas the right sort of resemblance to our chosen particular. but then the\\r\\nresemblance required will have to be a universal. since there are many\\r\\nwhite things, the resemblance must hold between many pairs of particular\\r\\nwhite things; and this is the characteristic of a universal. it will be\\r\\nuseless to say that there is a different resemblance for each pair, for\\r\\nthen we shall have to say that these resemblances resemble each other,\\r\\nand thus at last we shall be forced to admit resemblance as a universal.\\r\\nthe relation of resemblance, therefore, must be a true universal. and\\r\\nhaving been forced to admit this universal, we find that it is no longer\\r\\nworth while to invent difficult and unplausible theories to avoid the\\r\\nadmission of such universals as whiteness and triangularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nberkeley and hume failed to perceive this refutation of their rejection\\r\\nof \\'abstract ideas\\', because, like their adversaries, they only thought\\r\\nof _qualities_, and altogether ignored _relations_ as universals. we\\r\\nhave therefore here another respect in which the rationalists appear to\\r\\nhave been in the right as against the empiricists, although, owing to\\r\\nthe neglect or denial of relations, the deductions made by rationalists\\r\\nwere, if anything, more apt to be mistaken than those made by\\r\\nempiricists.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now seen that there must be such entities as universals, the next\\r\\npoint to be proved is that their being is not merely mental. by this is\\r\\nmeant that whatever being belongs to them is independent of their being\\r\\nthought of or in any way apprehended by minds. we have already touched\\r\\non this subject at the end of the preceding chapter, but we must now\\r\\nconsider more fully what sort of being it is that belongs to universals.\\r\\n\\r\\nconsider such a proposition as \\'edinburgh is north of london\\'. here we\\r\\nhave a relation between two places, and it seems plain that the relation\\r\\nsubsists independently of our knowledge of it. when we come to know that\\r\\nedinburgh is north of london, we come to know something which has to\\r\\ndo only with edinburgh and london: we do not cause the truth of the\\r\\nproposition by coming to know it, on the contrary we merely apprehend a\\r\\nfact which was there before we knew it. the part of the earth\\'s surface\\r\\nwhere edinburgh stands would be north of the part where london stands,\\r\\neven if there were no human being to know about north and south, and\\r\\neven if there were no minds at all in the universe. this is, of course,\\r\\ndenied by many philosophers, either for berkeley\\'s reasons or for\\r\\nkant\\'s. but we have already considered these reasons, and decided that\\r\\nthey are inadequate. we may therefore now assume it to be true that\\r\\nnothing mental is presupposed in the fact that edinburgh is north of\\r\\nlondon. but this fact involves the relation \\'north of\\', which is a\\r\\nuniversal; and it would be impossible for the whole fact to involve\\r\\nnothing mental if the relation \\'north of\\', which is a constituent part\\r\\nof the fact, did involve anything mental. hence we must admit that the\\r\\nrelation, like the terms it relates, is not dependent upon thought, but\\r\\nbelongs to the independent world which thought apprehends but does not\\r\\ncreate.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis conclusion, however, is met by the difficulty that the relation\\r\\n\\'north of\\' does not seem to _exist_ in the same sense in which edinburgh\\r\\nand london exist. if we ask \\'where and when does this relation exist?\\'\\r\\nthe answer must be \\'nowhere and nowhen\\'. there is no place or time where\\r\\nwe can find the relation \\'north of\\'. it does not exist in edinburgh any\\r\\nmore than in london, for it relates the two and is neutral as between\\r\\nthem. nor can we say that it exists at any particular time. now\\r\\neverything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection\\r\\nexists at some particular time. hence the relation \\'north of\\' is\\r\\nradically different from such things. it is neither in space nor in\\r\\ntime, neither material nor mental; yet it is something.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is largely the very peculiar kind of being that belongs to universals\\r\\nwhich has led many people to suppose that they are really mental. we\\r\\ncan think _of_ a universal, and our thinking then exists in a perfectly\\r\\nordinary sense, like any other mental act. suppose, for example, that\\r\\nwe are thinking of whiteness. then _in one sense_ it may be said that\\r\\nwhiteness is \\'in our mind\\'. we have here the same ambiguity as we noted\\r\\nin discussing berkeley in chapter iv. in the strict sense, it is not\\r\\nwhiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. the\\r\\nconnected ambiguity in the word \\'idea\\', which we noted at the same time,\\r\\nalso causes confusion here. in one sense of this word, namely the sense\\r\\nin which it denotes the _object_ of an act of thought, whiteness is an\\r\\n\\'idea\\'. hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to\\r\\nthink that whiteness is an \\'idea\\' in the other sense, i.e. an act of\\r\\nthought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. but in so\\r\\nthinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality. one man\\'s\\r\\nact of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man\\'s; one\\r\\nman\\'s act of thought at one time is necessarily a different thing from\\r\\nthe same man\\'s act of thought at another time. hence, if whiteness were\\r\\nthe thought as opposed to its object, no two different men could think\\r\\nof it, and no one man could think of it twice. that which many different\\r\\nthoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_, and this object\\r\\nis different from all of them. thus universals are not thoughts, though\\r\\nwhen known they are the objects of thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shall find it convenient only to speak of things _existing_ when they\\r\\nare in time, that is to say, when we can point to some time at which\\r\\nthey exist (not excluding the possibility of their existing at all\\r\\ntimes). thus thoughts and feelings, minds and physical objects exist.\\r\\nbut universals do not exist in this sense; we shall say that they\\r\\n_subsist_ or _have being_, where \\'being\\' is opposed to \\'existence\\'\\r\\nas being timeless. the world of universals, therefore, may also be\\r\\ndescribed as the world of being. the world of being is unchangeable,\\r\\nrigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder\\r\\nof metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. the\\r\\nworld of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries,\\r\\nwithout any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and\\r\\nfeelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything\\r\\nthat can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to\\r\\nthe value of life and the world. according to our temperaments, we shall\\r\\nprefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. the one we do not\\r\\nprefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and\\r\\nhardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. but the truth is that\\r\\nboth have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real,\\r\\nand both are important to the metaphysician. indeed no sooner have we\\r\\ndistinguished the two worlds than it becomes necessary to consider their\\r\\nrelations.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut first of all we must examine our knowledge of universals. this\\r\\nconsideration will occupy us in the following chapter, where we shall\\r\\nfind that it solves the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, from which we\\r\\nwere first led to consider universals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter x. on our knowledge of universals\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to one man\\'s knowledge at a given time, universals, like\\r\\nparticulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those\\r\\nknown only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or\\r\\nby description.\\r\\n\\r\\nlet us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance. it is\\r\\nobvious, to begin with, that we are acquainted with such universals as\\r\\nwhite, red, black, sweet, sour, loud, hard, etc., i.e. with qualities\\r\\nwhich are exemplified in sense-data. when we see a white patch, we are\\r\\nacquainted, in the first instance, with the particular patch; but by\\r\\nseeing many white patches, we easily learn to abstract the whiteness\\r\\nwhich they all have in common, and in learning to do this we are\\r\\nlearning to be acquainted with whiteness. a similar process will make us\\r\\nacquainted with any other universal of the same sort. universals of this\\r\\nsort may be called \\'sensible qualities\\'. they can be apprehended with\\r\\nless effort of abstraction than any others, and they seem less removed\\r\\nfrom particulars than other universals are.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe come next to relations. the easiest relations to apprehend are those\\r\\nwhich hold between the different parts of a single complex sense-datum.\\r\\nfor example, i can see at a glance the whole of the page on which i\\r\\nam writing; thus the whole page is included in one sense-datum. but i\\r\\nperceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts,\\r\\nand some parts are above other parts. the process of abstraction in this\\r\\ncase seems to proceed somewhat as follows: i see successively a number\\r\\nof sense-data in which one part is to the left of another; i perceive,\\r\\nas in the case of different white patches, that all these sense-data\\r\\nhave something in common, and by abstraction i find that what they have\\r\\nin common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation\\r\\nwhich i call \\'being to the left of\\'. in this way i become acquainted\\r\\nwith the universal relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nin like manner i become aware of the relation of before and after in\\r\\ntime. suppose i hear a chime of bells: when the last bell of the chime\\r\\nsounds, i can retain the whole chime before my mind, and i can perceive\\r\\nthat the earlier bells came before the later ones. also in memory i\\r\\nperceive that what i am remembering came before the present time. from\\r\\neither of these sources i can abstract the universal relation of before\\r\\nand after, just as i abstracted the universal relation \\'being to the\\r\\nleft of\\'. thus time-relations, like space-relations, are among those\\r\\nwith which we are acquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is\\r\\nresemblance. if i see simultaneously two shades of green, i can see\\r\\nthat they resemble each other; if i also see a shade of red: at the same\\r\\ntime, i can see that the two greens have more resemblance to each other\\r\\nthan either has to the red. in this way i become acquainted with the\\r\\nuniversal _resemblance_ or _similarity_.\\r\\n\\r\\nbetween universals, as between particulars, there are relations of which\\r\\nwe may be immediately aware. we have just seen that we can perceive\\r\\nthat the resemblance between two shades of green is greater than the\\r\\nresemblance between a shade of red and a shade of green. here we are\\r\\ndealing with a relation, namely \\'greater than\\', between two relations.\\r\\nour knowledge of such relations, though it requires more power of\\r\\nabstraction than is required for perceiving the qualities of sense-data,\\r\\nappears to be equally immediate, and (at least in some cases) equally\\r\\nindubitable. thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as\\r\\nwell as concerning sense-data.\\r\\n\\r\\nreturning now to the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, which we left\\r\\nunsolved when we began the consideration of universals, we find\\r\\nourselves in a position to deal with it in a much more satisfactory\\r\\nmanner than was possible before. let us revert to the proposition \\'two\\r\\nand two are four\\'. it is fairly obvious, in view of what has been said,\\r\\nthat this proposition states a relation between the universal \\'two\\' and\\r\\nthe universal \\'four\\'. this suggests a proposition which we shall\\r\\nnow endeavour to establish: namely, _all _a priori_ knowledge deals\\r\\nexclusively with the relations of universals_. this proposition is\\r\\nof great importance, and goes a long way towards solving our previous\\r\\ndifficulties concerning _a priori_ knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only case in which it might seem, at first sight, as if our\\r\\nproposition were untrue, is the case in which an _a priori_ proposition\\r\\nstates that _all_ of one class of particulars belong to some other\\r\\nclass, or (what comes to the same thing) that _all_ particulars having\\r\\nsome one property also have some other. in this case it might seem\\r\\nas though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property\\r\\nrather than with the property. the proposition \\'two and two are four\\' is\\r\\nreally a case in point, for this may be stated in the form \\'any two\\r\\nand any other two are four\\', or \\'any collection formed of two twos is a\\r\\ncollection of four\\'. if we can show that such statements as this really\\r\\ndeal only with universals, our proposition may be regarded as proved.\\r\\n\\r\\none way of discovering what a proposition deals with is to ask ourselves\\r\\nwhat words we must understand--in other words, what objects we must be\\r\\nacquainted with--in order to see what the proposition means. as soon as\\r\\nwe see what the proposition means, even if we do not yet know whether\\r\\nit is true or false, it is evident that we must have acquaintance with\\r\\nwhatever is really dealt with by the proposition. by applying this test,\\r\\nit appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with\\r\\nparticulars are really concerned only with universals. in the special\\r\\ncase of \\'two and two are four\\', even when we interpret it as meaning\\r\\n\\'any collection formed of two twos is a collection of four\\', it is plain\\r\\nthat we can understand the proposition, i.e. we can see what it is that\\r\\nit asserts, as soon as we know what is meant by \\'collection\\' and \\'two\\'\\r\\nand \\'four\\'. it is quite unnecessary to know all the couples in the\\r\\nworld: if it were necessary, obviously we could never understand the\\r\\nproposition, since the couples are infinitely numerous and therefore\\r\\ncannot all be known to us. thus although our general statement _implies_\\r\\nstatements about particular couples, _as soon as we know that there are\\r\\nsuch particular couples_, yet it does not itself assert or imply that\\r\\nthere are such particular couples, and thus fails to make any statement\\r\\nwhatever about any actual particular couple. the statement made is about\\r\\n\\'couple\\', the universal, and not about this or that couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus the statement \\'two and two are four\\' deals exclusively with\\r\\nuniversals, and therefore may be known by anybody who is acquainted\\r\\nwith the universals concerned and can perceive the relation between them\\r\\nwhich the statement asserts. it must be taken as a fact, discovered\\r\\nby reflecting upon our knowledge, that we have the power of sometimes\\r\\nperceiving such relations between universals, and therefore of sometimes\\r\\nknowing general _a priori_ propositions such as those of arithmetic and\\r\\nlogic. the thing that seemed mysterious, when we formerly considered\\r\\nsuch knowledge, was that it seemed to anticipate and control experience.\\r\\nthis, however, we can now see to have been an error. _no_ fact\\r\\nconcerning anything capable of being experienced can be known\\r\\nindependently of experience. we know _a priori_ that two things and two\\r\\nother things together make four things, but we do _not_ know _a priori_\\r\\nthat if brown and jones are two, and robinson and smith are two, then\\r\\nbrown and jones and robinson and smith are four. the reason is that this\\r\\nproposition cannot be understood at all unless we know that there are\\r\\nsuch people as brown and jones and robinson and smith, and this we can\\r\\nonly know by experience. hence, although our general proposition is _a\\r\\npriori_, all its applications to actual particulars involve experience\\r\\nand therefore contain an empirical element. in this way what seemed\\r\\nmysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon\\r\\nan error.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will serve to make the point clearer if we contrast our genuine _a\\r\\npriori_ judgement with an empirical generalization, such as \\'all men are\\r\\nmortals\\'. here as before, we can _understand_ what the proposition\\r\\nmeans as soon as we understand the universals involved, namely _man_ and\\r\\n_mortal_. it is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance\\r\\nwith the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition\\r\\nmeans. thus the difference between an _a priori_ general proposition\\r\\nand an empirical generalization does not come in the _meaning_ of the\\r\\nproposition; it comes in the nature of the _evidence_ for it. in the\\r\\nempirical case, the evidence consists in the particular instances.\\r\\nwe believe that all men are mortal because we know that there are\\r\\ninnumerable instances of men dying, and no instances of their living\\r\\nbeyond a certain age. we do not believe it because we see a connexion\\r\\nbetween the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_. it is true that\\r\\nif physiology can prove, assuming the general laws that govern living\\r\\nbodies, that no living organism can last for ever, that gives a\\r\\nconnexion between _man_ and _mortality_ which would enable us to assert\\r\\nour proposition without appealing to the special evidence of _men_\\r\\ndying. but that only means that our generalization has been subsumed\\r\\nunder a wider generalization, for which the evidence is still of the\\r\\nsame kind, though more extensive. the progress of science is constantly\\r\\nproducing such subsumptions, and therefore giving a constantly wider\\r\\ninductive basis for scientific generalizations. but although this gives\\r\\na greater _degree_ of certainty, it does not give a different _kind_:\\r\\nthe ultimate ground remains inductive, i.e. derived from instances, and\\r\\nnot an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and\\r\\narithmetic.\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general\\r\\npropositions. the first is that, if many particular instances are known,\\r\\nour general proposition may be arrived at in the first instance by\\r\\ninduction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently\\r\\nperceived. for example, it is known that if we draw perpendiculars\\r\\nto the sides of a triangle from the opposite angles, all three\\r\\nperpendiculars meet in a point. it would be quite possible to be first\\r\\nled to this proposition by actually drawing perpendiculars in many\\r\\ncases, and finding that they always met in a point; this experience\\r\\nmight lead us to look for the general proof and find it. such cases are\\r\\ncommon in the experience of every mathematician.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe other point is more interesting, and of more philosophical\\r\\nimportance. it is, that we may sometimes know a general proposition in\\r\\ncases where we do not know a single instance of it. take such a case as\\r\\nthe following: we know that any two numbers can be multiplied together,\\r\\nand will give a third called their _product_. we know that all pairs\\r\\nof integers the product of which is less than 100 have been actually\\r\\nmultiplied together, and the value of the product recorded in the\\r\\nmultiplication table. but we also know that the number of integers is\\r\\ninfinite, and that only a finite number of pairs of integers ever have\\r\\nbeen or ever will be thought of by human beings. hence it follows that\\r\\nthere are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be\\r\\nthought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the\\r\\nproduct of which is over 100. hence we arrive at the proposition:\\r\\n\\'all products of two integers, which never have been and never will\\r\\nbe thought of by any human being, are over 100.\\' here is a general\\r\\nproposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from the very\\r\\nnature of the case, we can never give an instance; because any two\\r\\nnumbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis possibility, of knowledge of general propositions of which no\\r\\ninstance can be given, is often denied, because it is not perceived\\r\\nthat the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the\\r\\nrelations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances\\r\\nof the universals in question. yet the knowledge of such general\\r\\npropositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally\\r\\nadmitted to be known. for example, we saw, in our early chapters,\\r\\nthat knowledge of physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, is only\\r\\nobtained by an inference, and that they are not things with which we are\\r\\nacquainted. hence we can never know any proposition of the form \\'this\\r\\nis a physical object\\', where \\'this\\' is something immediately known. it\\r\\nfollows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that\\r\\nno actual instance can be given. we can give instances of the associated\\r\\nsense-data, but we cannot give instances of the actual physical objects.\\r\\nhence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this\\r\\npossibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given. and the\\r\\nsame applies to our knowledge of other people\\'s minds, or of any other\\r\\nclass of things of which no instance is known to us by acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge, as they have\\r\\nappeared in the course of our analysis. we have first to distinguish\\r\\nknowledge of things and knowledge of truths. in each there are two\\r\\nkinds, one immediate and one derivative. our immediate knowledge of\\r\\nthings, which we called _acquaintance_, consists of two sorts, according\\r\\nas the things known are particulars or universals. among particulars, we\\r\\nhave acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. among\\r\\nuniversals, there seems to be no principle by which we can decide which\\r\\ncan be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that\\r\\ncan be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time,\\r\\nsimilarity, and certain abstract logical universals. our derivative\\r\\nknowledge of things, which we call knowledge by _description_, always\\r\\ninvolves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths. our\\r\\nimmediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge,\\r\\nand the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths. among such\\r\\ntruths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and\\r\\nalso certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though\\r\\nwith less certainty) some ethical propositions. our _derivative_\\r\\nknowledge of truths consists of everything that we can deduce from\\r\\nself-evident truths by the use of self-evident principles of deduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nif the above account is correct, all our knowledge of truths depends\\r\\nupon our intuitive knowledge. it therefore becomes important to consider\\r\\nthe nature and scope of intuitive knowledge, in much the same way as,\\r\\nat an earlier stage, we considered the nature and scope of knowledge by\\r\\nacquaintance. but knowledge of truths raises a further problem, which\\r\\ndoes not arise in regard to knowledge of things, namely the problem of\\r\\n_error_. some of our beliefs turn out to be erroneous, and therefore\\r\\nit becomes necessary to consider how, if at all, we can distinguish\\r\\nknowledge from error. this problem does not arise with regard\\r\\nto knowledge by acquaintance, for, whatever may be the object of\\r\\nacquaintance, even in dreams and hallucinations, there is no error\\r\\ninvolved so long as we do not go beyond the immediate object: error can\\r\\nonly arise when we regard the immediate object, i.e. the sense-datum,\\r\\nas the mark of some physical object. thus the problems connected\\r\\nwith knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected\\r\\nwith knowledge of things. as the first of the problems connected\\r\\nwith knowledge of truths, let us examine the nature and scope of our\\r\\nintuitive judgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xi. on intuitive knowledge\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a common impression that everything that we believe ought to be\\r\\ncapable of proof, or at least of being shown to be highly probable. it\\r\\nis felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an\\r\\nunreasonable belief. in the main, this view is just. almost all our\\r\\ncommon beliefs are either inferred, or capable of being inferred, from\\r\\nother beliefs which may be regarded as giving the reason for them. as a\\r\\nrule, the reason has been forgotten, or has even never been consciously\\r\\npresent to our minds. few of us ever ask ourselves, for example, what\\r\\nreason there is to suppose the food we are just going to eat will not\\r\\nturn out to be poison. yet we feel, when challenged, that a perfectly\\r\\ngood reason could be found, even if we are not ready with it at the\\r\\nmoment. and in this belief we are usually justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut let us imagine some insistent socrates, who, whatever reason we\\r\\ngive him, continues to demand a reason for the reason. we must sooner\\r\\nor later, and probably before very long, be driven to a point where we\\r\\ncannot find any further reason, and where it becomes almost certain that\\r\\nno further reason is even theoretically discoverable. starting with the\\r\\ncommon beliefs of daily life, we can be driven back from point to point,\\r\\nuntil we come to some general principle, or some instance of a general\\r\\nprinciple, which seems luminously evident, and is not itself capable\\r\\nof being deduced from anything more evident. in most questions of\\r\\ndaily life, such as whether our food is likely to be nourishing and not\\r\\npoisonous, we shall be driven back to the inductive principle, which we\\r\\ndiscussed in chapter vi. but beyond that, there seems to be no further\\r\\nregress. the principle itself is constantly used in our reasoning,\\r\\nsometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously; but there is no\\r\\nreasoning which, starting from some simpler self-evident principle,\\r\\nleads us to the principle of induction as its conclusion. and the same\\r\\nholds for other logical principles. their truth is evident to us, and we\\r\\nemploy them in constructing demonstrations; but they themselves, or at\\r\\nleast some of them, are incapable of demonstration.\\r\\n\\r\\nself-evidence, however, is not confined to those among general\\r\\nprinciples which are incapable of proof. when a certain number of\\r\\nlogical principles have been admitted, the rest can be deduced from\\r\\nthem; but the propositions deduced are often just as self-evident as\\r\\nthose that were assumed without proof. all arithmetic, moreover, can\\r\\nbe deduced from the general principles of logic, yet the simple\\r\\npropositions of arithmetic, such as \\'two and two are four\\', are just as\\r\\nself-evident as the principles of logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem, also, though this is more disputable, that there are some\\r\\nself-evident ethical principles, such as \\'we ought to pursue what is\\r\\ngood\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nit should be observed that, in all cases of general principles,\\r\\nparticular instances, dealing with familiar things, are more evident\\r\\nthan the general principle. for example, the law of contradiction states\\r\\nthat nothing can both have a certain property and not have it. this is\\r\\nevident as soon as it is understood, but it is not so evident as that a\\r\\nparticular rose which we see cannot be both red and not red. (it is of\\r\\ncourse possible that parts of the rose may be red and parts not red, or\\r\\nthat the rose may be of a shade of pink which we hardly know whether to\\r\\ncall red or not; but in the former case it is plain that the rose as a\\r\\nwhole is not red, while in the latter case the answer is theoretically\\r\\ndefinite as soon as we have decided on a precise definition of \\'red\\'.)\\r\\nit is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to\\r\\nsee the general principle. only those who are practised in dealing with\\r\\nabstractions can readily grasp a general principle without the help of\\r\\ninstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition to general principles, the other kind of self-evident truths\\r\\nare those immediately derived from sensation. we will call such truths\\r\\n\\'truths of perception\\', and the judgements expressing them we will\\r\\ncall \\'judgements of perception\\'. but here a certain amount of care\\r\\nis required in getting at the precise nature of the truths that are\\r\\nself-evident. the actual sense-data are neither true nor false. a\\r\\nparticular patch of colour which i see, for example, simply exists: it\\r\\nis not the sort of thing that is true or false. it is true that there is\\r\\nsuch a patch, true that it has a certain shape and degree of brightness,\\r\\ntrue that it is surrounded by certain other colours. but the patch\\r\\nitself, like everything else in the world of sense, is of a radically\\r\\ndifferent kind from the things that are true or false, and therefore\\r\\ncannot properly be said to be _true_. thus whatever self-evident truths\\r\\nmay be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data\\r\\nfrom which they are obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem that there are two kinds of self-evident truths of\\r\\nperception, though perhaps in the last analysis the two kinds may\\r\\ncoalesce. first, there is the kind which simply asserts the _existence_\\r\\nof the sense-datum, without in any way analysing it. we see a patch\\r\\nof red, and we judge \\'there is such-and-such a patch of red\\', or more\\r\\nstrictly \\'there is that\\'; this is one kind of intuitive judgement of\\r\\nperception. the other kind arises when the object of sense is complex,\\r\\nand we subject it to some degree of analysis. if, for instance, we see a\\r\\n_round_ patch of red, we may judge \\'that patch of red is round\\'. this is\\r\\nagain a judgement of perception, but it differs from our previous kind.\\r\\nin our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour\\r\\nand shape: the colour is red and the shape is round. our judgement\\r\\nanalyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by\\r\\nstating that the red colour is round in shape. another example of this\\r\\nkind of judgement is \\'this is to the right of that\\', where \\'this\\'\\r\\nand \\'that\\' are seen simultaneously. in this kind of judgement the\\r\\nsense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each\\r\\nother, and the judgement asserts that these constituents have this\\r\\nrelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother class of intuitive judgements, analogous to those of sense and\\r\\nyet quite distinct from them, are judgements of _memory_. there is some\\r\\ndanger of confusion as to the nature of memory, owing to the fact that\\r\\nmemory of an object is apt to be accompanied by an image of the object,\\r\\nand yet the image cannot be what constitutes memory. this is easily seen\\r\\nby merely noticing that the image is in the present, whereas what is\\r\\nremembered is known to be in the past. moreover, we are certainly able\\r\\nto some extent to compare our image with the object remembered, so\\r\\nthat we often know, within somewhat wide limits, how far our image is\\r\\naccurate; but this would be impossible, unless the object, as opposed to\\r\\nthe image, were in some way before the mind. thus the essence of memory\\r\\nis not constituted by the image, but by having immediately before the\\r\\nmind an object which is recognized as past. but for the fact of memory\\r\\nin this sense, we should not know that there ever was a past at all,\\r\\nnor should we be able to understand the word \\'past\\', any more than a man\\r\\nborn blind can understand the word \\'light\\'. thus there must be intuitive\\r\\njudgements of memory, and it is upon them, ultimately, that all our\\r\\nknowledge of the past depends.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe case of memory, however, raises a difficulty, for it is notoriously\\r\\nfallacious, and thus throws doubt on the trustworthiness of intuitive\\r\\njudgements in general. this difficulty is no light one. but let us\\r\\nfirst narrow its scope as far as possible. broadly speaking, memory is\\r\\ntrustworthy in proportion to the vividness of the experience and to its\\r\\nnearness in time. if the house next door was struck by lightning half a\\r\\nminute ago, my memory of what i saw and heard will be so reliable that\\r\\nit would be preposterous to doubt whether there had been a flash at\\r\\nall. and the same applies to less vivid experiences, so long as they are\\r\\nrecent. i am absolutely certain that half a minute ago i was sitting in\\r\\nthe same chair in which i am sitting now. going backward over the day,\\r\\ni find things of which i am quite certain, other things of which i am\\r\\nalmost certain, other things of which i can become certain by thought\\r\\nand by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which i\\r\\nam by no means certain. i am quite certain that i ate my breakfast this\\r\\nmorning, but if i were as indifferent to my breakfast as a philosopher\\r\\nshould be, i should be doubtful. as to the conversation at breakfast,\\r\\ni can recall some of it easily, some with an effort, some only with a\\r\\nlarge element of doubt, and some not at all. thus there is a continual\\r\\ngradation in the degree of self-evidence of what i remember, and a\\r\\ncorresponding gradation in the trustworthiness of my memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus the first answer to the difficulty of fallacious memory is to say\\r\\nthat memory has degrees of self-evidence, and that these correspond\\r\\nto the degrees of its trustworthiness, reaching a limit of perfect\\r\\nself-evidence and perfect trustworthiness in our memory of events which\\r\\nare recent and vivid.\\r\\n\\r\\nit would seem, however, that there are cases of very firm belief in a\\r\\nmemory which is wholly false. it is probable that, in these cases, what\\r\\nis really remembered, in the sense of being immediately before the mind,\\r\\nis something other than what is falsely believed in, though something\\r\\ngenerally associated with it. george iv is said to have at last believed\\r\\nthat he was at the battle of waterloo, because he had so often said that\\r\\nhe was. in this case, what was immediately remembered was his repeated\\r\\nassertion; the belief in what he was asserting (if it existed) would\\r\\nbe produced by association with the remembered assertion, and would\\r\\ntherefore not be a genuine case of memory. it would seem that cases of\\r\\nfallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way, i.e. they\\r\\ncan be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all.\\r\\n\\r\\none important point about self-evidence is made clear by the case of\\r\\nmemory, and that is, that self-evidence has degrees: it is not a quality\\r\\nwhich is simply present or absent, but a quality which may be more or\\r\\nless present, in gradations ranging from absolute certainty down to an\\r\\nalmost imperceptible faintness. truths of perception and some of the\\r\\nprinciples of logic have the very highest degree of self-evidence;\\r\\ntruths of immediate memory have an almost equally high degree. the\\r\\ninductive principle has less self-evidence than some of the other\\r\\nprinciples of logic, such as \\'what follows from a true premiss must be\\r\\ntrue\\'. memories have a diminishing self-evidence as they become remoter\\r\\nand fainter; the truths of logic and mathematics have (broadly speaking)\\r\\nless self-evidence as they become more complicated. judgements of\\r\\nintrinsic ethical or aesthetic value are apt to have some self-evidence,\\r\\nbut not much.\\r\\n\\r\\ndegrees of self-evidence are important in the theory of knowledge,\\r\\nsince, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of\\r\\nself-evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon\\r\\nall connexion between self-evidence and truth, but merely to say that,\\r\\nwhere there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be\\r\\nretained and the less self-evident rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nit seems, however, highly probable that two different notions are\\r\\ncombined in \\'self-evidence\\' as above explained; that one of them,\\r\\nwhich corresponds to the highest degree of self-evidence, is really an\\r\\ninfallible guarantee of truth, while the other, which corresponds to\\r\\nall the other degrees, does not give an infallible guarantee, but only a\\r\\ngreater or less presumption. this, however, is only a suggestion, which\\r\\nwe cannot as yet develop further. after we have dealt with the nature\\r\\nof truth, we shall return to the subject of self-evidence, in connexion\\r\\nwith the distinction between knowledge and error.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xii. truth and falsehood\\r\\n\\r\\nour knowledge of truths, unlike our knowledge of things, has an\\r\\nopposite, namely _error_. so far as things are concerned, we may know\\r\\nthem or not know them, but there is no positive state of mind which can\\r\\nbe described as erroneous knowledge of things, so long, at any rate,\\r\\nas we confine ourselves to knowledge by acquaintance. whatever we are\\r\\nacquainted with must be something; we may draw wrong inferences from\\r\\nour acquaintance, but the acquaintance itself cannot be deceptive. thus\\r\\nthere is no dualism as regards acquaintance. but as regards knowledge of\\r\\ntruths, there is a dualism. we may believe what is false as well as\\r\\nwhat is true. we know that on very many subjects different people\\r\\nhold different and incompatible opinions: hence some beliefs must be\\r\\nerroneous. since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly\\r\\nas true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be\\r\\ndistinguished from true beliefs. how are we to know, in a given case,\\r\\nthat our belief is not erroneous? this is a question of the very\\r\\ngreatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is\\r\\npossible. there is, however, a preliminary question which is rather less\\r\\ndifficult, and that is: what do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood? it is\\r\\nthis preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter. in\\r\\nthis chapter we are not asking how we can know whether a belief is true\\r\\nor false: we are asking what is meant by the question whether a belief\\r\\nis true or false. it is to be hoped that a clear answer to this question\\r\\nmay help us to obtain an answer to the question what beliefs are\\r\\ntrue, but for the present we ask only \\'what is truth?\\' and \\'what is\\r\\nfalsehood?\\' not \\'what beliefs are true?\\' and \\'what beliefs are false?\\'\\r\\nit is very important to keep these different questions entirely\\r\\nseparate, since any confusion between them is sure to produce an answer\\r\\nwhich is not really applicable to either.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are three points to observe in the attempt to discover the nature\\r\\nof truth, three requisites which any theory must fulfil.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite,\\r\\nfalsehood. a good many philosophers have failed adequately to satisfy\\r\\nthis condition: they have constructed theories according to which all\\r\\nour thinking ought to have been true, and have then had the greatest\\r\\ndifficulty in finding a place for falsehood. in this respect our theory\\r\\nof belief must differ from our theory of acquaintance, since in the case\\r\\nof acquaintance it was not necessary to take account of any opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) it seems fairly evident that if there were no beliefs there could\\r\\nbe no falsehood, and no truth either, in the sense in which truth is\\r\\ncorrelative to falsehood. if we imagine a world of mere matter, there\\r\\nwould be no room for falsehood in such a world, and although it would\\r\\ncontain what may be called \\'facts\\', it would not contain any truths, in\\r\\nthe sense in which truths are things of the same kind as falsehoods.\\r\\nin fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements:\\r\\nhence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or\\r\\nstatements, would also contain no truth or falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) but, as against what we have just said, it is to be observed that\\r\\nthe truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which\\r\\nlies outside the belief itself. if i believe that charles i died on the\\r\\nscaffold, i believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my\\r\\nbelief, which could be discovered by merely examining the belief, but\\r\\nbecause of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries\\r\\nago. if i believe that charles i died in his bed, i believe falsely: no\\r\\ndegree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents\\r\\nit from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not\\r\\nbecause of any intrinsic property of my belief. hence, although truth\\r\\nand falsehood are properties of beliefs, they are properties dependent\\r\\nupon the relations of the beliefs to other things, not upon any internal\\r\\nquality of the beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe third of the above requisites leads us to adopt the view--which has\\r\\non the whole been commonest among philosophers--that truth consists in\\r\\nsome form of correspondence between belief and fact. it is, however, by\\r\\nno means an easy matter to discover a form of correspondence to which\\r\\nthere are no irrefutable objections. by this partly--and partly by the\\r\\nfeeling that, if truth consists in a correspondence of thought with\\r\\nsomething outside thought, thought can never know when truth has been\\r\\nattained--many philosophers have been led to try to find some definition\\r\\nof truth which shall not consist in relation to something wholly outside\\r\\nbelief. the most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the\\r\\ntheory that truth consists in _coherence_. it is said that the mark of\\r\\nfalsehood is failure to cohere in the body of our beliefs, and that it\\r\\nis the essence of a truth to form part of the completely rounded system\\r\\nwhich is the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great\\r\\ndifficulties. the first is that there is no reason to suppose that\\r\\nonly _one_ coherent body of beliefs is possible. it may be that, with\\r\\nsufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world\\r\\nthat would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different\\r\\nfrom the real past. in more scientific matters, it is certain that there\\r\\nare often two or more hypotheses which account for all the known facts\\r\\non some subject, and although, in such cases, men of science endeavour\\r\\nto find facts which will rule out all the hypotheses except one, there\\r\\nis no reason why they should always succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nin philosophy, again, it seems not uncommon for two rival hypotheses\\r\\nto be both able to account for all the facts. thus, for example, it is\\r\\npossible that life is one long dream, and that the outer world has only\\r\\nthat degree of reality that the objects of dreams have; but although\\r\\nsuch a view does not seem inconsistent with known facts, there is no\\r\\nreason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other\\r\\npeople and things do really exist. thus coherence as the definition\\r\\nof truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one\\r\\ncoherent system.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the\\r\\nmeaning of \\'coherence\\' known, whereas, in fact, \\'coherence\\' presupposes\\r\\nthe truth of the laws of logic. two propositions are coherent when both\\r\\nmay be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. now in\\r\\norder to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must\\r\\nknow such truths as the law of contradiction. for example, the two\\r\\npropositions, \\'this tree is a beech\\' and \\'this tree is not a beech\\',\\r\\nare not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. but if the law of\\r\\ncontradiction itself were subjected to the test of coherence, we should\\r\\nfind that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer\\r\\nbe incoherent with anything else. thus the laws of logic supply the\\r\\nskeleton or framework within which the test of coherence applies, and\\r\\nthey themselves cannot be established by this test.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor the above two reasons, coherence cannot be accepted as giving the\\r\\n_meaning_ of truth, though it is often a most important _test_ of truth\\r\\nafter a certain amount of truth has become known.\\r\\n\\r\\nhence we are driven back to _correspondence with fact_ as constituting\\r\\nthe nature of truth. it remains to define precisely what we mean by\\r\\n\\'fact\\', and what is the nature of the correspondence which must subsist\\r\\nbetween belief and fact, in order that belief may be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nin accordance with our three requisites, we have to seek a theory of\\r\\ntruth which (1) allows truth to have an opposite, namely falsehood, (2)\\r\\nmakes truth a property of beliefs, but (3) makes it a property wholly\\r\\ndependent upon the relation of the beliefs to outside things.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe necessity of allowing for falsehood makes it impossible to regard\\r\\nbelief as a relation of the mind to a single object, which could be said\\r\\nto be what is believed. if belief were so regarded, we should find that,\\r\\nlike acquaintance, it would not admit of the opposition of truth and\\r\\nfalsehood, but would have to be always true. this may be made clear\\r\\nby examples. othello believes falsely that desdemona loves cassio. we\\r\\ncannot say that this belief consists in a relation to a single object,\\r\\n\\'desdemona\\'s love for cassio\\', for if there were such an object, the\\r\\nbelief would be true. there is in fact no such object, and therefore\\r\\nothello cannot have any relation to such an object. hence his belief\\r\\ncannot possibly consist in a relation to this object.\\r\\n\\r\\nit might be said that his belief is a relation to a different object,\\r\\nnamely \\'that desdemona loves cassio\\'; but it is almost as difficult to\\r\\nsuppose that there is such an object as this, when desdemona does not\\r\\nlove cassio, as it was to suppose that there is \\'desdemona\\'s love for\\r\\ncassio\\'. hence it will be better to seek for a theory of belief which\\r\\ndoes not make it consist in a relation of the mind to a single object.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is common to think of relations as though they always held between\\r\\ntwo terms, but in fact this is not always the case. some relations\\r\\ndemand three terms, some four, and so on. take, for instance, the\\r\\nrelation \\'between\\'. so long as only two terms come in, the relation\\r\\n\\'between\\' is impossible: three terms are the smallest number that render\\r\\nit possible. york is between london and edinburgh; but if london and\\r\\nedinburgh were the only places in the world, there could be nothing\\r\\nwhich was between one place and another. similarly _jealousy_ requires\\r\\nthree people: there can be no such relation that does not involve three\\r\\nat least. such a proposition as \\'a wishes b to promote c\\'s marriage with\\r\\nd\\' involves a relation of four terms; that is to say, a and b and c and\\r\\nd all come in, and the relation involved cannot be expressed otherwise\\r\\nthan in a form involving all four. instances might be multiplied\\r\\nindefinitely, but enough has been said to show that there are relations\\r\\nwhich require more than two terms before they can occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe relation involved in _judging_ or _believing_ must, if falsehood is\\r\\nto be duly allowed for, be taken to be a relation between several terms,\\r\\nnot between two. when othello believes that desdemona loves cassio, he\\r\\nmust not have before his mind a single object, \\'desdemona\\'s love for\\r\\ncassio\\', or \\'that desdemona loves cassio \\', for that would require that\\r\\nthere should be objective falsehoods, which subsist independently of\\r\\nany minds; and this, though not logically refutable, is a theory to be\\r\\navoided if possible. thus it is easier to account for falsehood if\\r\\nwe take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various\\r\\nobjects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, desdemona and\\r\\nloving and cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when\\r\\nothello believes that desdemona loves cassio. this relation, therefore,\\r\\nis a relation of four terms, since othello also is one of the terms of\\r\\nthe relation. when we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do not\\r\\nmean that othello has a certain relation to desdemona, and has the same\\r\\nrelation to loving and also to cassio. this may be true of some other\\r\\nrelation than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which\\r\\nothello has to _each_ of the three terms concerned, but to _all_ of\\r\\nthem together: there is only one example of the relation of believing\\r\\ninvolved, but this one example knits together four terms. thus the\\r\\nactual occurrence, at the moment when othello is entertaining his\\r\\nbelief, is that the relation called \\'believing\\' is knitting together\\r\\ninto one complex whole the four terms othello, desdemona, loving, and\\r\\ncassio. what is called belief or judgement is nothing but this relation\\r\\nof believing or judging, which relates a mind to several things other\\r\\nthan itself. an _act_ of belief or of judgement is the occurrence\\r\\nbetween certain terms at some particular time, of the relation of\\r\\nbelieving or judging.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are now in a position to understand what it is that distinguishes a\\r\\ntrue judgement from a false one. for this purpose we will adopt certain\\r\\ndefinitions. in every act of judgement there is a mind which judges, and\\r\\nthere are terms concerning which it judges. we will call the mind the\\r\\n_subject_ in the judgement, and the remaining terms the _objects_. thus,\\r\\nwhen othello judges that desdemona loves cassio, othello is the subject,\\r\\nwhile the objects are desdemona and loving and cassio. the subject and\\r\\nthe objects together are called the _constituents_ of the judgement.\\r\\nit will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a\\r\\n\\'sense\\' or \\'direction\\'. we may say, metaphorically, that it puts its\\r\\nobjects in a certain _order_, which we may indicate by means of the\\r\\norder of the words in the sentence. (in an inflected language, the same\\r\\nthing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by the difference between\\r\\nnominative and accusative.) othello\\'s judgement that cassio loves\\r\\ndesdemona differs from his judgement that desdemona loves cassio, in\\r\\nspite of the fact that it consists of the same constituents, because the\\r\\nrelation of judging places the constituents in a different order in the\\r\\ntwo cases. similarly, if cassio judges that desdemona loves othello,\\r\\nthe constituents of the judgement are still the same, but their order is\\r\\ndifferent. this property of having a \\'sense\\' or \\'direction\\' is one which\\r\\nthe relation of judging shares with all other relations. the \\'sense\\'\\r\\nof relations is the ultimate source of order and series and a host of\\r\\nmathematical concepts; but we need not concern ourselves further with\\r\\nthis aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe spoke of the relation called \\'judging\\' or \\'believing\\' as knitting\\r\\ntogether into one complex whole the subject and the objects. in this\\r\\nrespect, judging is exactly like every other relation. whenever a\\r\\nrelation holds between two or more terms, it unites the terms into a\\r\\ncomplex whole. if othello loves desdemona, there is such a complex whole\\r\\nas \\'othello\\'s love for desdemona\\'. the terms united by the relation may\\r\\nbe themselves complex, or may be simple, but the whole which results\\r\\nfrom their being united must be complex. wherever there is a relation\\r\\nwhich relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of the\\r\\nunion of those terms; and conversely, wherever there is a complex\\r\\nobject, there is a relation which relates its constituents. when an act\\r\\nof believing occurs, there is a complex, in which \\'believing\\' is the\\r\\nuniting relation, and subject and objects are arranged in a certain\\r\\norder by the \\'sense\\' of the relation of believing. among the objects,\\r\\nas we saw in considering \\'othello believes that desdemona loves cassio\\',\\r\\none must be a relation--in this instance, the relation \\'loving\\'. but\\r\\nthis relation, as it occurs in the act of believing, is not the relation\\r\\nwhich creates the unity of the complex whole consisting of the subject\\r\\nand the objects. the relation \\'loving\\', as it occurs in the act of\\r\\nbelieving, is one of the objects--it is a brick in the structure, not\\r\\nthe cement. the cement is the relation \\'believing\\'. when the belief is\\r\\n_true_, there is another complex unity, in which the relation which was\\r\\none of the objects of the belief relates the other objects. thus, e.g.,\\r\\nif othello believes _truly_ that desdemona loves cassio, then there is\\r\\na complex unity, \\'desdemona\\'s love for cassio\\', which is composed\\r\\nexclusively of the _objects_ of the belief, in the same order as they\\r\\nhad in the belief, with the relation which was one of the objects\\r\\noccurring now as the cement that binds together the other objects of the\\r\\nbelief. on the other hand, when a belief is _false_, there is no such\\r\\ncomplex unity composed only of the objects of the belief. if othello\\r\\nbelieves _falsely_ that desdemona loves cassio, then there is no such\\r\\ncomplex unity as \\'desdemona\\'s love for cassio\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus a belief is _true_ when it _corresponds_ to a certain associated\\r\\ncomplex, and _false_ when it does not. assuming, for the sake of\\r\\ndefiniteness, that the objects of the belief are two terms and a\\r\\nrelation, the terms being put in a certain order by the \\'sense\\' of\\r\\nthe believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the\\r\\nrelation into a complex, the belief is true; if not, it is false. this\\r\\nconstitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search\\r\\nof. judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is\\r\\na constituent; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which\\r\\nthey have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the belief is true;\\r\\nif not, it is false.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, yet they\\r\\nare in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of\\r\\na belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind\\r\\nat all, but only the _objects_ of the belief. a mind, which believes,\\r\\nbelieves truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the\\r\\nmind, but only its objects. this correspondence ensures truth, and its\\r\\nabsence entails falsehood. hence we account simultaneously for the two\\r\\nfacts that beliefs (a) depend on minds for their _existence_, (b) do not\\r\\ndepend on minds for their _truth_.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may restate our theory as follows: if we take such a belief as\\r\\n\\'othello believes that desdemona loves cassio\\', we will call desdemona\\r\\nand cassio the _object-terms_, and loving the _object-relation_. if\\r\\nthere is a complex unity \\'desdemona\\'s love for cassio\\', consisting of\\r\\nthe object-terms related by the object-relation in the same order as\\r\\nthey have in the belief, then this complex unity is called the _fact\\r\\ncorresponding to the belief_. thus a belief is true when there is a\\r\\ncorresponding fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be seen that minds do not _create_ truth or falsehood. they\\r\\ncreate beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind cannot\\r\\nmake them true or false, except in the special case where they concern\\r\\nfuture things which are within the power of the person believing, such\\r\\nas catching trains. what makes a belief true is a _fact_, and this fact\\r\\ndoes not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of\\r\\nthe person who has the belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now decided what we _mean_ by truth and falsehood, we have next\\r\\nto consider what ways there are of knowing whether this or that belief\\r\\nis true or false. this consideration will occupy the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xiii. knowledge, error, and probable opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nthe question as to what we mean by truth and falsehood, which we\\r\\nconsidered in the preceding chapter, is of much less interest than the\\r\\nquestion as to how we can know what is true and what is false. this\\r\\nquestion will occupy us in the present chapter. there can be no doubt\\r\\nthat _some_ of our beliefs are erroneous; thus we are led to inquire\\r\\nwhat certainty we can ever have that such and such a belief is not\\r\\nerroneous. in other words, can we ever _know_ anything at all, or do we\\r\\nmerely sometimes by good luck believe what is true? before we can attack\\r\\nthis question, we must, however, first decide what we mean by \\'knowing\\',\\r\\nand this question is not so easy as might be supposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nat first sight we might imagine that knowledge could be defined as \\'true\\r\\nbelief\\'. when what we believe is true, it might be supposed that we had\\r\\nachieved a knowledge of what we believe. but this would not accord\\r\\nwith the way in which the word is commonly used. to take a very trivial\\r\\ninstance: if a man believes that the late prime minister\\'s last name\\r\\nbegan with a b, he believes what is true, since the late prime minister\\r\\nwas sir henry campbell bannerman. but if he believes that mr. balfour\\r\\nwas the late prime minister, he will still believe that the late prime\\r\\nminister\\'s last name began with a b, yet this belief, though true,\\r\\nwould not be thought to constitute knowledge. if a newspaper, by an\\r\\nintelligent anticipation, announces the result of a battle before any\\r\\ntelegram giving the result has been received, it may by good fortune\\r\\nannounce what afterwards turns out to be the right result, and it may\\r\\nproduce belief in some of its less experienced readers. but in spite of\\r\\nthe truth of their belief, they cannot be said to have knowledge. thus\\r\\nit is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from\\r\\na false belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nin like manner, a true belief cannot be called knowledge when it is\\r\\ndeduced by a fallacious process of reasoning, even if the premisses from\\r\\nwhich it is deduced are true. if i know that all greeks are men and that\\r\\nsocrates was a man, and i infer that socrates was a greek, i cannot be\\r\\nsaid to _know_ that socrates was a greek, because, although my premisses\\r\\nand my conclusion are true, the conclusion does not follow from the\\r\\npremisses.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly\\r\\ndeduced from true premisses? obviously we cannot say this. such a\\r\\ndefinition is at once too wide and too narrow. in the first place, it is\\r\\ntoo wide, because it is not enough that our premisses should be _true_,\\r\\nthey must also be _known_. the man who believes that mr. balfour was the\\r\\nlate prime minister may proceed to draw valid deductions from the true\\r\\npremiss that the late prime minister\\'s name began with a b, but he\\r\\ncannot be said to _know_ the conclusions reached by these deductions.\\r\\nthus we shall have to amend our definition by saying that knowledge\\r\\nis what is validly deduced from _known_ premisses. this, however, is a\\r\\ncircular definition: it assumes that we already know what is meant\\r\\nby \\'known premisses\\'. it can, therefore, at best define one sort\\r\\nof knowledge, the sort we call derivative, as opposed to intuitive\\r\\nknowledge. we may say: \\'_derivative_ knowledge is what is validly\\r\\ndeduced from premisses known intuitively\\'. in this statement there is\\r\\nno formal defect, but it leaves the definition of _intuitive_ knowledge\\r\\nstill to seek.\\r\\n\\r\\nleaving on one side, for the moment, the question of intuitive\\r\\nknowledge, let us consider the above suggested definition of derivative\\r\\nknowledge. the chief objection to it is that it unduly limits knowledge.\\r\\nit constantly happens that people entertain a true belief, which has\\r\\ngrown up in them because of some piece of intuitive knowledge from which\\r\\nit is capable of being validly inferred, but from which it has not, as a\\r\\nmatter of fact, been inferred by any logical process.\\r\\n\\r\\ntake, for example, the beliefs produced by reading. if the newspapers\\r\\nannounce the death of the king, we are fairly well justified in\\r\\nbelieving that the king is dead, since this is the sort of announcement\\r\\nwhich would not be made if it were false. and we are quite amply\\r\\njustified in believing that the newspaper asserts that the king is\\r\\ndead. but here the intuitive knowledge upon which our belief is based\\r\\nis knowledge of the existence of sense-data derived from looking at\\r\\nthe print which gives the news. this knowledge scarcely rises into\\r\\nconsciousness, except in a person who cannot read easily. a child may be\\r\\naware of the shapes of the letters, and pass gradually and painfully to\\r\\na realization of their meaning. but anybody accustomed to reading\\r\\npasses at once to what the letters mean, and is not aware, except on\\r\\nreflection, that he has derived this knowledge from the sense-data\\r\\ncalled seeing the printed letters. thus although a valid inference from\\r\\nthe-letters to their meaning is possible, and _could_ be performed\\r\\nby the reader, it is not in fact performed, since he does not in fact\\r\\nperform any operation which can be called logical inference. yet\\r\\nit would be absurd to say that the reader does not _know_ that the\\r\\nnewspaper announces the king\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe must, therefore, admit as derivative knowledge whatever is the result\\r\\nof intuitive knowledge even if by mere association, provided there _is_\\r\\na valid logical connexion, and the person in question could become aware\\r\\nof this connexion by reflection. there are in fact many ways, besides\\r\\nlogical inference, by which we pass from one belief to another: the\\r\\npassage from the print to its meaning illustrates these ways. these\\r\\nways may be called \\'psychological inference\\'. we shall, then, admit such\\r\\npsychological inference as a means of obtaining derivative knowledge,\\r\\nprovided there is a discoverable logical inference which runs parallel\\r\\nto the psychological inference. this renders our definition of\\r\\nderivative knowledge less precise than we could wish, since the word\\r\\n\\'discoverable\\' is vague: it does not tell us how much reflection may be\\r\\nneeded in order to make the discovery. but in fact \\'knowledge\\' is not a\\r\\nprecise conception: it merges into \\'probable opinion\\', as we shall\\r\\nsee more fully in the course of the present chapter. a very precise\\r\\ndefinition, therefore, should not be sought, since any such definition\\r\\nmust be more or less misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe chief difficulty in regard to knowledge, however, does not arise\\r\\nover derivative knowledge, but over intuitive knowledge. so long as we\\r\\nare dealing with derivative knowledge, we have the test of intuitive\\r\\nknowledge to fall back upon. but in regard to intuitive beliefs, it is\\r\\nby no means easy to discover any criterion by which to distinguish\\r\\nsome as true and others as erroneous. in this question it is scarcely\\r\\npossible to reach any very precise result: all our knowledge of truths\\r\\nis infected with some degree of doubt, and a theory which ignored this\\r\\nfact would be plainly wrong. something may be done, however, to mitigate\\r\\nthe difficulties of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nour theory of truth, to begin with, supplies the possibility of\\r\\ndistinguishing certain truths as _self-evident_ in a sense which ensures\\r\\ninfallibility. when a belief is true, we said, there is a corresponding\\r\\nfact, in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex.\\r\\nthe belief is said to constitute _knowledge_ of this fact, provided\\r\\nit fulfils those further somewhat vague conditions which we have been\\r\\nconsidering in the present chapter. but in regard to any fact, besides\\r\\nthe knowledge constituted by belief, we may also have the kind of\\r\\nknowledge constituted by _perception_ (taking this word in its widest\\r\\npossible sense). for example, if you know the hour of the sunset,\\r\\nyou can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting: this is\\r\\nknowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of _truths_; but you can also,\\r\\nif the weather is fine, look to the west and actually see the setting\\r\\nsun: you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of _things_.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus in regard to any complex fact, there are, theoretically, two ways\\r\\nin which it may be known: (1) by means of a judgement, in which its\\r\\nseveral parts are judged to be related as they are in fact related; (2)\\r\\nby means of _acquaintance_ with the complex fact itself, which may (in a\\r\\nlarge sense) be called perception, though it is by no means confined to\\r\\nobjects of the senses. now it will be observed that the second way of\\r\\nknowing a complex fact, the way of acquaintance, is only possible when\\r\\nthere really is such a fact, while the first way, like all judgement,\\r\\nis liable to error. the second way gives us the complex whole, and is\\r\\ntherefore only possible when its parts do actually have that relation\\r\\nwhich makes them combine to form such a complex. the first way, on the\\r\\ncontrary, gives us the parts and the relation severally, and demands\\r\\nonly the reality of the parts and the relation: the relation may not\\r\\nrelate those parts in that way, and yet the judgement may occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nit will be remembered that at the end of chapter xi we suggested that\\r\\nthere might be two kinds of self-evidence, one giving an absolute\\r\\nguarantee of truth, the other only a partial guarantee. these two kinds\\r\\ncan now be distinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe may say that a truth is self-evident, in the first and most absolute\\r\\nsense, when we have acquaintance with the fact which corresponds to\\r\\nthe truth. when othello believes that desdemona loves cassio, the\\r\\ncorresponding fact, if his belief were true, would be \\'desdemona\\'s\\r\\nlove for cassio\\'. this would be a fact with which no one could have\\r\\nacquaintance except desdemona; hence in the sense of self-evidence that\\r\\nwe are considering, the truth that desdemona loves cassio (if it were\\r\\na truth) could only be self-evident to desdemona. all mental facts, and\\r\\nall facts concerning sense-data, have this same privacy: there is only\\r\\none person to whom they can be self-evident in our present sense, since\\r\\nthere is only one person who can be acquainted with the mental things\\r\\nor the sense-data concerned. thus no fact about any particular existing\\r\\nthing can be self-evident to more than one person. on the other hand,\\r\\nfacts about universals do not have this privacy. many minds may be\\r\\nacquainted with the same universals; hence a relation between universals\\r\\nmay be known by acquaintance to many different people. in all cases\\r\\nwhere we know by acquaintance a complex fact consisting of certain terms\\r\\nin a certain relation, we say that the truth that these terms are so\\r\\nrelated has the first or absolute kind of self-evidence, and in these\\r\\ncases the judgement that the terms are so related _must_ be true. thus\\r\\nthis sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut although this sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of\\r\\ntruth, it does not enable us to be _absolutely_ certain, in the case of\\r\\nany given judgement, that the judgement in question is true. suppose\\r\\nwe first perceive the sun shining, which is a complex fact, and thence\\r\\nproceed to make the judgement \\'the sun is shining\\'. in passing from\\r\\nthe perception to the judgement, it is necessary to analyse the given\\r\\ncomplex fact: we have to separate out \\'the sun\\' and \\'shining\\' as\\r\\nconstituents of the fact. in this process it is possible to commit\\r\\nan error; hence even where a _fact_ has the first or absolute kind of\\r\\nself-evidence, a judgement believed to correspond to the fact is not\\r\\nabsolutely infallible, because it may not really correspond to the\\r\\nfact. but if it does correspond (in the sense explained in the preceding\\r\\nchapter), then it _must_ be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second sort of self-evidence will be that which belongs to\\r\\njudgements in the first instance, and is not derived from direct\\r\\nperception of a fact as a single complex whole. this second kind of\\r\\nself-evidence will have degrees, from the very highest degree down to a\\r\\nbare inclination in favour of the belief. take, for example, the case of\\r\\na horse trotting away from us along a hard road. at first our certainty\\r\\nthat we hear the hoofs is complete; gradually, if we listen intently,\\r\\nthere comes a moment when we think perhaps it was imagination or the\\r\\nblind upstairs or our own heartbeats; at last we become doubtful whether\\r\\nthere was any noise at all; then we _think_ we no longer hear anything,\\r\\nand at last we _know_ we no longer hear anything. in this process, there\\r\\nis a continual gradation of self-evidence, from the highest degree to\\r\\nthe least, not in the sense-data themselves, but in the judgements based\\r\\non them.\\r\\n\\r\\nor again: suppose we are comparing two shades of colour, one blue and\\r\\none green. we can be quite sure they are different shades of colour; but\\r\\nif the green colour is gradually altered to be more and more like the\\r\\nblue, becoming first a blue-green, then a greeny-blue, then blue,\\r\\nthere will come a moment when we are doubtful whether we can see any\\r\\ndifference, and then a moment when we know that we cannot see any\\r\\ndifference. the same thing happens in tuning a musical instrument, or in\\r\\nany other case where there is a continuous gradation. thus self-evidence\\r\\nof this sort is a matter of degree; and it seems plain that the higher\\r\\ndegrees are more to be trusted than the lower degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nin derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of\\r\\nself-evidence, and so must their connexion with the conclusions deduced\\r\\nfrom them. take for example a piece of reasoning in geometry. it is not\\r\\nenough that the axioms from which we start should be self-evident: it\\r\\nis necessary also that, at each step in the reasoning, the connexion of\\r\\npremiss and conclusion should be self-evident. in difficult reasoning,\\r\\nthis connexion has often only a very small degree of self-evidence;\\r\\nhence errors of reasoning are not improbable where the difficulty is\\r\\ngreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom what has been said it is evident that, both as regards intuitive\\r\\nknowledge and as regards derivative knowledge, if we assume that\\r\\nintuitive knowledge is trustworthy in proportion to the degree of its\\r\\nself-evidence, there will be a gradation in trustworthiness, from the\\r\\nexistence of noteworthy sense-data and the simpler truths of logic and\\r\\narithmetic, which may be taken as quite certain, down to judgements\\r\\nwhich seem only just more probable than their opposites. what we firmly\\r\\nbelieve, if it is true, is called _knowledge_, provided it is either\\r\\nintuitive or inferred (logically or psychologically) from intuitive\\r\\nknowledge from which it follows logically. what we firmly believe, if it\\r\\nis not true, is called _error_. what we firmly believe, if it is neither\\r\\nknowledge nor error, and also what we believe hesitatingly, because it\\r\\nis, or is derived from, something which has not the highest degree of\\r\\nself-evidence, may be called _probable opinion_. thus the greater\\r\\npart of what would commonly pass as knowledge is more or less probable\\r\\nopinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nin regard to probable opinion, we can derive great assistance from\\r\\n_coherence_, which we rejected as the _definition_ of truth, but may\\r\\noften use as a _criterion_. a body of individually probable opinions,\\r\\nif they are mutually coherent, become more probable than any one of them\\r\\nwould be individually. it is in this way that many scientific hypotheses\\r\\nacquire their probability. they fit into a coherent system of probable\\r\\nopinions, and thus become more probable than they would be in isolation.\\r\\nthe same thing applies to general philosophical hypotheses. often in a\\r\\nsingle case such hypotheses may seem highly doubtful, while yet, when\\r\\nwe consider the order and coherence which they introduce into a mass of\\r\\nprobable opinion, they become pretty nearly certain. this applies, in\\r\\nparticular, to such matters as the distinction between dreams and\\r\\nwaking life. if our dreams, night after night, were as coherent one with\\r\\nanother as our days, we should hardly know whether to believe the dreams\\r\\nor the waking life. as it is, the test of coherence condemns the\\r\\ndreams and confirms the waking life. but this test, though it increases\\r\\nprobability where it is successful, never gives absolute certainty,\\r\\nunless there is certainty already at some point in the coherent system.\\r\\nthus the mere organization of probable opinion will never, by itself,\\r\\ntransform it into indubitable knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xiv. the limits of philosophical knowledge\\r\\n\\r\\nin all that we have said hitherto concerning philosophy, we have\\r\\nscarcely touched on many matters that occupy a great space in the\\r\\nwritings of most philosophers. most philosophers--or, at any rate, very\\r\\nmany--profess to be able to prove, by _a priori_ metaphysical reasoning,\\r\\nsuch things as the fundamental dogmas of religion, the essential\\r\\nrationality of the universe, the illusoriness of matter, the unreality\\r\\nof all evil, and so on. there can be no doubt that the hope of finding\\r\\nreason to believe such theses as these has been the chief inspiration of\\r\\nmany life-long students of philosophy. this hope, i believe, is vain. it\\r\\nwould seem that knowledge concerning the universe as a whole is not to\\r\\nbe obtained by metaphysics, and that the proposed proofs that, in virtue\\r\\nof the laws of logic such and such things _must_ exist and such and such\\r\\nothers cannot, are not capable of surviving a critical scrutiny. in\\r\\nthis chapter we shall briefly consider the kind of way in which such\\r\\nreasoning is attempted, with a view to discovering whether we can hope\\r\\nthat it may be valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe great representative, in modern times, of the kind of view which\\r\\nwe wish to examine, was hegel (1770-1831). hegel\\'s philosophy is very\\r\\ndifficult, and commentators differ as to the true interpretation of it.\\r\\naccording to the interpretation i shall adopt, which is that of many, if\\r\\nnot most, of the commentators and has the merit of giving an interesting\\r\\nand important type of philosophy, his main thesis is that everything\\r\\nshort of the whole is obviously fragmentary, and obviously incapable of\\r\\nexisting without the complement supplied by the rest of the world. just\\r\\nas a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees what kind of animal\\r\\nthe whole must have been, so the metaphysician, according to hegel,\\r\\nsees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality must\\r\\nbe--at least in its large outlines. every apparently separate piece of\\r\\nreality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece;\\r\\nthe next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole\\r\\nuniverse is reconstructed. this essential incompleteness appears,\\r\\naccording to hegel, equally in the world of thought and in the world of\\r\\nthings. in the world of thought, if we take any idea which is\\r\\nabstract or incomplete, we find, on examination, that if we forget\\r\\nits incompleteness, we become involved in contradictions; these\\r\\ncontradictions turn the idea in question into its opposite, or\\r\\nantithesis; and in order to escape, we have to find a new, less\\r\\nincomplete idea, which is the synthesis of our original idea and its\\r\\nantithesis. this new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we\\r\\nstarted with, will be found, nevertheless, to be still not wholly\\r\\ncomplete, but to pass into its antithesis, with which it must be\\r\\ncombined in a new synthesis. in this way hegel advances until he reaches\\r\\nthe \\'absolute idea\\', which, according to him, has no incompleteness,\\r\\nno opposite, and no need of further development. the absolute idea,\\r\\ntherefore, is adequate to describe absolute reality; but all lower ideas\\r\\nonly describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is\\r\\nto one who simultaneously surveys the whole. thus hegel reaches the\\r\\nconclusion that absolute reality forms one single harmonious system, not\\r\\nin space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly\\r\\nspiritual. any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be\\r\\nproved logically--so he believes--to be entirely due to our fragmentary\\r\\npiecemeal view of the universe. if we saw the universe whole, as we may\\r\\nsuppose god sees it, space and time and matter and evil and all striving\\r\\nand struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eternal\\r\\nperfect unchanging spiritual unity.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to\\r\\nwhich we could wish to yield assent. nevertheless, when the arguments\\r\\nin support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much\\r\\nconfusion and many unwarrantable assumptions. the fundamental tenet\\r\\nupon which the system is built up is that what is incomplete must be not\\r\\nself-subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can\\r\\nexist. it is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself\\r\\nmust contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature,\\r\\nand could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not\\r\\nexist. a man\\'s nature, for example, is constituted by his memories and\\r\\nthe rest of his knowledge, by his loves and hatreds, and so on; thus,\\r\\nbut for the objects which he knows or loves or hates, he could not be\\r\\nwhat he is. he is essentially and obviously a fragment: taken as the\\r\\nsum-total of reality he would be self-contradictory.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis whole point of view, however, turns upon the notion of the \\'nature\\'\\r\\nof a thing, which seems to mean \\'all the truths about the thing\\'. it is\\r\\nof course the case that a truth which connects one thing with another\\r\\nthing could not subsist if the other thing did not subsist. but a\\r\\ntruth about a thing is not part of the thing itself, although it must,\\r\\naccording to the above usage, be part of the \\'nature\\' of the thing.\\r\\nif we mean by a thing\\'s \\'nature\\' all the truths about the thing, then\\r\\nplainly we cannot know a thing\\'s \\'nature\\' unless we know all the thing\\'s\\r\\nrelations to all the other things in the universe. but if the word\\r\\n\\'nature\\' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing\\r\\nmay be known when its \\'nature\\' is not known, or at any rate is not known\\r\\ncompletely. there is a confusion, when this use of the word \\'nature\\' is\\r\\nemployed, between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths. we may\\r\\nhave knowledge of a thing by acquaintance even if we know very few\\r\\npropositions about it--theoretically we need not know any propositions\\r\\nabout it. thus, acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of\\r\\nits \\'nature\\' in the above sense. and although acquaintance with a thing\\r\\nis involved in our knowing any one proposition about a thing, knowledge\\r\\nof its \\'nature\\', in the above sense, is not involved. hence, (1)\\r\\nacquaintance with a thing does not logically involve a knowledge of its\\r\\nrelations, and (2) a knowledge of some of its relations does not involve\\r\\na knowledge of all of its relations nor a knowledge of its \\'nature\\' in\\r\\nthe above sense. i may be acquainted, for example, with my toothache,\\r\\nand this knowledge may be as complete as knowledge by acquaintance ever\\r\\ncan be, without knowing all that the dentist (who is not acquainted\\r\\nwith it) can tell me about its cause, and without therefore knowing its\\r\\n\\'nature\\' in the above sense. thus the fact that a thing has relations\\r\\ndoes not prove that its relations are logically necessary. that is to\\r\\nsay, from the mere fact that it is the thing it is we cannot deduce\\r\\nthat it must have the various relations which in fact it has. this only\\r\\n_seems_ to follow because we know it already.\\r\\n\\r\\nit follows that we cannot prove that the universe as a whole forms a\\r\\nsingle harmonious system such as hegel believes that it forms. and if we\\r\\ncannot prove this, we also cannot prove the unreality of space and time\\r\\nand matter and evil, for this is deduced by hegel from the fragmentary\\r\\nand relational character of these things. thus we are left to the\\r\\npiecemeal investigation of the world, and are unable to know the\\r\\ncharacters of those parts of the universe that are remote from our\\r\\nexperience. this result, disappointing as it is to those whose hopes\\r\\nhave been raised by the systems of philosophers, is in harmony with\\r\\nthe inductive and scientific temper of our age, and is borne out by the\\r\\nwhole examination of human knowledge which has occupied our previous\\r\\nchapters.\\r\\n\\r\\nmost of the great ambitious attempts of metaphysicians have proceeded by\\r\\nthe attempt to prove that such and such apparent features of the actual\\r\\nworld were self-contradictory, and therefore could not be real. the\\r\\nwhole tendency of modern thought, however, is more and more in the\\r\\ndirection of showing that the supposed contradictions were illusory, and\\r\\nthat very little can be proved _a priori_ from considerations of what\\r\\n_must_ be. a good illustration of this is afforded by space and\\r\\ntime. space and time appear to be infinite in extent, and infinitely\\r\\ndivisible. if we travel along a straight line in either direction, it\\r\\nis difficult to believe that we shall finally reach a last point,\\r\\nbeyond which there is nothing, not even empty space. similarly, if in\\r\\nimagination we travel backwards or forwards in time, it is difficult to\\r\\nbelieve that we shall reach a first or last time, with not even empty\\r\\ntime beyond it. thus space and time appear to be infinite in extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nagain, if we take any two points on a line, it seems evident that there\\r\\nmust be other points between them however small the distance between\\r\\nthem may be: every distance can be halved, and the halves can be halved\\r\\nagain, and so on _ad infinitum_. in time, similarly, however little\\r\\ntime may elapse between two moments, it seems evident that there will be\\r\\nother moments between them. thus space and time appear to be infinitely\\r\\ndivisible. but as against these apparent facts--infinite extent and\\r\\ninfinite divisibility--philosophers have advanced arguments tending to\\r\\nshow that there could be no infinite collections of things, and that\\r\\ntherefore the number of points in space, or of instants in time, must\\r\\nbe finite. thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of\\r\\nspace and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.\\r\\n\\r\\nkant, who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility\\r\\nof space and time, which he declared to be merely subjective; and since\\r\\nhis time very many philosophers have believed that space and time are\\r\\nmere appearance, not characteristic of the world as it really is. now,\\r\\nhowever, owing to the labours of the mathematicians, notably georg\\r\\ncantor, it has appeared that the impossibility of infinite collections\\r\\nwas a mistake. they are not in fact self-contradictory, but only\\r\\ncontradictory of certain rather obstinate mental prejudices. hence the\\r\\nreasons for regarding space and time as unreal have become inoperative,\\r\\nand one of the great sources of metaphysical constructions is dried up.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mathematicians, however, have not been content with showing that\\r\\nspace as it is commonly supposed to be is possible; they have shown also\\r\\nthat many other forms of space are equally possible, so far as logic\\r\\ncan show. some of euclid\\'s axioms, which appear to common sense to be\\r\\nnecessary, and were formerly supposed to be necessary by philosophers,\\r\\nare now known to derive their appearance of necessity from our mere\\r\\nfamiliarity with actual space, and not from any _a priori_ logical\\r\\nfoundation. by imagining worlds in which these axioms are false, the\\r\\nmathematicians have used logic to loosen the prejudices of common\\r\\nsense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing--some more, some\\r\\nless--from that in which we live. and some of these spaces differ so\\r\\nlittle from euclidean space, where distances such as we can measure are\\r\\nconcerned, that it is impossible to discover by observation whether our\\r\\nactual space is strictly euclidean or of one of these other kinds.\\r\\nthus the position is completely reversed. formerly it appeared that\\r\\nexperience left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this\\r\\none kind to be impossible. now, logic presents many kinds of space as\\r\\npossible apart from experience, and experience only partially decides\\r\\nbetween them. thus, while our knowledge of what is has become less\\r\\nthan it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be is\\r\\nenormously increased. instead of being shut in within narrow walls, of\\r\\nwhich every nook and cranny could be explored, we find ourselves in an\\r\\nopen world of free possibilities, where much remains unknown because\\r\\nthere is so much to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat has happened in the case of space and time has happened, to some\\r\\nextent, in other directions as well. the attempt to prescribe to the\\r\\nuniverse by means of _a priori_ principles has broken down; logic,\\r\\ninstead of being, as formerly, the bar to possibilities, has become the\\r\\ngreat liberator of the imagination, presenting innumerable alternatives\\r\\nwhich are closed to unreflective common sense, and leaving to experience\\r\\nthe task of deciding, where decision is possible, between the many\\r\\nworlds which logic offers for our choice. thus knowledge as to what\\r\\nexists becomes limited to what we can learn from experience--not to\\r\\nwhat we can actually experience, for, as we have seen, there is much\\r\\nknowledge by description concerning things of which we have no direct\\r\\nexperience. but in all cases of knowledge by description, we need some\\r\\nconnexion of universals, enabling us, from such and such a datum, to\\r\\ninfer an object of a certain sort as implied by our datum. thus in\\r\\nregard to physical objects, for example, the principle that sense-data\\r\\nare signs of physical objects is itself a connexion of universals; and\\r\\nit is only in virtue of this principle that experience enables us to\\r\\nacquire knowledge concerning physical objects. the same applies to\\r\\nthe law of causality, or, to descend to what is less general, to such\\r\\nprinciples as the law of gravitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nprinciples such as the law of gravitation are proved, or rather are\\r\\nrendered highly probable, by a combination of experience with some\\r\\nwholly _a priori_ principle, such as the principle of induction. thus\\r\\nour intuitive knowledge, which is the source of all our other knowledge\\r\\nof truths, is of two sorts: pure empirical knowledge, which tells us of\\r\\nthe existence and some of the properties of particular things with\\r\\nwhich we are acquainted, and pure _a priori_ knowledge, which gives us\\r\\nconnexions between universals, and enables us to draw inferences from\\r\\nthe particular facts given in empirical knowledge. our derivative\\r\\nknowledge always depends upon some pure _a priori_ knowledge and usually\\r\\nalso depends upon some pure empirical knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophical knowledge, if what has been said above is true, does not\\r\\ndiffer essentially from scientific knowledge; there is no special\\r\\nsource of wisdom which is open to philosophy but not to science, and the\\r\\nresults obtained by philosophy are not radically different from those\\r\\nobtained from science. the essential characteristic of philosophy,\\r\\nwhich makes it a study distinct from science, is criticism. it examines\\r\\ncritically the principles employed in science and in daily life; it\\r\\nsearches out any inconsistencies there may be in these principles,\\r\\nand it only accepts them when, as the result of a critical inquiry, no\\r\\nreason for rejecting them has appeared. if, as many philosophers have\\r\\nbelieved, the principles underlying the sciences were capable, when\\r\\ndisengaged from irrelevant detail, of giving us knowledge concerning\\r\\nthe universe as a whole, such knowledge would have the same claim on our\\r\\nbelief as scientific knowledge has; but our inquiry has not revealed any\\r\\nsuch knowledge, and therefore, as regards the special doctrines of the\\r\\nbolder metaphysicians, has had a mainly negative result. but as regards\\r\\nwhat would be commonly accepted as knowledge, our result is in the main\\r\\npositive: we have seldom found reason to reject such knowledge as the\\r\\nresult of our criticism, and we have seen no reason to suppose man\\r\\nincapable of the kind of knowledge which he is generally believed to\\r\\npossess.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen, however, we speak of philosophy as a _criticism_ of knowledge, it\\r\\nis necessary to impose a certain limitation. if we adopt the attitude\\r\\nof the complete sceptic, placing ourselves wholly outside all knowledge,\\r\\nand asking, from this outside position, to be compelled to return within\\r\\nthe circle of knowledge, we are demanding what is impossible, and our\\r\\nscepticism can never be refuted. for all refutation must begin with\\r\\nsome piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt,\\r\\nno argument can begin. hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy\\r\\nemploys must not be of this destructive kind, if any result is to be\\r\\nachieved. against this absolute scepticism, no _logical_ argument can be\\r\\nadvanced. but it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind\\r\\nis unreasonable. descartes\\' \\'methodical doubt\\', with which modern\\r\\nphilosophy began, is not of this kind, but is rather the kind of\\r\\ncriticism which we are asserting to be the essence of philosophy. his\\r\\n\\'methodical doubt\\' consisted in doubting whatever seemed doubtful; in\\r\\npausing, with each apparent piece of knowledge, to ask himself whether,\\r\\non reflection, he could feel certain that he really knew it. this is the\\r\\nkind of criticism which constitutes philosophy. some knowledge, such as\\r\\nknowledge of the existence of our sense-data, appears quite indubitable,\\r\\nhowever calmly and thoroughly we reflect upon it. in regard to such\\r\\nknowledge, philosophical criticism does not require that we should\\r\\nabstain from belief. but there are beliefs--such, for example, as the\\r\\nbelief that physical objects exactly resemble our sense-data--which are\\r\\nentertained until we begin to reflect, but are found to melt away\\r\\nwhen subjected to a close inquiry. such beliefs philosophy will bid us\\r\\nreject, unless some new line of argument is found to support them.\\r\\nbut to reject the beliefs which do not appear open to any objections,\\r\\nhowever closely we examine them, is not reasonable, and is not what\\r\\nphilosophy advocates.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe criticism aimed at, in a word, is not that which, without reason,\\r\\ndetermines to reject, but that which considers each piece of apparent\\r\\nknowledge on its merits, and retains whatever still appears to be\\r\\nknowledge when this consideration is completed. that some risk of error\\r\\nremains must be admitted, since human beings are fallible. philosophy\\r\\nmay claim justly that it diminishes the risk of error, and that in some\\r\\ncases it renders the risk so small as to be practically negligible. to\\r\\ndo more than this is not possible in a world where mistakes must occur;\\r\\nand more than this no prudent advocate of philosophy would claim to have\\r\\nperformed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xv. the value of philosophy\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now come to the end of our brief and very incomplete review of\\r\\nthe problems of philosophy, it will be well to consider, in conclusion,\\r\\nwhat is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. it is\\r\\nthe more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that\\r\\nmany men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are\\r\\ninclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent\\r\\nbut useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on\\r\\nmatters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis view of philosophy appears to result, partly from a wrong\\r\\nconception of the ends of life, partly from a wrong conception of the\\r\\nkind of goods which philosophy strives to achieve. physical science,\\r\\nthrough the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who\\r\\nare wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to\\r\\nbe recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the\\r\\nstudent, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. thus\\r\\nutility does not belong to philosophy. if the study of philosophy has\\r\\nany value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only\\r\\nindirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it.\\r\\nit is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of\\r\\nphilosophy must be primarily sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut further, if we are not to fail in our endeavour to determine the\\r\\nvalue of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices\\r\\nof what are wrongly called \\'practical\\' men. the \\'practical\\' man, as\\r\\nthis word is often used, is one who recognizes only material needs, who\\r\\nrealizes that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the\\r\\nnecessity of providing food for the mind. if all men were well off, if\\r\\npoverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point,\\r\\nthere would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society;\\r\\nand even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as\\r\\nimportant as the goods of the body. it is exclusively among the goods of\\r\\nthe mind that the value of philosophy is to be found; and only those who\\r\\nare not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of\\r\\nphilosophy is not a waste of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nphilosophy, like all other studies, aims primarily at knowledge. the\\r\\nknowledge it aims at is the kind of knowledge which gives unity and\\r\\nsystem to the body of the sciences, and the kind which results from a\\r\\ncritical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and\\r\\nbeliefs. but it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very\\r\\ngreat measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to\\r\\nits questions. if you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian,\\r\\nor any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been\\r\\nascertained by his science, his answer will last as long as you are\\r\\nwilling to listen. but if you put the same question to a philosopher, he\\r\\nwill, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved\\r\\npositive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. it is\\r\\ntrue that this is partly accounted for by the fact that, as soon as\\r\\ndefinite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject\\r\\nceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science. the\\r\\nwhole study of the heavens, which now belongs to astronomy, was once\\r\\nincluded in philosophy; newton\\'s great work was called \\'the mathematical\\r\\nprinciples of natural philosophy\\'. similarly, the study of the human\\r\\nmind, which was a part of philosophy, has now been separated from\\r\\nphilosophy and has become the science of psychology. thus, to a great\\r\\nextent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more apparent than real: those\\r\\nquestions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in\\r\\nthe sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer\\r\\ncan be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is, however, only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of\\r\\nphilosophy. there are many questions--and among them those that are of\\r\\nthe profoundest interest to our spiritual life--which, so far as we\\r\\ncan see, must remain insoluble to the human intellect unless its powers\\r\\nbecome of quite a different order from what they are now. has the\\r\\nuniverse any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse\\r\\nof atoms? is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving\\r\\nhope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on\\r\\na small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible? are good\\r\\nand evil of importance to the universe or only to man? such questions\\r\\nare asked by philosophy, and variously answered by various philosophers.\\r\\nbut it would seem that, whether answers be otherwise discoverable or\\r\\nnot, the answers suggested by philosophy are none of them demonstrably\\r\\ntrue. yet, however slight may be the hope of discovering an answer, it\\r\\nis part of the business of philosophy to continue the consideration of\\r\\nsuch questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the\\r\\napproaches to them, and to keep alive that speculative interest in the\\r\\nuniverse which is apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely\\r\\nascertainable knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nmany philosophers, it is true, have held that philosophy could establish\\r\\nthe truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions. they have\\r\\nsupposed that what is of most importance in religious beliefs could be\\r\\nproved by strict demonstration to be true. in order to judge of such\\r\\nattempts, it is necessary to take a survey of human knowledge, and to\\r\\nform an opinion as to its methods and its limitations. on such a subject\\r\\nit would be unwise to pronounce dogmatically; but if the investigations\\r\\nof our previous chapters have not led us astray, we shall be compelled\\r\\nto renounce the hope of finding philosophical proofs of religious\\r\\nbeliefs. we cannot, therefore, include as part of the value of\\r\\nphilosophy any definite set of answers to such questions. hence, once\\r\\nmore, the value of philosophy must not depend upon any supposed body of\\r\\ndefinitely ascertainable knowledge to be acquired by those who study it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very\\r\\nuncertainty. the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through\\r\\nlife imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the\\r\\nhabitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which\\r\\nhave grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his\\r\\ndeliberate reason. to such a man the world tends to become definite,\\r\\nfinite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar\\r\\npossibilities are contemptuously rejected. as soon as we begin to\\r\\nphilosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening\\r\\nchapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which\\r\\nonly very incomplete answers can be given. philosophy, though unable to\\r\\ntell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it\\r\\nraises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts\\r\\nand free them from the tyranny of custom. thus, while diminishing our\\r\\nfeeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our\\r\\nknowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant\\r\\ndogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of\\r\\nliberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing\\r\\nfamiliar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\napart from its utility in showing unsuspected possibilities, philosophy\\r\\nhas a value--perhaps its chief value--through the greatness of the\\r\\nobjects which it contemplates, and the freedom from narrow and personal\\r\\naims resulting from this contemplation. the life of the instinctive\\r\\nman is shut up within the circle of his private interests: family and\\r\\nfriends may be included, but the outer world is not regarded except\\r\\nas it may help or hinder what comes within the circle of instinctive\\r\\nwishes. in such a life there is something feverish and confined, in\\r\\ncomparison with which the philosophic life is calm and free. the private\\r\\nworld of instinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a\\r\\ngreat and powerful world which must, sooner or later, lay our private\\r\\nworld in ruins. unless we can so enlarge our interests as to include the\\r\\nwhole outer world, we remain like a garrison in a beleagured fortress,\\r\\nknowing that the enemy prevents escape and that ultimate surrender is\\r\\ninevitable. in such a life there is no peace, but a constant strife\\r\\nbetween the insistence of desire and the powerlessness of will. in one\\r\\nway or another, if our life is to be great and free, we must escape this\\r\\nprison and this strife.\\r\\n\\r\\none way of escape is by philosophic contemplation. philosophic\\r\\ncontemplation does not, in its widest survey, divide the universe into\\r\\ntwo hostile camps--friends and foes, helpful and hostile, good and\\r\\nbad--it views the whole impartially. philosophic contemplation, when it\\r\\nis unalloyed, does not aim at proving that the rest of the universe is\\r\\nakin to man. all acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the self,\\r\\nbut this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. it\\r\\nis obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by a study\\r\\nwhich does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that\\r\\ncharacter, but adapts the self to the characters which it finds in its\\r\\nobjects. this enlargement of self is not obtained when, taking the self\\r\\nas it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this self that\\r\\nknowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien.\\r\\nthe desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all\\r\\nself-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of self which it\\r\\ndesires, and of which the self knows that it is capable. self-assertion,\\r\\nin philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to\\r\\nits own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than self, and the\\r\\nself sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. in contemplation, on\\r\\nthe contrary, we start from the not-self, and through its greatness the\\r\\nboundaries of self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe\\r\\nthe mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor this reason greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies\\r\\nwhich assimilate the universe to man. knowledge is a form of union\\r\\nof self and not-self; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and\\r\\ntherefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with\\r\\nwhat we find in ourselves. there is a widespread philosophical tendency\\r\\ntowards the view which tells us that man is the measure of all things,\\r\\nthat truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals\\r\\nare properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created\\r\\nby the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. this view, if\\r\\nour previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to\\r\\nbeing untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of\\r\\nall that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to self. what\\r\\nit calls knowledge is not a union with the not-self, but a set of\\r\\nprejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between\\r\\nus and the world beyond. the man who finds pleasure in such a theory of\\r\\nknowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear\\r\\nhis word might not be law.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe true philosophic contemplation, on the contrary, finds its\\r\\nsatisfaction in every enlargement of the not-self, in everything\\r\\nthat magnifies the objects contemplated, and thereby the subject\\r\\ncontemplating. everything, in contemplation, that is personal or\\r\\nprivate, everything that depends upon habit, self-interest, or desire,\\r\\ndistorts the object, and hence impairs the union which the intellect\\r\\nseeks. by thus making a barrier between subject and object, such\\r\\npersonal and private things become a prison to the intellect. the free\\r\\nintellect will see as god might see, without a _here_ and _now_,\\r\\nwithout hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs\\r\\nand traditional prejudices, calmly, dispassionately, in the sole and\\r\\nexclusive desire of knowledge--knowledge as impersonal, as purely\\r\\ncontemplative, as it is possible for man to attain. hence also the free\\r\\nintellect will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into\\r\\nwhich the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge\\r\\nbrought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon\\r\\nan exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs\\r\\ndistort as much as they reveal.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of\\r\\nphilosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom\\r\\nand impartiality in the world of action and emotion. it will view\\r\\nits purposes and desires as parts of the whole, with the absence of\\r\\ninsistence that results from seeing them as infinitesimal fragments in\\r\\na world of which all the rest is unaffected by any one man\\'s deeds. the\\r\\nimpartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth,\\r\\nis the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in\\r\\nemotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only\\r\\nto those who are judged useful or admirable. thus contemplation enlarges\\r\\nnot only the objects of our thoughts, but also the objects of our\\r\\nactions and our affections: it makes us citizens of the universe, not\\r\\nonly of one walled city at war with all the rest. in this citizenship\\r\\nof the universe consists man\\'s true freedom, and his liberation from the\\r\\nthraldom of narrow hopes and fears.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; philosophy\\r\\nis to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its\\r\\nquestions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be\\r\\ntrue, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because\\r\\nthese questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich\\r\\nour intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which\\r\\ncloses the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the\\r\\ngreatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also\\r\\nis rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe\\r\\nwhich constitutes its highest good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbibliographical note\\r\\n\\r\\nthe student who wishes to acquire an elementary knowledge of philosophy\\r\\nwill find it both easier and more profitable to read some of the works\\r\\nof the great philosophers than to attempt to derive an all-round view\\r\\nfrom handbooks. the following are specially recommended:\\r\\n\\r\\n     plato: _republic_, especially books vi and vii.\\r\\n     descartes: _meditations_.\\r\\n     spinoza: _ethics_.\\r\\n     leibniz: _the monadology_.\\r\\n     berkeley: _three dialogues between hylas and philonous_.\\r\\n     hume: _enquiry concerning human understanding_.\\r\\n     kant: _prolegomena to any future metaphysic_.'"
